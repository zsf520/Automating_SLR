  abstract={Crop monitoring and diagnosis are crucial for efficient agricultural production, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Remote Sensing can assist in achieving this goal. This article offers an automated Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of UAV Remote Sensing for crop monitoring and diagnosis. This review analyzes the primary scientific applications and trends in this area using Deep Learning techniques to automatically select relevant articles and validate them through full reading. The SLR collected over 800 papers, of which 64 met the selection process. The articles selected by Deep Learning classifiers were successfully cataloged with high accuracy in pre-selecting articles for review. F1 scores of 93% were achieved in tests with unpublished examples for the classifier model. The review of the 64 primary studies reported a peak in UAV Remote Sensing applications in 2020, attributed to the increasing diffusion of precision farming practices with technological equipment. The UAV Remote Sensing application objectives included crop monitoring, pest and disease detection, yield prediction, and plant nutrition. Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are widely used for UAV Remote Sensing analysis. The NDVI is the most applied vegetation index for crop condition assessment and monitoring. The proposed solution for automating the literature selection process for precision agriculture-related scientific articles can be used in other areas that require extensive literature review.},

  abstract={In the present paper, a framework for the continued supporting a systematic literature review (SLR) is proposed, which includes the application of text mining methods in order to automate the classification of scientific publications and the more in-depth analysis of their content. For this purpose, a dataset is created from the titles, abstracts and keywords of papers, included in a systematic literature review on the application of semantic technologies in bibliographic databases. Data analytics methods are applied - frequency analysis of words and word combinations; linear regression for trend exploration; text classification, where the categories are the applied semantic technologies or the researched problems in accordance with a pre-defined classification framework. The vector space model enriched with PMI (pointwise mutual information) measure is used for the classification. An assessment of the text classification performance in terms of various measures is made and the obtained results are summarized.},

  volume={2020},
  number={},
  pages={673-679},
  abstract={The success of procurement process in construction projects is based on the total procured material's cost and time of delivery. However, in Bahrain, the clients face a time and cost loss due to the construction sector's dependence on paper-based procurement mediums, fragmentation of the building process between clients, contractors and suppliers, and control of contractors in providing materials. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a development of a mobile application prototype that is expected to act as an automated procurement medium, act as a central medium of communication, and provide a direct link between clients and suppliers. This is believed to enhance the excessive cost and time of procured construction materials. Methodologically, a waterfall System development life cycle (SDLC) methodology of two phases and seven processes was employed to develop the mobile application “SARAY”, while systematic literature review (SLR) and content analysis in addition to two questionnaire techniques were all employed to identify the problems facing the procurement process, and collect user requirements along with a third questionnaire was employed to evaluate the application's usability based on Nielsen and mobile heuristics. Empirically, research findings revealed the existence of the problem, identified the reasons and requirements underpinning, and informed the need for a dynamic mobile application prototype supplemented by 82.7% of respondents who confirmed the time and cost loss of regular procurement and 59.7% and 92% willingness of development of such a mobile application for individual and company levels. In terms of the development, eight user and system functional requirements were collected, analyzed, & documented, including, register supplier, register client, manage client and supplier records, create and manage supplier store, select material, place an order, make Payment, and manage order. User interfaces & database records were designed, implemented, installed, tested, and evaluated, demonstrating 86% of usability achievement.},

  abstract={Development of mobile applications and hence testing them with automated tools are rapidly achieving grounds on the technology market with the explosive evolution, demand and use of mobile technology. Although automated software testing has been a topic of research for many years, automation testing on mobile application is being a key topic in the software engineering industry and hence the development and introduction of new automated tools have gained attention in the recent years. This research aims at identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing the current state-of-the-art of automated testing on mobile application with special focus on to the popular mobile application platform "Android". A systematic literature review was conducted on studies retrieved from electronic search space. Various literature reviewed and referred there in, as a conclusion, its obvious that none of the techniques used in automated testing is alone inadequate and a combination of them works well as an effective testing strategy. Also, the challenges thus faced by the practitioners of automated testing could be still mitigated with an efficient selection of testing tool.},

  pages={09-16},
  abstract={A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) allows us to combine and analyze data from multiple (published and unpublished) studies. Though it provides a complete and comprehensive empirical evidence of an area of interest, the results we usually get from the data synthesis phase of an SLR include huge tables and graphs and thus, for users, it is a tedious and time-consuming job to get the required results. In this work, we propose to semi-automate some steps which can be used to fetch the information from an SLR, beyond the traditional tables, graphs, and plots. The automation is performed using Semantic Web technologies like ontology, Jena API and SPARQL queries. The Semantic Web, also called Web 3.0, provides a common framework and thus allows us to share and re-use the data across the applications and enterprises. It can be used to integrate, extract, and infer the most relevant data required by the users, which are hidden behind the huge information on the Web. We also provide an easy-to-use user interface in order to allow users to perform different searches and find their required SLR results easily and quickly. Finally, we present the results of a preliminary user study performed to analyze the amount of time users need to extract their required information, both via the SLR tables and our proposal. The results revealed that with our system the users get their required information in less time compared to the manual system.},

  pages={01-08},
  abstract={The User Interface (UI) is a fundamental part of web interfaces, being considered a fundamental aspect of user satisfaction when using a web application. The UI that offers a good User Experience (UX) is the one that makes the interaction as simple and efficient as possible for the user to achieve the previously desired goals. In this way, web interfaces that have adaptive interfaces tend to offer a better UX, as they seek to adapt to the needs and desires of users. Therefore, this paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the most used algorithms for the development of Adaptive Web Interfaces (AWI). The results indicate that the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, both to improve the performance of some task and to induce results, are the most popular ways to develop AWI. During the execution of SLR, 294 articles were analyzed using automated and manual searches, and inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria were applied to them. The research findings allow us to state that the topic is quite relevant to the academic community, with an average publication of 20 papers each year.1},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Nowadays, processing vehicle license plate data has become a common and challenging subject of research in Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence. There are various methods proposed to address this problem due to the different shapes and sizes of license plates in different countries. License plate recognition can be used for different purposes, including parking lots, public and private entrances, traffic monitoring systems, cargo control in airports or harbours, and security issues such as finding stolen cars. The technology for license plate recognition is known by different names, including automatic number-plate recognition, automatic vehicle identification, car license plate recognition, and optical character recognition for cars. This technology converts image data from a camera into a character format that can be processed in a database for specific applications. Optical character recognition methods can identify the characters on license plates with great accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review of the most common challenges and methods used for optical character recognition in automated number plate recognition systems, as well as their level of recognition accuracy.},

  abstract={This work aims to investigate, by means of a Systematic Literature Review, to evaluate the current state of the use of artificial intelligence in automated pupillometric technology and its application in helping to diagnose diseases, to identify the methods and equipment used and propose case new equipment based on computer vision is feasible. We also investigated the accuracy of methodologies and equipment that use computerized pupilometry to identify pathologies or disorders, as well as the viability and usability of existing pupilometers. In this sense, creating a pupilometer capable of stimulating and varying wavelengths, providing an interface to preview the exam, and embedding the classification algorithms is a great challenge. In this systematic review of the literature, we consider publications from the last ten years (2010 - 2020) indexed by seven solid scientific databases. The review identified a vast amount of work on pupillometry; however, a small amount related to the construction and viability of a pupilometer with an embedded system, easy to use and with a preview interface. Having identified this, we propose a new methodology for the construction of the pupilometer as well as the algorithm for extracting the characteristics through pupilometry.},

  abstract={Background--By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective--This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method--We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results--The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion--This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.},

  abstract={The discipline of information systems (IS) at the university of Bahrain (UOB) is characterized by its dynamicity and diversity in terms of the employment of diverse and up to date information technologies to achieve the strategic goals and dynamic operational objectives of organizations. However, the UOB-IS graduates and IS job employers alongside face difficulties in job seeking/provision. Seekers hardly find the best matching job offerings to their degree qualifications and skills, while employers hardly find the best candidates for the required job positions. This project is aimed at developing a Bahraini web-based job offering portal (J4IS) that acts as an automated recruiter for the job seekers and employers to facilitate an efficient and professional medium of communication and time and cost reduction tool to seek/provide suitable jobs for both sides. The theoretical framework is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and web content analysis (CA) techniques. For the portal's application development, a six phased system development life cycle (SDLC) methodology was employed at which three questionnaires, two of which were conducted for collecting user and system requirements, while the third was for the web portal's evaluation. The research outcomes recognized the nature of the Bahraini workforce and the qualifications and skills of the UOB-IS graduates, the shortcomings of the commercial online job portals and the related reasons, and subsequently informed the user (seekers and employers) requirements of the developed “J4IS” which revealed a 94% of usability acceptance.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology promises that it can transform completely modern society and its applications in the near future. Its main characteristics could change activities that are related to public politics and services, such as administrative processes, security, privacy, transparency, integrity, and confidentiality. The citizens concern about the potential risks, that are mainly related to data security, respectively documents falsification in a corrupted and non-transparent government. Not only in terms of administrative efficiency, but also in terms of boosting confidence, transparency, and accessibility of services, blockchain technology has the potential to play a major role in the digitalization of the public sector. Blockchain-based solutions facilitate citizen-government collaboration by safely streamlining and automating procedures while maintaining privacy and secrecy. To better understand the adoption of blockchain in public administration, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) including 32 primary papers in this study.

  year={2023},
  volume={49},
  number={8},
  pages={4213-4242},
  abstract={Microservices architecture has gained significant traction, in part owing to its potential to deliver scalable, robust, agile, and failure-resilient software products. Consequently, many companies that use large and complex software systems are actively looking for automated solutions to decompose their monolith applications into microservices. This paper rigorously examines 35 research papers selected from well-known databases using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol and snowballing method, extracting data to answer the research questions, and presents the following four contributions. First, the Monolith to Microservices Decomposition Framework (M2MDF) which identifies the major phases and key elements of decomposition. Second, a detailed analysis of existing decomposition approaches, tools and methods. Third, we identify the metrics and datasets used to evaluate and validate monolith to microservice decomposition processes. Fourth, we propose areas for future research. Overall, the findings suggest that monolith decomposition into microservices remains at an early stage and there is an absence of methods for combining static, dynamic, and evolutionary data. Insufficient tool support is also in evidence. Furthermore, standardised metrics, datasets, and baselines have yet to be established. These findings can assist practitioners seeking to understand the various dimensions of monolith decomposition and the community's current capabilities in that endeavour. The findings are also of value to researchers looking to identify areas to further extend research in the monolith decomposition space.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={332-337},
  abstract={Software quality prediction is the process of evaluating the software developed for various metrics like defect prediction, bug localisation, effort estimation etc. To evaluate these metrics a myriad of techniques have been developed in the literature, from manual assessment to application of machine learning and statistical testing. These methodologies, however, had lower accuracy in determining SQPMs due to their inability to model the complex relationships in the training data. With the wide emergence of deep learning, not only has the accuracy of the pre-existing models enhanced, but it has also opened doors for new metrics that could be evaluated and automated. This study performs a systematic literature review of research papers published from January 1990 to January 2019 that used deep learning to evaluate software quality prediction metrics (SQPM). The paper identifies 20 primary studies and 7 categories of application of deep learning in SQPM. Models using deep learning techniques significantly outperform other traditional methodologies in almost all studies. The concept and external threats to the models are limited, however the time taken to train these models is large. The techniques, currently predominantly applied for defect prediction, have shown promising results in other diverse software engineering fields like code search and effort estimation by modeling the source code efficiently. There is, hence, scope for incorporating deep learning further with pragmatic use and diverse application. The need to find scalable solutions, however, still persists.},

  volume={5},
  number={},
  pages={3909-3943},
  abstract={Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7%) and evaluation (36.2%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

  title={EEG signal analysis using deep learning: A systematic literature review}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) is very crucial for understanding the dynamic healthy and pathological complex processes in the brain. However, the manual analysis of the EEG signal is very complex, time-consuming, and depends on the expertise and experience of the users. Hence, nowadays research is conducted on automated EEG signal analysis using artificial intelligence and computer-aided technologies. This would allow fast and highly accurate results. The goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the EEG signal analysis using deep learning (DL).Methods: This systematic literature review of EEG processing using Deep Learning (DL) was achieved on Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, resulting in 403 identified papers. All collected studies were analyzed based on main disorders studied, type of tasks performed, data source, stages of analysis, and DL architecture.Results: DL in EEG processing is promising in various research applications. It covered the common neurological disorders diagnosis such as epilepsy, movement disorder, depression, schizophrenia, autism, alcohol use, attention, memory, sleep, pain, etc. The main tasks covered by the included studies are detection and classification. The average range of data sources utilized by the included studies is 127 subjects with an EEG recording a total duration of 458 hours. In fact, we identified the use of a plethora of DL architecture for EEG analysis. 57% of papers used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whereas Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were the architecture choice of about 12% of papers. Combinations of CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were used in 13% of studies. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Autoencoder (AEs) were used in 5% and 4% of papers respectively. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and other hybrid architectures appeared in 1% of studies.Conclusion: This systematic review showed that DL is a powerful tool to process, analyze, and interpret EEG data without requiring extraction steps. These intelligent models can allow self-learning from the training data. On the other hand, DL models need a lot of data to learn, while suffering from a lack of confidence due to their black-box nature. Hence, studies on transfer learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could help in solving such issues. Big Data, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and closed-loop technology can also help DL-based systems in achieving fast, and accurate processing of EEG recordings.},

  abstract={Smart Logistics (SL) offers a competitive advantage for e-commerce by utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as IoT, AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, 5G, etc. This technology automates, optimizes, and enables real-time tracking and monitoring of shipments, predicts, and prevents delays, and optimizes delivery routes and schedules. It also provides greater visibility and control, allowing e-commerce businesses to react quickly and efficiently to changes in demand or supply. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of digitalization on trade logistics in e-commerce, emphasizing the significance of smart logistics for the e-commerce industry. We reviewed 288 articles published in the last decade in the Scopus database to assess the maturity of research in this area. For researchers, this study provides a better understanding of smart e-commerce logistics and identifies research gaps in the literature. For e-commerce professionals, it can help them adopt the latest technological trends in their logistics. Through a systematic literature review and network analysis approach, the study has contributed by identifying 5 clusters related to ICT application fields in e-commerce and 5 clusters related to important ICT enablers in smart logistics. We also identified several research gaps and areas for future study, including the underutilization of computer vision technology and the need for further research on product quality inspection and accessibility for people with disabilities. Additionally, we suggest exploring the power of deep learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and optimizing sensing data volume for minimizing costs associated with data storage and transfer. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in smart logistics for e-commerce and serves as a guide for future research in this field.},

This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

  abstract={The successful use of Business Analytics is increasingly becoming a differentiating competitive factor. The ability to extract data-driven insights and integrate them into decision-making is becoming growingly important. The underlying technologies are evolving exponentially, the value proposition differs from simple descriptive applications to automated decision-making. Existing approaches found in literature and practice to classify those levels only insufficiently mark down the boundaries between the different technology levels. As a consequence, it is often unclear which characteristics of the technology interact with the working environment, which can be described as a socio-technical system. Using a systematic literature review, this paper identifies the characteristics of Business Analytics and delineates three types of Business Analytics based on case studies. Thus, a starting point for the socio-technical system design and optimization for the use of Business Analytics is created.},
