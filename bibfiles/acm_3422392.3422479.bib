abstract = {Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.},

abstract = {The global pandemic of COVID19 demanded that professors rethink teaching strategies considering the use of online environments due to the social isolation stipulated to reduce the rate of contagion of the disease. A challenge for software engineering professors is to develop fundamental professional skills in students who are in the process of learning using these virtual environments. The purpose of this study is to identify how an online educational hackathon can support students of a Software Engineering program to develop professional skills. We also seek to understand how intense collaboration takes place between student teams, considering the digital context for the production of a technological solution. We conducted a Case Study on an educational hackathon that took place in the online context, collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. As some results, the skills that students most considered that this hackathon helped them to develop were communication, initiative, and creativity/innovation, among others. Also, the strategies of collaboration adopted by the students during this competition, considering the remote context. Therefore, the main contribution is the identification of how the realization of this event supported students to develop professional skills and to practice collaboration skills with each other.},

abstract = {College hackathons have become popular in the past decade, with tens of thousands of students now participating each year across hundreds of campuses. Since hackathons are informal learning environments where students learn and practice coding without any faculty supervision, they are an important site for computing education researchers to study as a complement to studying formal classroom learning environments. However, despite their popularity, little is known about why students choose to attend these events, what they gain from attending, and conversely, why others choose *not* to attend. This paper presents a mixed methods study that examines student perceptions of college hackathons by focusing on three main questions: 1.) Why are students motivated to attend hackathons? 2.) What kind of learning environment do these events provide? 3.) What factors discourage students from attending? Through semi-structured interviews with six college hackathon attendees (50% female), direct observation at a hackathon, and 256 survey responses from college students (42% female), we discovered that students were motivated to attend for both social and technical reasons, that the format generated excitement and focus, and that learning occurred incidentally, opportunistically, and from peers. Those who chose not to attend or had negative experiences cited discouraging factors such as physical discomfort, lack of substance, an overly competitive climate, an unwelcoming culture, and fears of not having enough prior experience. We conclude by discussing ideas for making college hackathons more broadly inclusive and welcoming in light of our study's findings.},

abstract = {Hackathons are fast-paced events where competitors work in teams to go from an idea to working software or hardware within a single day or a weekend and demonstrate their creation to a live audience of peers. Due to the "fun" and informal nature of such events, they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum of students, especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In this paper, we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon events over the past two years, with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 student participants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events, we observed a significant amount of peer-learning -- students teaching each other how to solve specific challenges and learn new skills. The events featured mentors from both the university and industry, who provided round-the-clock hands-on support, troubleshooting and advice. Due to the gamified format of the events, students were heavily motivated to learn new skills due to practical applicability and peer effects, rather than merely academic metrics. Some teams continued their hacks as long-term projects, while others formed new student groups to host lectures and practice building prototypes on a regular basis. Using a combined analysis of post-event surveys, student academic records and source-code commit log data from the event, we share insights, demographics, statistics and anecdotes from hosting these hackathons.},

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from an observation carried out during a hackathon conducted in France with 70 participants. A survey was also developed to analyse the participants’ perception of the different dimensions of the intra-team collaboration. In this study a positive impact of a hackathon was observed on the intra-team collaboration and on the development of hard and soft skills of the participants. The format of a hackathon could be used at the company scale to speed up employees’ learning process. Thus, team learning could be improved and accelerated by the hackathon approach, through the sharing of experience and knowledge of people with various backgrounds, the caring nature of the team, and their willingness to meet the challenge all together.},

abstract = {The workshop and hackathon on developing Information Retrieval Evaluation Resources using Lucene (L4IR) was held on the 8th and 9th of September, 2016 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK and funded by the ESF Elias Network. The event featured three main elements: (i) a series of keynote and invited talks on industry, teaching and evaluation; (ii) planning, coding and hacking where a number of groups created modules and infrastructure to use Lucene to undertake TREC based evaluations; and (iii) a number of breakout groups discussing challenges, opportunities and problems in bridging the divide between academia and industry, and how we can use Lucene for teaching and learning Information Retrieval (IR). The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.},

abstract = {Some researchers are starting to point out the importance of hackathons as an alternative venue for college students practicing and learning. Many positive aspects were highlighted such as peer learning and improvements in problem-solving, project management and task priority analysis. However, this hackathon phenomena is something that is happening outside the curriculum, with scarce reports of teachers taking advantage of similar approaches in undergraduate courses. In this article, we present our experience of an undergraduate introductory course on Distributed Systems where students have to participate in a "hack day" at the end of the semester. The goal is to take advantage of the hackathon model to bring a more realistic and engaging scenario where students can develop their course project and put into practice what they have learned in the semester. With this model, they have to do face-to-face group work and also have the opportunity to share knowledge with other groups. Our experience indicates positive results with this approach. Students reported a high level of engagement and enthusiasm. There were different situations of peer learning being reported, and according to their perception, students felt they learned more in the hack day than in lectures or laboratory practice.},

abstract = {In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities had to be done remotely as a way to avoid the spread of the disease. Instead of shifting to an online learning model, it consisted of a transition to what was called Emergency Remote Teaching. This is a strategy to keep activities going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles for students to continue engaged.Before the pandemic, hackathons -- short-lived events (1 to 3 days) of intensive collaboration to develop software prototypes -- were being explored as an alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an online hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their semester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency remote teaching period. We describe the intervention and analyze the students' perspective of the approach. One of the findings was the importance of the Discord communication tool -- used by students for playing games -- which helped them socialize and be engaged in synchronous group work, "virtually collocated".},

abstract = {Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.},

abstract = {It has become increasingly important for youngsters to acquire digital competencies and 21st century skills. Schools across different countries have introduced in their curricula activities and topics on these efforts, however, to varying degrees and with varying effectiveness, depending on a number of reasons. In this paper we report on a study on the effectiveness of the DaVinciLab Youth Hackathon (YH) workshops as a form of intervention in the school system in order to increase digital competencies and 21st skills (4Cs - Communication, Collaboration, Critical Reflection and Creativity) among students and teachers as part of the implementation of basic digital education (Digitale Grundbildung) in Austrian schools. Our methodical research approach included participating observations of YH workshops in and outside the school setting, quantitative surveys and a literature review in the field of learning science. Our evaluation showed that the workshops can be an effective addition and support for schools to close current gaps in the curriculum for basic digital education and to implement parts of the curriculum through project and team-based teaching and learning methods. In order to integrate the format more strongly into the Austrian educational ecosystem, longer-term funding and better integration into training programs for teachers/in-service teachers would be needed. Finally, long-term support through research studies that are carried out in cooperation with different educational institutions could be helpful in future improvements.},

abstract = {Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.},

abstract = {Collegiate hackathons are informal learning environments where students build new projects in a limited amount of time and often compete for prizes. Previous hackathon research has shown that students go to these events to learn new technical skills, work on projects with friends, or network with the technical community; however, little is known about the different ways in which students collaborate with other participants and how students' event goals affect their trajectory at the hackathon. In the literature, students are typically described as working in competitive teams that build one project to be entered into a competition. However, there are gaps when it comes to discussing other ways students may work together or what other non-competitive projects/activities students may want to engage with at a hackathon. This paper reports on different collaboration styles and event goals documented at a Spring 2018 female-focused hackathon. Findings include three types of collaboration styles: team-based, cooperative group, and individual participation; as well as four types of event goals: competition, exploration, dabbling, and observing. These findings can inform the collegiate hackathon literature and help hackathons diversify their events by offering insight into ways diverse participants choose to participate at a hackathon and offering design suggestions that mainstream collegiate hackathons can adopt to be more inclusive of different types of students.},

Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.},

abstract = {1As technology increasingly pervades the daily life of teachers and students, finding sustainable ways to successfully integrate innovative technologies in classrooms remains a challenge. This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.},

abstract = {Collegiate hackathons are marathon-style, project building competitions where students can learn computing in an informal environment, build community, network with members of the technology industry, and be more productive members of the workforce. I am interested in understanding the social climate of hackathons and how it affects hackathon participants, particularly women and non-binary students, who only make up 23% of collegiate hackathon attendees. I will be exploring two lines of inquiry: (1) to explore the experiences of hackathon attendees to gain a deeper understanding about why participants do (or do not) participate in hackathons, what motivates them to attend, and what engages them at these events; and (2) to explore the ways collegiate hackathons can adapt their design practices to create an inclusive and equitable events for marginalized and minority students.},

abstract = {Hackathons have attracted increasing interest in recent years, and whereas much of the research focus on the role of hackathons as potential means for education, innovation, or municipal engagement, this paper focuses on the creative process of a hackathon. We present an explorative, autobiographical case study of a team at a hackathon and in the analysis we identify four factors, which in particular impacted the team's design judgement during the hackathon: 1) The hackathon format, 2) the available tools and materials, 3) the participants' domain knowledge, and 4) the participants' technical knowledge. Though the factors are evident in most design processes, we discuss how the four factors in a hackathon setting influenced the design judgement in a particular way and how the factors influenced the creative engagement in developing technology in the hackathon. We discuss potential implications for future research on how to understand design judgements made under the particular circumstances of a hackathon.},

It was organized as an educational and research project to tap into the dynamics of transdisciplinary teams challenged with a specific requirement. In our case, it was to build a Bauhaus-themed German Language Learning VR App. We constructed this experiment to simulate how representatives of different disciplines may work together towards a very specific purpose under time pressure. So, each participating team consisted of members of various expert-fields: software development (Unity or Unreal), design, psychology and linguistics. The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes. We also provide guidelines on how to prepare the participants to work in rapid prototyping VR environments and benefit from such experiences in the long term.},

abstract = {Hackathons are short-lived events, typically lasting from 1 to 3 days, where participants gather into groups to tackle a challenge and present a proof of concept in the form of software or hardware prototype, motivated by a common theme. Studies show that learning is one of the primary motivations for people joining hackathons, where situated and collaborative learning take place. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. By taking that into account, we considered bringing hackathons into the classroom. This paper presents a case study of an Internet of Things (IoT) undergraduate course where a hackathon is used as a learning instrument, leveraging on challenge-based learning to motivate students to find and develop a suitable semester project. We utilize a mixed-method approach where quantitative and qualitative data are used to analyze the perspective of students about the effectiveness of that approach.},

Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.},

Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.},

abstract = {This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.},

We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.},

While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.},

abstract = {Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising approach to broadening participation in computer science and engineering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perseverance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engagement in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10 weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engagement when participants present their work to others at the end of events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education and broadening participation in computing by outlining several conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young people.},

abstract = {App Lab (https://code.org/applab) is Code.org's rapid-prototyping environment for creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-powered web applications. It was created as part of a rich set of instructional resources designed for teachers of the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Yet, App Lab far exceeds the needs of CSP, and would be an appropriate learning environment for students in any CS0/CS1 class, even at the university level. App Lab gives novice programmers access to capabilities previously reserved for courses that require sophisticated tech setup and knowledge of both front and backend web development, server-side scripting, databases, etc.Rather than focusing on curriculum, this workshop will focus on how App Lab works as a programming tool in its own right, and how it was designed to aid and motivate student learning. Participants will get hands-on time with some of App Lab's more advanced features guided by a Code.org product manager, while working with the education team to help understand the educational philosophy that went into its development. Participants will come away with exemplars that highlight App Lab's possibilities, practice with some of its richer features, and do a hackathon to create something to share with each other (and the world)! Finally, we will end with a discussion about how best to integrate App Lab into existing courses.App Lab was developed as part of collaboration between Code.org and David Bau (Google), creator of PencilCode.net.A laptop is required for this session. All other materials will be provided.},

abstract = {Hackathons are time-bound collaborative computer science competitions increasingly popular at undergraduate institutions. It is often claimed that their failure-friendly environment helps students become better computer scientists. The same features which encourage risk-taking, however, may increase imposter syndrome and stereotype threat. Furthermore, if hackathons really do radically celebrate emergent projects, why do so many participants leave without showcasing their work? This work addresses two research questions: 1) Do students consider hackathons as a space which is safe for taking risks and learning through failure? And 2) How does participants’ perception of risk affect their decisions to persist or quit the main event competition? Extensive mixed methods data was collected from student attendees, professors, and industry sponsors of three undergraduate computer science hackathons. Constructionism was used to understand participant learning through making in a failure-friendly environment, and social cognitive career theory was used to determine how risk affects decisions on continued participation. Results showed participants largely felt that risk was good for learning, although they did worry about their classwork, health, meeting their own standards, and public embarrassment. They felt much more free to take risks than in their CS classes, and wanted 60% of the skills they used to be new. External conflicts or an unfinished project were the reasons that half of participants didn’t submit for judging. As almost 80% of hackathon attendees have CS related majors, these findings have implications for how risks can be productively used for learning both at hackathons and CS classes.},

abstract = {Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of collaboration in various domains. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which teams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has thus consequently focused on studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the advantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has led to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that participated in 4 hackathon events across two continents. By analyzing the collected data, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based on individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different strategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams that kept open synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio territories), in a sort of "radical virtual co-location". However, others, such as interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual collaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how technologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this collaboration.},

Therefore, it has become important to address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young programmers and older adult participants. In our paper we describe a case study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar events and an improved process of developing apps that target older adults.},

To proactively address these issues students and faculty of a Midwestern university came up with the idea of hosting their own hackathon in 2010. In general a hackathon event involves the collaborative development of software projects in a concentrated time period. Having hosted five hackathons we have developed a body of knowledge through experience, which we hope will encourage other schools to hold their own hackathons. This paper describes the issues related to retention in computing and technology programs, some of the factors and decisions that have to be made in hosting a hackathon, and some of the side benefits that hackathons produce.},

Since 2014, over 75 co-designers and 400 students have participated in ATHack. We present an overview of the program goals and implementation and share our reflections on the strengths and challenges surrounding the event as organizers, participants, and co-designers. Our reflections include that open communication between co-designers and participants is crucial, and that working on well-scoped, feasible projects is motivating for participants. From a survey (n=48) of ATHack participants from 2014-2019, 89% of respondents would recommend the event and 75% reported that they learned about disability and user-centered design. Our reflections suggest that the collaborative hackathon model can engage students spark innovations in accessible interfaces. We hope this report will inspire and guide others in implementing similar educational and design initiatives.},

We discuss the design process and design of ROOT, an interactive lighting system that aims to stimulate walking and running through supportive, collaborative and social interaction. We exemplify how multidisciplinary HCI approaches in a hackathon setting can contribute to real life urban health challenges.

Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.},

Our work contributes to a growing HCI literature on mental health and wellbeing, as well as understandings of how to imbue appropriate value-sensitivity within the digital design process in these contexts. The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.},

abstract = {Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48 hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019 Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85% of commits were made within the first month, and approximately 77% of the total commits occurred within the first week. Only 7% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of commits divided by the length of the development period was only 0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to help increase the average longevity of the development period for projects.},

High-impact practices are powerful tools in engaging students (NSSE, 2014), perhaps even more so for non-traditional, ESL/ELL, first-generation, and URM students in STEM disciplines by increasing peer and faculty contact, active learning, and high expectations (Goodman). We believe that event-based teaching, such as Game jams and Hackathons provide students with many, if not more of the experiences that are credited with those of commonly identified High Impact Practices (Kuh, 2008).These events also create peer and social networks among participants. While not conclusive - anecdotally the networks of peers and social capacity seem to make a difference in post graduation job search (Mouw). Game Jams and Hackathons are still relatively new in higher education, and while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence as to the benefits reaped by participants of these events, there exists little in the way of long-term studies in the literature that speaks to the academic value of these events.This session will create a conversation among faculty from computer science and other disciplines who are interested in creating these events and their institutions, and developing scholarship to fill in the gaps in the literature around the effects and efficacy of these events on the long-term success of participants.},

abstract = {Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in Feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of "feminist consciousness raising" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just "awareness-raising", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.},

abstract = {This paper explores trust in online-only-collaboration, where a team was gathered to organise a COVID-19 online hackathon with only three days notice. The study is based on the thematic analysis of ten in-depth interviews with the hackathon organisers. The findings report how trust among the organisers was encapsulated in 1) the shared big goal, 2) the significance of real-life networks, 3) a strong lead organiser on the collaboration forming on the fly, and 4) the lack of face-to-face contact in relation to becoming familiar or staying unknown. Technology related findings showed that the collaboration platforms were selected based on familiarity and ease of use. The chosen communication channels created a split between age groups, and transparency of the communication suffered somewhat from one-to-one communications in the background and divided application use. However, trust between the organisers helped them to overcame the transparency challenges. The findings are applicable to societal crisis situations in which technologies are used to build collaboration in aim to address shared challenges.},

abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons, code fests and others have become a global phenomenon. Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.},

Since making games requires some technical knowledge that chemical engineering students do not usually possess, the author is developing a custom-made editor to make games intuitively without needing programming skills. Additionally, a game design workshop is included in the learning experience to ease the difficulties of beginners when creating games. All in all, the strategy facilitates hands on sessions that extend traditional education, during which chemical engineering content is approached differently than in a conventional class. Students work in teams, embrace a constructivist learning approach to create an educational game and participate in a hackathon-like event (game jam) to mention some of the features included in this learning experience.},

abstract = {The lack of diversity in computing is a well-known issue. This poster is a work-in-progress report on Curated Pathways to Innovation (CPI), a web-based tool which gathers existing online resources for computer science (CS) engagement and learning to allow students to learn more about CS careers and content, with a particular focus on improving participation of K-12 girls and under-represented minorities in CS. This project is a collaboration of people from academia in CS and social science, K-12 education, non-profit, and industry. We are about halfway through a 3-year pilot deployment of CPI with all students in a low-income, primarily Latino/a middle school with nearly 500 students, and smaller deployments have been undertaken and are planned for 2018-19. In addition to online content, we have created in-person experiences, including reverse science fairs, summer camps, and a hackathon, which are tracked in the CPI tool. To measure impact, we conduct regular surveys with the students measuring their interest in CS, self-efficacy, and other metrics. Our evaluation of the system based on survey data has helped inform the development of the system and curriculum, but remains preliminary. This poster also discusses the tool itself. It uses gamification in the form of badges to measure student progress. From the beginning, the vision was to use machine learning to customize recommendations based on students' demographics, background, and past performance. This integration is coming to fruition at the same time we are including more interesting visuals in the UI, such as an avatar and animations.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional educational methods, forcing a quick transition to emergency remote learning. With the subsequent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, universities and society as a whole gradually resumed in-person activities. Students and university staff had to readjust to on-site learning and its associated challenges. This experience report specifically focuses on a course at University [omitted] dedicated to the design and development of Distributed Applications. Students engaged in a hybrid hackathon – an activity blending in-person and remote work – as part of the course. Despite their preferences for in-person collaboration, the majority of the students opted for remote participation. The goal of this report is to understand the students’ choices and adaptations to this new post-pandemic educational setting. We collected data through an anonymous survey and group interviews, revealing that the preference for remote work stemmed from convenience. Despite this, the distant collaboration allowed students to develop various soft skills. This exploration can shed light on future educational approaches in a world where online and in-person interactions can coexist.},

abstract = {Mapathons and hackathons are short-lived events with different purposes. A mapathon is a collaborative effort for collecting geographic data in unmapped areas, while hackathons are focused on application development. Mapathon outputs need to be high quality to be reusable, but often, when applications are later built on top of map data, there is a mismatch between data collected and application requirements. We conducted an international collaboration project aiming to address this situation by creating a circular process where geographic information is collected in a mapathon and later used in a hackathon. Based on user feedback this cycle can be repeated so the collected data and developed applications can be improved. In this event report, we describe the two mapathon-hackathon cycles that were part of our pilot to validate that process. We present their outcomes and some lessons learned. We focused on the so-called "blue economy" (i.e. the sustainable use of marine and ocean resources for economic growth and improved livelihoods in coastal areas.) as the target domain for this pilot. Data for carefully selected areas of the South African coast was collected through in mapathons and later use in hackathons. The mapathons were held in South Africa, and the hackathons took place in Brazil.},

abstract = {Hackathon formats have been praised for their potential for promoting innovative thinking and making in a short time-frame. For this reason, hackathons have also been embraced by many researchers who use hackathons as part of their research in various ways. Through an extensive review of 381 publications published during a 10 year time span, we document the multiple ways in which hackathons are embraced and used by researchers The paper contributes to a better understanding of hackathons as part of research by providing a broad overview as a resource for researchers. We identify three main motivations for using hackathons as part of research: 1) Structuring learning, 2) structuring processes, and 3) enabling participation. For each of the motivations, we identify research with hackathons, and research on hackathons as two main categories. Drawing on several examples from the review we discuss benefits and challenges of using hackathons as part of research.},

This style of competition is more friendly to first and second year students, less competitive, less of a time commitment, and more collaborative. Two different competition formats are presented. The first is called "Problem Solving Speed Dating", which works by pairing upperclassmen and underclassmen in a speed dating type exercise. The second is called "Unwrapped Collaborative Problem Solving", where students work on a team but with very specific (and intentionally restrictive) roles. Both competition formats were tested in five different workshops over the course of several years involving around 250 undergraduate students. Students reporting receiving similar benefits to a hackathon including: problem solving skills, teamwork, building community, and networking with industry.},

abstract = {Goal-directed problem-solving labs can lead a student to believe that the most important achievement in a first programming course is to get programs working. This is counter to research indicating that code comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers. We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and furthermore, that students weren't making the connection between code comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200 pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.},

abstract = {Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests, Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper, we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University of Technology - Paran\'{a}. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.},

abstract = {The field of data analysis seeks to extract value from data for either business or scientific benefit. This field has seen a renewed interest with the advent of big data technologies and a new organizational role called data scientist. Even with the new found focus, the task of analyzing large amounts of data is still challenging and time-consuming.The essence of data analysis involves setting up data pipe-lines which consists of several operations that are chained together - starting from data collection, data quality checks, data integration, data analysis and data visualization (including the setting up of interaction paths in that visualization).In our opinion, the challenges stem from from the technology diversity at each stage of the data pipeline as well as the lack of process around the analysis.In this paper we present a platform that aims to significantly reduce the time it takes to build data pipelines. The platform attempts to achieve this in following ways. Allow the user to describe the entire data pipeline with a single language and idioms - all the way from data ingestion to insight expression (via visualization and end-user interaction).Provide a rich library of parts that allow users to quickly assemble a data analysis pipeline in the language.Allow for a collaboration model that allows multiple users to work together on a data analysis pipeline as well as leverage and extend prior work with minimal effort.We studied the efficacy of the platform for a data hackathon competition conducted in our organization. The hackathon provided us with a way to study the impact of the approach. Rich data pipelines which traditionally took weeks to build were constructed and deployed in hours. Consequently, we believe that the complexity of designing and running the data analysis pipeline can be significantly reduced; leading to a marked improvement in the productivity of data analysts/data scientists.},

abstract = {As immersive technologies are increasingly being adopted by artists, dancers and developers in their creative work, there is a demand for tools and methods to design compelling ways of embodied interaction within virtual environments. Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.},

abstract = {Computer Science Education is rapidly expanding in the United States[5]. As a part of this expansion, many programs are using university students and industry volunteers for a variety of purposes within schools. These volunteers can bring a wealth of content knowledge and professional experience in their interactions with students [3], and can be inspirational when talking about the problems they work on[1]. Some programs even advocate for the use of professionals for instruction based upon their content knowledge[2]. Although professionals often have a high level of content knowledge, they may lack the training or experience necessary to be effective in the classroom[3, 4]. This panel brings together 4 different organizations with experience working with content expert volunteers with widely disparate preparation in teaching.In this panel we will share lessons learned by the organizations whose programs rely on volunteer instructors and mentors, that combined work with over 1,200 volunteers for multiple years. Topics discussed by the panel will include recruitment and selection of volunteers, volunteer training prior to entering the classroom, appropriate supports for volunteers throughout the experience, volunteer retention strategies, and preliminary efforts at evaluating the implementations. Panelists will also discuss volunteers for short-term engagements such as speaking opportunities and school-based hackathons.},

abstract = {Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.},

abstract = {Populating large-scale structured databases from unstructured sources is a critical and challenging task in data analytics. As automated feature engineering methods grow increasingly prevalent, constructing sufficiently large labeled training sets has become the primary hurdle in building machine learning information extraction systems. In light of this, we have taken a new approach called data programming [7]. Rather than hand-labeling data, in the data programming paradigm, users generate large amounts of noisy training labels by programmatically encoding domain heuristics as simple rules. Using this approach over more traditional distant supervision methods and fully supervised approaches using labeled data, we have been able to construct knowledge base systems more rapidly and with higher quality. Since the ability to quickly prototype, evaluate, and debug these rules is a key component of this paradigm, we introduce DDLite, an interactive development framework for data programming. This paper reports feedback collected from DDLite users across a diverse set of entity extraction tasks. We share observations from several DDLite hackathons in which 10 biomedical researchers prototyped information extraction pipelines for chemicals, diseases, and anatomical named entities. Initial results were promising, with the disease tagging team obtaining an F1 score within 10 points of the state-of-the-art in only a single day-long hackathon's work. Our key insights concern the challenges of writing diverse rule sets for generating labels, and exploring training data. These findings motivate several areas of active data programming research.},

Through building Apps that solve real-world problems relevant to their communities, participants worked collaboratively to build competency, self-efficacy, and identity with computing. Six virtual hackathons were offered since summer 2020, successfully supporting 167 students, among them, 33% Latinas and 7.2% African Americans. Analyses of post-event survey responses, the Apps submitted by project teams, and judging scores and feedback pointed to students' growth in technical and professional skills, computing identity, and self-efficacy. Participants with little to no prior computing experience successfully demonstrated improved coding skills such as using variables, conditional and iterative statements, functions, and data tables. They also developed software engineering skills in teamwork, project management, and effective communication.},

In response to this emergency, the local entrepreneurship ecosystem of S\~{a}o Jo\~{a}o del-Rei, Brazil, spent a great effort to tackle this new reality. This article presents the experience of performing virtual events to foster innovation and raise awareness of the local entrepreneurship culture. The first event was developed under the hackathon format, aiming to encourage the local community to propose technological innovation by developing solutions to assist distance learning in universities and high schools. The other event was a virtual fair presenting local startups to the audience, besides providing online courses related to entrepreneurship and new digital technologies. It is worth noting that those events were organized by a strategic coalition following the triple helix model of innovation, gathering universities, industry, and government. The results achieved through those events reinforce the importance of having an organized local strategic coalition to provide a fast response to social emergencies and provide better adaptation capability to society by creating innovations based on digital entrepreneurship.},

abstract = {Open innovation initiatives aimed at building and proposing service improvements for the Government increasingly include activities of programming marathons for Apps (hackathons), ideation and prototype challenges as different ways to stimulate civic engagement. In this scenario is the Global Gov Jam, a 48-hour event that happens simultaneously in several cities around the world, aiming to involve government people together with citizens to propose innovative ideas for solving governmental problems. This work investigates what are the main motivational aspects of factors that lead people to engage in Global Gov Jam and what are the correlations among those factors. The method used was the replication of a survey applied previously to participants of civic hackathon events, with some adaptations motivated by the characteristics of the type of event we studied. The results show that "thinking outside the box", which gives the possibility of producing innovation without the conventional limitations, is the most significant motivational aspect for participating in this event. Evidence points to the similarity of the main motivational factors, among the results found in the original research on hackathons and this work. We also demonstrate through empirical evidence that there is correlation among motivational factors related to social interactions, such as visibility among peers, performing teamwork, and networking.},

abstract = {This paper presents Songle Sync, a web-based platform on which hundreds of Internet-connected devices - including smartphones, computers, and other physical computing devices - can be controlled to synchronize with music playback. It uses music-understanding technologies to dynamically synthesize music-driven multimedia performances from a musical piece of choice. To simultaneously control hundreds of devices, a conventional architecture keeps always-on connections between them. However, it does not scale and suffers from latency and jitter issues when there are various devices with potentially unstable networks. We address this with a novel autonomous control architecture in which each device is notified of forthcoming musical events (e.g., beats and chorus sections) to automatically drive various changes in multimedia performances. Moreover, we provide a development kit of an event-driven multimedia framework for JavaScript, example programs, and an interactive tutorial. To evaluate the platform, we compared latencies, jitters, and amounts of network traffic between ours and the conventional architecture. To examine use cases in the wild, we deployed the platform to drive over a hundred of a variety of devices. We also developed a web browser-based application for a multimedia performance with music playback. It provided audiences of hundreds with a bring-your-own-device experience of synchronized animations on smartphones. In addition, the development kit was used in a two-day hackathon. We report lessons learned from these studies and discuss the future of the Internet of Musical Things.},

abstract = {In late 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has been rapidly growing since then. Molecular and antigen testing methods are very accurate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply. Because the virus affects an infected patient’s lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis. However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited. Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required. We describe a system for automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images. It first segmented images to select only the lung. The segmented part was then fed into a multiclass classification module, which worked well with samples obtained from various sources, which had different aspect ratios, contrast and viewpoints. The system also handled the unbalanced dataset—only a small fraction of images showed COVID-19. Our system achieved 92% of F1-score and 88.1% Marco F1-score on the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School Hackathon Phase 3—Multi-class COVID-19 Chest X-ray challenge public leaderboard.},

This year our attendees will enjoy four keynote speakers: Rajeev Rastogi (Amazon), Qiang Yang (HKUST), Rada Mihalcea (Michigan), and K Ananth Krishnan (Tata Consultancy Services). In 6-7 parallel sessions, our program includes presentations of 171 full research papers, 119 short research papers, and 30 demonstrations of new research advances. The program's focus this year can be seen at a glance in the word cloud at right, constructed from the titles of all accepted research papers. Also on offer are eight tutorials on timely research topics, and six collocated workshops on topics ranging from history to transportation, biomedicine to bias.We are excited about our greatly expanded data analytics competition this year, the CIKM AnalytiCup. During the past nine months, over 1500 teams from all over the world have vied to win over $60,000 in AnalytiCup prizes and travel money by solving real-world analytics problems posed by our corporate sponsors Alibaba/Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau, DataSpark, and Lazada. A fourth competition, a weekend-long hackathon sponsored by DHL, takes place immediately before the conference. The finalists from all four competitions come together on 6 November for a final showdown in front of corporate judges. Solution summaries from finalist teams in the first three competitions can be found in these proceedings. Also new this year are several other events aimed directly at practitioners. During the main conference, we are offering hands-on tutorials on the hot topics of scalable deep learning and scalable data science. The Case Studies track, intended to highlight the experiences and lessons learned by early adopters, debuts this year with 23 studies of technology adoption in interesting applications. And immediately before the main conference, CIKMconnect brings together students and industry for posters, technical discussions, recruiting events, and networking. It takes a village to produce a major conference! Our program committee chairs, senior PC and PC members valiantly and gracefully handled a record total number of submissions: 855 full research papers, 419 short research papers, 80 demos, and 103 case studies. Each submission was reviewed by three program committee members, each a recognized expert in the field, and an independent committee selected the full paper awards recipients.},

In past user studies we have observed that when being presented with collaboration views and word clouds from the system's history engineers start sharing memories linked to those visualizations. In this paper we propose an approach based on a story-telling visualization, which is designed to entice engineers to share and document their tribal memory. Sticky notes can be used to share memories of a system's lifetime events, such as past design rationales but also more casual memories like pictures from after-work beer or a hackathon. We present an early-stage prototype implementation and include two design studies created using that prototype.},

abstract = {Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in representing and involving people with dementia in these events, which had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis presents insights into participants’ motivations, challenges participants faced when constructing their “absent user”, and the design features teams developed to address the social context of the user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for collaborative design events, community building through design, and reification in design.},

However, preparation, execution and evaluation is slow and inefficient due to the lack of streamlined development &amp; analysis environments. Therefore, we demonstrate the prototyping capabilities of "User Studies Made Easy" -- a software framework for multi-tool user studies. To do so, we showcase a simple dashboard HMI, which uses live data from a driving simulation and physiological assessment tools, with an emphasis on how little effort was needed to implement it. Additionally offering the opportunity to participate in a hackathon competition for a trust calibrating dashboard further fosters discussion about possible improvements to USE, as well as the topic of trust and acceptance in automation.},

In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

abstract = {Game jams are hackathon-like events that allow participants to develop a playable game prototype within a time limit. They foster creativity and the exchange of ideas by letting developers with different skill sets collaborate. Having a high-ranking game is a great bonus to a beginning game developer’s r\'{e}sum\'{e} and their pursuit of a career in the game industry. However, participants often face time constraints set by jam hosts while balancing what aspects of their games should be emphasized to have the highest chance of winning. Similarly, hosts need to understand what to emphasize when organizing online jams so that their jams are more popular, in terms of submission rate. In this paper, we study 1,290 past game jams and their 3,752 submissions on itch.io to understand better what makes popular jams and high-ranking games perceived well by the audience. We find that a quality description has a positive contribution to both a jam’s popularity and a game’s ranking. Additionally, more manpower organizing a jam or developing a game increases a jam’s popularity and a game’s high-ranking likelihood. High-ranking games tend to support Windows or macOS, and belong to the “Puzzle”, “Platformer”, “Interactive Fiction”, or “Action” genres. Also, shorter competitive jams tend to be more popular. Based on our findings, we suggest jam hosts and participants improve the description of their products and consider co-organizing or co-participating in a jam. Furthermore, jam participants should develop multi-platform multi-genre games. Finally, jam hosts should introduce a tighter time limit to increase their jam’s popularity.},

abstract = {Brazil's Constitution instituted a few means of direct democracy including the possibility of any citizen to propose a draft bill at a legislative house at the municipal, state or federal level, given the support of a minimum of citizens explicit through their signature. Until today, popular initiative bills' signatures are paper-based, which is not only costly, but also presents problems connected to transparency and safety principles. The Institute for Technology and Society of Rio believed that technology could transform this process and, hence, developed a mobile app called "Mudamos" ("we change" in Portuguese) to prove that it is possible to sign bills of popular initiative electronically. Since the launch of the app Mudamos in March 2017, we have observed that the population has a lot of will to participate and good ideas to propose. However, despite this potential for engagement, citizens experience difficulty when transforming those ideas into draft bills to be presented to legislative houses. Therefore, we have developed "Virada Legislativa" (legal hackathon): a methodology comprising an activity to develop draft bills collectively addressing a single issue and within a timeframe. In this article, we aim to showcase this toolbox for democratic participation, connecting cutting-edge digital innovations on electronic signatures (online) with social innovative methodologies (offline), highlighting the impact we have had throughout this period as well as the challenges faced, and lessons learned.},

However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space.},

LLC participants live in a common residence hall and are provided with an educational, mentoring, and community-building program that supports their progress as students and CS majors. Participants take a "house course," Great Ideas and Insights in Computer Science, as a group, and also take a course on Knowledge and Power: Issues in Women's Leadership. Program activities include study sessions and industry interactions, as well as opportunities to participate in K-12 outreach programs, hackathons, and computing research. To evaluate the program, participants and a similar comparison group are surveyed at the beginning and end of the academic year and a focus group is conducted with program participants. Program participants find the program valuable and would recommend it to others, but both program participants and the comparison group report some lack of confidence in their potential success as computer scientists.},

abstract = {Data literacy and the fundamentals of big data management are becoming interdisciplinary in Higher Education curricula, also due to the widespread need of data science skills. This casts the need for presenting novel (and more engaging) learning activities to students. Data hackathons (also known as datathons) represent a viable option to allow students practicing with real use cases and datasets, as well as addressing their learning experiences collaboratively. Moreover, datathons promise to improve soft skills and offer hands-on learning opportunities. Therefore, we present in this paper a datathon on a publicly available dataset about renewable energy systems. The datathon involved students from three data-focused courses of three different M.S. degrees at the University of Salento (Italy). A detailed analysis of the design, implementation and evaluation choices is proposed, along with a series of gathered insights and lessons learned that might help systematizing the introduction and use of datathons in data education.},

abstract = {Data was a topic previously reserved for expert computer scientists. However, the general public now uses data and visualizations to form opinions and make decisions that affect their lives, such as their health (e.g.: vaccines) and their political opinions (e.g.: gentrification). Unfortunately, few have access to the formal data literacy training required to analyze this data effectively [9]. Existing approaches to provide informal CS education include hackathons [8, 10], after school programs [1], and online tutorials [5]. However, these learning opportunities are often decontextualized from a learner's daily life and require them to go out of their way to learn. Our research investigates techniques to integrate informal learning opportunities seamlessly into people's everyday lives. Prior research in just-in-time learning shows how heuristics can be used in deterministic settings to provide explanations for code [3] and math equations [4]. However, this is challenging when there is no single correct way to interpret and explain content, such as in visualizations. We present Expert Goggles, a browser extension that automatically detects visualizations that people encounter on the web and provides just-in-time, contextually-relevant training modules to scaffold learning and interpretation.},

abstract = {Hackathons have become a popular tool for bringing people together to imagine new possibilities for technology. Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.},

The city is ranked at the top on the list of Italian cities in terms of quality of life and quality of food.The conference continues to be a truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554 authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and South America (50). In total, a total of 175 papers, one panel, and 16 working groups were submitted. Additionally, there were 31 posters and 18 tips &amp; techniques submissions.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least six reviewers. This year, 56 papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. All posters and tips &amp; techniques submissions were also reviewed by two reviewers. 24 posters and nine Tips and Techniques submissions were accepted.The nine accepted working groups will address a diverse section of topics, including student engagement, game development, integrating international students, assessment development, code quality perceptions, a holistic understanding through research papers, effects of lecturer intervention on student behaviour, the Internet of Things and early developmental activities leading to computational thinking skills. Participating in a working group is probably one of the most efficient ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. It provides participants a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group.This conference will have two keynote speakers. Stefano Zacchiroli from the University of Paris, Diderot will present the Software Heritage project; its goals, challenges, and potential scholarly and educational uses. Sana Odeh will discuss her work in broadening participation in computer science in the Arab world. In particular, Dr. Odeh will present the achievements of her annual Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab world.In addition to the tradition conference banquet, which will be held at a traditional Italian trattoria, conference delegates will have the opportunity to explore Bologna's sights, smells, and tastes.We hope you will be intellectually challenged, gastronomically sated, and culturally fulfilled. Furthermore, our most fervent hope is that you will return home with new ideas to try in your classroom, and new friends and colleagues with whom you can collaborate.},

Originally designed for programmers, hackathons are now being appropriated by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons, we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these events. We conducted an interview study with 22 stakeholders - participants, representatives of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop. We conclude by reflecting on implications for the CHI community in carrying out philanthropic events styled after hackathons.},

But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceived by the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.},

abstract = {Hackathons are events where their participants face the challenge of working intensively and collaboratively with other people. In these events, the participants have the opportunity to develop functional prototypes and solutions to real problems in a short time period (one to three days). Those kind of events have become increasingly popular and spread to several fields of knowledge. Also, they have been adopted by many organizations over the world. However, there is little scientific data that explains why people have participated in hackathons. In this paper, we report findings from an exploratory study in two hackathons organized by a big IT company. We aim to understand why their participants have voluntarily participated in such events. We identified four sets of motivational factors: technical, social, individual and business motivations. Technical motivations are associated with skill acquisition, while social motivations are related to the interaction between people during the event. Also, individual motivations are associated with a sense of autonomy and enjoyment of work. Finally, business motivations include the opportunity of publicizing work and the possibility of establishing partnerships. Our findings contributes to a broader understanding of the motivations for participating in hackathons, as well as providing recommendations for the organization of such events.},

abstract = {Group facilitators often organize large co-located crowds into small groups where people can more effectively interact and learn from each other. However, current approaches for facilitating small group interactions typically do not capture data about the rapport and future potential of interacting groups. We introduce ProtoTeams, a system designed to facilitate and gather data from small group interactions by dynamically connecting people from larger co-located crowds, such as classrooms and hackathons, through personal mobile devices. The system randomly assigns subjects into groups, then guides them through short activities, at the end of which they evaluate their teammate preferences. We report preliminary results from three deployments in a university-level design studio course where students (N = 50) interact with peers on activities before forming teams for a quarter-long project. Results suggest that the system is intuitive and groups form efficiently. Few subjects report the environment being too hectic and activities too short to accurately evaluate their peers. Future studies will continue investigating the value of this tool in co-located team dynamics.},

abstract = {Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. While hackathons, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims, such as sprints, codefests, hack-days, edit-a-thons and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the software engineering activities of Siemens Healthineers that are related to education and learning. Our training activities have a long history and are done globally throughout the company. We expect that experience and lessons learned are useful for others. Our software engineering education activities range from onboarding of new employees to approaches for continuous learning for highly experienced professionals. We start already very early with training the "next generation" software engineers and focus on growing that talent throughout their career.We share here lessons learned that we have made over the past decades on this topic. This industrial experience report describes our approach by focusing on various "dimensions". The dimensions include the experience level, the content, and the format. Especially due to the Corona situation, we have held many trainings virtually and we share also our insights. Finally, we include three concrete examples of an aspect of our education and learning activities. These are on applying and conveying the agile mindset to learning to attract young talents, virtual hackathons and systematic link between training and job profiles.},

abstract = {Although monolithic applications are still the modus operandi of many software systems, the microservices architecture, which favors small and independent applications, is gaining increasing popularity. This is part due to its claimed benefits, which includes better scalability, productivity, and maintainability. However, little is known about how developers and architects perceive the benefits of migrating from monolithic applications to microservices, and what are the challenges towards achieving them. In this paper we discuss the motivation, benefits, and challenges related to the migration from monolithic enterprise architectures to a microservices based architecture. We report several lessons learned that arose from a two years process faced by three Brazilian Government Institutions. We also cross-validate these findings with a survey conducted with 13 practitioners in the studied companies. The results of our investigation highlight some evidence that the adoption of microservices brought several benefits for these institutions, such as (a) reducing development time and risks related to deployment activities and (b) increasing the opportunities to experiment with different technologies and development models (such as hackathons). However, our observations reveal that the adoption of microservices is still a challenging task, mainly because it not only demands the understanding of new techniques and tools, but it also increases the need to automate tasks related to software deployment and software monitoring. This study is particularly relevant for institutions interested in adopting a software architecture based on microservices, and we are currently sharing our experiences with other institutions.},

By appropriating core properties of hackathons, the Inventor Days brought together residents in a community and makers from across the city. Over three events, makers and community members worked together to learn about the local area, design novel ideas that addressed local issues and build prototypes. We show evidence that these events created enthusiasm around use of technology to support the community, while developing ongoing relationships that enabled members of the community to continue building on their experiences beyond the events. We propose this as a new means of enabling innovation in communities.},

abstract = {Context: Developer Relations (DevRel) is an organizational area responsible for maintaining synergy among developer communities and organizations. This team can be seen in companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, with a business model based on software ecosystems (SECO). A DevRel team has roles that perform specific activities (e.g., hackathons, developer programs) to achieve the organization’s goals and a better developer experience. Problem: The lack of clarity regarding the nature and set of skills needed by a DevRel professional can negatively impact the performance of related activities and consequently the purpose of SECO. Solution: We investigated a set of DevRel skills for education/training purposes. IS theory: This paper was generated from the perspective of the Theory of Organizational Creativity. This theory provides the key to understanding organizational effectiveness and survival. Method: We performed an opinion survey with 24 participants from ten countries. Results: The nature of DevRel’s professional skills is soft skills in which communication, willingness to learn, teamwork, interpersonal, and listening skills stand out. Hard skills have their share of contribution to DevRel activities and marketing and software programming/development skills stand out. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The main contribution of the paper is to make a product viable for any organization or individual to be able to develop the skills of a DevRel professional.

In this paper, we will present the result of a study to assess the impact of integrating co-curricular activities and practical skills into the undergraduate CS curriculum. More than 500 senior CS students were surveyed over a span of four semesters about their comfort level, use of practical skills, and their experience in a sophomore-level required course which was redesigned a few years ago. The new course introduced practical skills such as version control, SQL, command line tools, and web development as a way to better engage the students and prepare them for co-curricular computing experiences. Our data analysis provides insight about when and where students use practical skills, how students feel about co-curricular activities, and the positive impact of the course redesign on the overall student experience.},

abstract = {Software engineering for ‘social good’ is an area receiving growing interest in recent years. Software is increasingly seen as a way to promote positive social change: this includes initiatives such as Code for America and events such as hackathons, which strive to build innovative software solutions with a social conscience. From a software engineering perspective, existing software processes do not always match the needs of these social software projects, which are primarily aimed at social change and often involve vulnerable communities. In this paper, we argue for new software processes that combine elements of agile, iterative development with principles drawn from action research and participatory design. The former allow social software projects to be built quickly with limited resources; the latter allow for a proper understanding of the social context and vulnerable user groups. The paper describes Speedplay, a software development management framework integrating these approaches, and illustrates its use in a real social innovation case study.},

This paper aims to understand how CS undergraduate students develop their professional identity through analyzing students' reflection on their career goals, experiences in CS degree programs, and engagement in professional development. We present findings from qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with CS undergraduate students in the United States. We found that CS undergraduates form their computing professional identity typically between Years 2-3 of their degree programs. We identified several reasons students are committed to a computing profession: intrinsic factors (e.g., interest and perception of ability), and discipline-specific factors (e.g. utility and growth). We also found several factors that shape their professional identity: coursework, informal activities like hackathons, and professional development activities including internships and conferences. These findings suggest that the development of computing professional identity is not limited to students' involvement in the academic degree programs but the engagement they have with the broader computing community.},

In this paper, we discuss the structure of the CyberTeam and the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on its activities. The SWEETER CyberTeam has a hub-and-spoke structure that adopted a federated approach to ensure that each site maintained its own identity and was able to leverage local programs. It took a ”boots on the ground” approach that ensured that services were up and running in a short period of time. To ensure adequate coverage of all fields of science, the project adopted an inclusive fractional service approach that leveraged expertise at the participating sites. The Cyberteam has organized several workshops, hackathons, and training events. Team members have participated in completions and several follow-on programs have been funded. We present the achievements and learnings from this effort and discuss efforts to make it sustainable.},
