Title = {Automation of systematic literature reviews: A systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {136},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) studies aim to identify
   relevant primary papers, extract the required data, analyze, and
   synthesize results to gain further and broader insight into the
   investigated domain. Multiple SLR studies have been conducted in several
   domains, such as software engineering, medicine, and pharmacy.
   Conducting an SLR is a time-consuming, laborious, and costly effort. As
   such, several researchers developed different techniques to automate the
   SLR process. However, a systematic overview of the current
   state-of-the-art in SLR automation seems to be lacking.
   Objective: This study aims to collect and synthesize the studies that
   focus on the automation of SLR to pave the way for further research.
   Method: A systematic literature review is conducted on published primary
   studies on the automation of SLR studies, in which 41 primary studies
   have been analyzed. Results: This SLR identifies the objectives of
   automation studies, application domains, automated steps of the SLR,
   automation techniques, and challenges and solution directions.
   Conclusion: According to our study, the leading automated step is the
   Selection of Primary Studies. Although many studies have provided
   automation approaches for systematic literature reviews, no study has
   been found to apply automation techniques in the planning and reporting
   phase. Further research is needed to support the automation of the other
   activities of the SLR process.},

Title = {A comprehensive, semi-automated systematic literature review (SLR)
   design: Application to P-graph research with a focus on sustainability},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {415},
Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Because of the vast number of academic products with focus on
   sustainability being currently generated, it is becoming exceedingly
   difficult and time-consuming to perform accurate literature reviews that
   have actual relationship with such a topic and correctly reflect its
   state of the art. Thus, this work proposes a comprehensive Systematic
   Literature Review (SLR) design as a novel approach for collecting the
   body of contributions for any given research field in general and
   sustainability in particular. This design is guided by a semi-automated
   procedure that aims at incorporating the best automation features of
   earlier SLRs and involves available scientific databases, e.g., Scopus
   and Web of Science. The results of the proposed SLR design include
   bibliometric analyses, a list of researcher and institution networks,
   and a qualitative assessment of practical applications of the field of
   interest. Moreover, the proposed semi-automated approach allows for the
   inclusion of subject categorization based on the generation of
   author-density maps and keyword co-occurrence networks. For
   illustration, the semiautomated SLR design is implemented by thoroughly
   reviewing the contributions pertaining to the P-graph (Process Graph)
   framework with a focus on sustainability. The P-graph framework has been
   applied to multiple areas, such as network design, optimization, and
   system integration; in particular, the framework has proven to be useful
   for the development of sustainable systems. Upon execution, the
   semi-automated SLR design collected 284 contributions related to
   P-graph, of which 139 were classified as sustainability-related, and
   further partitioned into specific categories. It is expected that the
   proposed semi-automated SLR design will help researchers in the
   sustainability community accelerate the generation of works in that area
   by rapidly generating accurate literature reviews.},

Title = {The significant cost of systematic reviews and meta-analyses: A call for
   greater involvement of machine learning to assess the promise of
   clinical trials},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: More than 90\% of clinical-trial compounds fail to
   demonstrate sufficient efficacy and safety. To help alleviate this
   issue, systematic literature review and meta-analysis (SLR), which
   synthesize current evidence for a research question, can be applied to
   preclinical evidence to identify the most promising therapeutics.
   However, these methods remain time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here,
   we introduce an economic formula to estimate the expense of SLR for
   academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies.
   Methods: We estimate the manual effort involved in SLR by quantifying
   the amount of labor required and the total associated labor cost. We
   begin with an empirical estimation and derive a formula that quantifies
   and describes the cost.
   Results: The formula estimated that each SLR costs approximately
   \$141,194.80. We found that on average, the ten largest pharmaceutical
   companies publish 118.71 and the ten major academic institutions publish
   132.16 SLRs per year. On average, the total cost of all SLRs per year to
   each academic institution amounts to \$18,660,304.77 and for each
   pharmaceutical company is \$16,761,234.71.
   Discussion: It appears that SLR is an important, but costly mechanisms
   to assess the totality of evidence.
   Conclusions: With the increase in the number of publications, the
   significant time and cost of SLR may pose a barrier to their consistent
   application to assess the promise of clinical trials thoroughly. We call
   on investigators and developers to develop automated solutions to help
   with the assessment of preclinical evidence particularly. The formula we
   introduce provides a cost baseline against which the efficiency of
   automation can be measured.},

Title = {slr-kit: A semi-supervised machine learning framework for systematic
   literature reviews},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {251},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is nowadays a challenging task due to
   the large number of papers that typically compose the scientific
   material of the topic to review. Recently, a lot of research effort has
   been devoted to automate, even partially, the stages of an SLR. This
   paper proposes the design and implementation of a workflow and a set of
   tools - called slr-kit - to support key tasks in an SLR. The proposed
   approach leverages a semi-supervised strategy, in which time-consuming
   processes are carried out using automatic tools, whereas manual tasks
   have been optimized by carefully designed support tools to reduce the
   overall required effort. Important parts of the workflow include the
   extraction of key terms directly from the abstracts of the papers to
   survey, and the subsequent topic modeling that allows for a thematic
   clustering of the corpus of papers. In the proposed workflow, the former
   task is carried out by exploiting a novel tool, called FAst WOrd
   Classifier (FAWOC). The latter, instead, is designed to be automatically
   carried out by leveraging an ad-hoc solution based on the application of
   the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. The result of the
   process consists in a set of statistics regarding the relationship among
   papers, topics, and their trend of publication on journals and
   conference proceedings. The validity of the method is demonstrated with
   an application to a dataset related to the scientific field of NLP,
   while its accuracy is assessed by the manual examination of the results
   by domain experts. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Implementation and Critical Factors of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in
   Warehouse Management: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be a key solution for
   nearly automated or smart warehouse operations, enabling receiving,
   picking, storage, and shipping processes to be timely and more
   efficient. However, there is a relative scarcity of review studies
   specifically on UAV-based warehouse management. Research knowledge and
   insights on UAV applications in this field are also limited and could
   not sufficiently or practically support decision-making on commercial
   utilization. To leverage the potential applications and current
   situation of UAVs, this study provides a systematic literature review
   (SLR) on UAV adoption in warehouse management. SLR approach was
   critically conducted to identify, select, assess, and summarize
   findings, mainly on the two descriptive research questions; what are the
   past applications of UAV, and what are critical factors affecting UAV
   adoption in warehouse management? Five key critical factors and 13
   sub-factors could be observed. The results revealed that hardware (e.g.,
   payloads, battery power, and sensors) and software factors (e.g.,
   scheduling, path planning, localization, and navigation algorithms) are
   the most influential factors impacting drone adoption in warehouse
   management. The managerial implications of our research findings that
   guide decision-makers or practitioners to effectively employ UAV-based
   warehouse management in good practice are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Technology learning (TEL) continues to grow gradually while considering

   maturity assessment as a guideline for this gradual improvement. This
   study investigates the potential application of TEL's expert knowledge

   to analyze the qualitative data using systematic literature review (SLR)
   with automated content analysis (ACA) as quantitative data processing to
   strengthen the trustworthiness of the findings and reduce researcher
   bias. This process is carried out six steps: conducting SLR, data
   processing with ACA using Leximancer, organizing resulting concepts with
   facet analysis, contextualizing each TEL facet, constructing the
   assessment questionnaire for each context, and establishing TEL maturity
   dimensions. This study generates 64 questionnaire statements grouped
   according to the target respondents, namely students, teachers, or
   institutions. This set of questions is also grouped into dimensions
   representing aligned context: student performance, learning process,
   applied technology, contents, accessibility, teachers and teachings,
   strategy and regulation. Further research is required to distribute this

   Review},

Abstract = {The use of mobile devices is rising daily in this technological era. A
   continuous and increasing number of mobile applications are constantly
   offered on mobile marketplaces to fulfil the needs of smartphone users.
   Many Android applications do not address the security aspects
   appropriately. This is often due to a lack of automated mechanisms to
   identify, test, and fix source code vulnerabilities at the early stages
   of design and development. Therefore, the need to fix such issues at the
   initial stages rather than providing updates and patches to the
   published applications is widely recognized. Researchers have proposed
   several methods to improve the security of applications by detecting
   source code vulnerabilities and malicious codes. This Systematic
   Literature Review (SLR) focuses on Android application analysis and
   source code vulnerability detection methods and tools by critically
   evaluating 118 carefully selected technical studies published between
   2016 and 2022. It highlights the advantages, disadvantages,
   applicability of the proposed techniques, and potential improvements of
   those studies. Both Machine Learning (ML)-based methods and conventional
   methods related to vulnerability detection are discussed while focusing
   more on ML-based methods, since many recent studies conducted
   experiments with ML. Therefore, this article aims to enable researchers
   to acquire in-depth knowledge in secure mobile application development
   while minimizing the vulnerabilities by applying ML methods.
   Furthermore, researchers can use the discussions and findings of this
   SLR to identify potential future research and development directions.},

Title = {An intelligent literature review: adopting inductive approach to define
   machine learning applications in the clinical domain},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIG DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Big data analytics utilizes different techniques to transform large
   volumes of big datasets. The analytics techniques utilize various
   computational methods such as Machine Learning (ML) for converting raw
   data into valuable insights. The ML assists individuals in performing
   work activities intelligently, which empowers decision-makers. Since
   academics and industry practitioners have growing interests in ML,
   various existing review studies have explored different applications of
   ML for enhancing knowledge about specific problem domains. However, in
   most of the cases existing studies suffer from the limitations of
   employing a holistic, automated approach. While several researchers
   developed various techniques to automate the systematic literature
   review process, they also seemed to lack transparency and guidance for
   future researchers. This research aims to promote the utilization of
   intelligent literature reviews for researchers by introducing a
   step-by-step automated framework. We offer an intelligent literature
   review to obtain in-depth analytical insight of ML applications in the
   clinical domain to (a) develop the intelligent literature framework
   using traditional literature and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic
   modeling, (b) analyze research documents using traditional systematic
   literature review revealing ML applications, and (c) identify topics
   from documents using LDA topic modeling. We used a PRISMA framework for
   the review to harness samples sourced from four major databases (e.g.,
   IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) published between 2016 and
   2021 (September). The framework comprises two stages-(a) traditional
   systematic literature review consisting of three stages (planning,
   conducting, and reporting) and (b) LDA topic modeling that consists of
   three steps (pre-processing, topic modeling, and post-processing). The
   intelligent literature review framework transparently and reliably
   reviewed 305 sample documents.},

Title = {Service chatbots: A systematic review},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {184},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Chatbots or Conversational agents are the next significant technological
   leap in the field of conversational services, that is, enabling a device
   to communicate with a user upon receiving user requests in natural
   language. The device uses artificial intelligence and machine learning
   to respond to the user with automated responses. While this is a
   relatively new area of study, the application of this concept has
   increased substantially over the last few years. The technology is no
   longer limited to merely emulating human conversation but is also being
   increasingly used to answer questions, either in academic environments
   or in commercial uses, such as situations requiring assistants to seek
   reasons for customer dissatisfaction or recommending products and
   services. The primary purpose of this literature review is to identify
   and study the existing literature on cutting-edge technology in
   developing chatbots in terms of research trends, their components and
   techniques, datasets and domains used, as well as evaluation metrics
   most used between 2011 and 2020. Using the standard SLR guidelines
   designed by Kitchenham, this work adopts a systematic literature review
   approach and utilizes five prestigious scientific databases for
   identifying, extracting, and analyzing all relevant publications during
   the search. The related publications were filtered based on
   inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment to obtain the final
   review paper. The results of the review indicate that the exploitation
   of deep learning and reinforcement learning architecture is the most
   used technique to understand users' requests and to generate appropriate
   responses. Besides, we also found that the Twitter dataset (open domain)
   is the most popular dataset used for evaluation, followed by Airline
   Travel Information Systems (ATIS) (close domain) and Ubuntu Dialog
   Corpora (technical support) datasets. The SLR review also indicates that
   the open domain provided by the Twitter dataset, airline and technical
   support are the most common domains for chatbots. Moreover, the metrics
   utilized most often for evaluating chatbot performance (in descending
   order of popularity) were found to be accuracy, F1-Score, BLEU
   (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), recall, human-evaluation, and
   precision.},

Title = {Large Scale Identification and Categorization of Protein Sequences Using
   Structured Logistic Regression},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Background: Structured Logistic Regression (SLR) is a newly developed
   machine learning tool first proposed in the context of text
   categorization. Current availability of extensive protein sequence
   databases calls for an automated method to reliably classify sequences
   and SLR seems well-suited for this task. The classification of P-type
   ATPases, a large family of ATP-driven membrane pumps transporting
   essential cations, was selected as a test-case that would generate
   important biological information as well as provide a proof-of-concept
   for the application of SLR to a large scale bioinformatics problem.
   Results: Using SLR, we have built classifiers to identify and
   automatically categorize P-type ATPases into one of 11 pre-defined
   classes. The SLR-classifiers are compared to a Hidden Markov Model
   approach and shown to be highly accurate and scalable. Representing the
   bulk of currently known sequences, we analysed 9.3 million sequences in
   the UniProtKB and attempted to classify a large number of P-type
   ATPases. To examine the distribution of pumps on organisms, we also
   applied SLR to 1,123 complete genomes from the Entrez genome database.
   Finally, we analysed the predicted membrane topology of the identified
   P-type ATPases.
   Conclusions: Using the SLR-based classification tool we are able to run
   a large scale study of P-type ATPases. This study provides
   proof-of-concept for the application of SLR to a bioinformatics problem
   and the analysis of P-type ATPases pinpoints new and interesting targets
   for further biochemical characterization and structural analysis.},

Title = {Smart Contracts in the Construction Industry: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {On-time delivery of documentation and contracts has been recognized as a
   crucial requirement for the successful delivery of projects. However,
   the construction industry still depends on time-consuming traditional
   contract processes, which negatively affect the overall productivity of
   projects in the industry. The use of Smart Contracts (SCs) is
   highlighted as a suitable novel technology to expedite the contract
   processes and establish a reliable payment environment in the
   construction industry. Whilst there has been an increase in the debate
   about the use of SCs in construction in recent years, their use in
   practice still seems to be in its infancy. As such, the topic will
   benefit from a thorough review of benefits, drivers, barriers and
   strategies that can enhance the implementation of SCs in construction.
   This article presents the key findings from a Systematic Literature
   Review (SLR) on SCs in the construction industry, critically assessing
   existing studies on the topic. The study initially involved 171 research
   papers for the SLR process, and out of that 49 research papers were
   filtered for further analysis after reading their abstracts. A total of
   30 papers were finally filtered after the full-text reading for the SLR.
   Descriptive and content analysis were used to analyse the full-text
   findings. The study graphically mapped the bibliographic materials by
   using the Visualization of Similarities (VoS) Viewer software. As per
   the findings, the topic has mostly been researched in Asia and the
   Pacific as a region and China as a country. It was noted that there were
   more empirical articles than theoretical studies related to SCs,
   evidencing the industry relevance of the issue. A total of 55\% of the
   articles reviewed have been published in journals with a Q1 ranking. All
   the articles were written by multiple authors, with 30\% of the journal
   articles having international co-authors and benefitting from the
   collaboration between authors. Key advantages identified in the
   literature go beyond contract and payment provisions and include aspects
   such as logistic handling, decentralized applications, business process
   management, automated payments, etc. Key drivers for adoption are supply
   chain pressure, competitive pressure, top management support, simple
   layout, reduction in risks of clients, clarity in responsibility and
   risk allocation, whereas the key barriers include insecurity, limited
   observability, incompatibility, inactive government collaboration and
   limited storage capacity. Key strategies to enhance the application of
   SC in construction include integrating theorems proving symbolic
   execution, using the selective transparency method and lock fund system,
   testing the integration of SCs with other systems at the initial stage,
   incorporating semi-automated consensus mechanisms for payments,
   constructing a mechanism to actively engage with government bodies, etc.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 11},
Abstract = {Driven by promises of better and quicker decision-making, research on
   applications of technologies such as artificial intelligence in
   automating management decisions is increasing. However, the factors
   influencing the decision to increase the level of automation of a given
   management decision have remained a sidenote in the literature. In this
   systematic literature review, we organize these factors from the
   fragmented and heterogeneous research landscape concerned with
   automating management decisions. Using a systematically derived sample
   of research, we categorize and distill a multitude of factors into four
   themes: goals, foundations, design considerations, and application. We
   propose positive influences of six factors and a negative influence of
   one, namely costs, on the decision to increase the level of automation
   of a management decision. Finally, based on these propositions, we
   derive an agenda to guide future research.},

Abstract = {Model refactoring enhances the platform-independent design models of
   software aiming at smoother impact of requirement changes, thereby
   improving the design quality and assisting in their evolution and
   maintenance. This study reports a systematic literature review of
   refactoring techniques particularly in the domain of models of
   object-oriented software systems. The study used the standard systematic
   literature review method based on a comprehensive set of 58 articles
   from a total of 1200 articles published in leading journals, premier
   conferences, workshops and books. The primary studies were thoroughly
   analyzed on various aspects of model refactoring process. Identification
   of methodologies and classification on the basis of model transformation
   systems, refactoring operations and their application, model behavior
   specification and preservation, model quality expression, model
   consistency management and automation of process is reported. This study
   shows that inadequate model-based approaches for behavior preservation,
   synchronized model enhancement and empirical evaluation of the proposed
   refactoring techniques are major obstacles in fully automated model
   refactoring process.},

Abstract = {Gateways in the Internet of Things (IoT) play a decisive role in routing
   the preprocessed filtered data to cloud platforms. While investigating
   gateways, the need for a comprehensive systematic literature review that
   can elaborate the working and functionalities of IoT gateways was felt.
   This paper presents a systematic literature review of IoT gateways in
   general and smart gateways in particular. It considered papers published
   over the last 10 years, i.e., from 2011 till July 2021. A methodical
   literature analysis technique is used in this review; out of 2347
   papers, 67 articles are selected for complete analysis based on
   well-defined criteria. The survey starts with the broad categorization
   of gateways in IoT as basic and smart gateways. Further, smart gateways
   are sub-divided into three categories as passive gateways,
   semi-automated and fully-automated gateways. The survey is performed
   based on well-defined criteria, which include: the type of gateways,
   their requirements, tools/platforms, the approach adopted, evaluation
   and their application domain. This paper demonstrates further
   bifurcation of functional requirements of IoT gateways. Research gaps
   and open issues have been identified in the area. Future prospects have
   accordingly being suggested to help academicians embark on advanced
   research. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

Title = {State of the art of automatic disassembly of WEEE and perspective
   towards intelligent recycling in the era of Industry 4.0},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 17},
Abstract = {Disassembly of e-waste has received significant attention over the past
   decades to extract value-added parts or components for recovery or
   reuse. It is imperative to develop automatic disassembly to replace
   human workers thus safeguarding them against the hazardous environment.
   Most scholars investigate the disassembly of e-waste from a technical
   perspective on laboratory scale. Few types of research related to its
   development track and scaled application are completed. This paper
   attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the disassembly of Waste
   Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) in a strategic perspective
   from manual operation, (semi)-automation to intelligent disassembly
   through a systematic literature review. The main barriers to automating
   the recycling industry lie in the high complexity and uncertainty of
   end-of-life (EOL) products that perplex the automatic handling and
   planning. Intelligent systems integrated in cognitive robots are helpful
   to handle the uncertainty through learning and revision processes. This
   work has three objectives: first, to map out what research has been
   carried out in the field of WEEE disassembly and the necessity for
   disassembly automation; second, to conduct a systematic literature
   review for the state of the art of automatic disassembly and discuss the
   barriers to its industrial application; third, to propose a perspective
   for integrating Industry 4.0 technologies with disassembly automation to
   promote flexibility and efficiency, providing a new scheme for future
   treatment of WEEE.},

Title = {The use of Artificial intelligence in school science: a systematic
   literature review},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL MEDIA INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 6},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence is widely used across contexts and for different
   purposes, including the field of education. However, a review of the
   literature showcases that while there exist various review studies on
   the use of AI in education, missing remains a review focusing on science
   education. To address this gap, we carried out a systematic literature
   review between 2010 and 2021, driven by three questions: a) What types
   of AI applications are used in school science? b) For what teaching
   content are AI applications in school science used? and, c) What is the
   impact of AI applications on teaching and learning of school science?
   The studies reviewed (n = 22) included nine different types of AI
   applications: automated assessment, automated feedback, learning
   analytics, adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring systems,
   multilabel text classification, chatbot, expert systems, and mind
   wandering detection. The majority of the AI applications are used in
   geoscience or physicsand AI applications are used to support either
   knkowledge construction or skills development. In terms of the impact of
   AI applications, this is found across the following: learning
   achievement, argumentation skills, learning experience, and teaching.
   Missing remains an examination of learners' and teachers' experiences
   with the use of AI in school science, interdisciplinary approaches to AI
   implementation, as well as an examination of issues related to ethics
   and biases.},

Title = {The Applicability of Automated Testing Frameworks for Mobile Application
   Testing: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Mobile applications are developed and released to the market every day.
   Due to the intense usage of mobile applications, their quality matters.
   End users' rejection of mobile apps increases from time to time due to
   their low quality and lack of proper mobile testing. This indicates that
   the role of mobile application testing is crucial in the acceptance of a
   given software product. Test engineers use automation frameworks for
   testing their mobile applications. Automated testing brings several
   advantages to the development team. For example, automated checks are
   used for regression testing, fast execution of test scripts, and
   providing quick feedback for the development team. A systematic
   literature review has been used to identify and collect evidence on
   automated testing frameworks for mobile application testing. A total of
   56 relevant research papers were identified that were published in
   prominent journals and conferences until February 2023. The results were
   summarized and tabulated to provide insights into the suitability of the
   existing automation testing framework for mobile application testing. We
   identified the major test concerns and test challenges in performing
   mobile automation testing. The results showed that the keyword-driven
   testing framework is the widely used approach, but recently, hybrid
   approaches have been adopted for mobile test automation. On the other
   hand, this review indicated that the existing frameworks need to be
   customized using reusable and domain-specific keywords to make them
   suitable for mobile application testing. Considering this, this study
   proposes an architecture, the mobile-based automation testing framework
   (MATF). In the future, to address the mobile application testing
   challenges, the authors will work on implementing the proposed framework
   (MATF).},

Title = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Integration with Digital Technologies
   toward Construction 4.0: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in the construction
   industry in the last decade for various purposes such as progress
   monitoring and building inspection. Recently, there has been a rising
   trend of employing UAVs with other digital technologies (DTs), such as
   Building Information Modeling and Extended Reality. The integration of
   these technologies encourages automation and digitization toward better
   project performance. However, little is known about the implementation
   of UAVs in conjunction with other DTs. Therefore, this study performs a
   systematic literature review to determine application areas and
   technology trends regarding UAVs' integration with other DTs. The search
   yielded 287 articles, of which 36 satisfied the established inclusion
   criteria and formed the foundation of this systematic review. Seven
   application areas of UAV integration with other DTs were identified:
   progress monitoring, historic building conservation, information
   management, construction safety, construction education, structural and
   infrastructure inspection, and transportation. This study also revealed
   UAV technology trends encouraging automation and digitization: automated
   progress monitoring, automated UAV inspection planning, real-time video
   streaming, and parametric model development of historicbuildings. This
   study is expected to be a starting point of future in-depth research by
   providing a general understanding of the current applications of UAVs
   integration with other DTs.},

Abstract = {Differential diagnosis of parkinsonism early upon symptom onset is often
   challenging for clinicians and stressful for patients. Several
   neuroimaging methods have been previously evaluated; however specific
   routines remain to be established. The aim of this study was to
   systematically assess the diagnostic accuracy of a previously developed
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) based
   automated algorithm in the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes,
   including unpublished data from a prospective cohort. A series of 35
   patients prospectively recruited in a movement disorder clinic in
   Stockholm were assessed, followed by systematic literature review and
   meta-analysis. In our cohort, automated image-based classification
   method showed excellent sensitivity and specificity for Parkinson
   Disease (PD) vs. atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS), in line with the
   results of the meta-analysis (pooled sensitivity and specificity 0.84;
   95\% CI 0.79-0.88 and 0.96; 95\% CI 0.91 -0.98, respectively). In
   conclusion, FDG-PET automated analysis has an excellent potential to
   distinguish between PD and APS early in the disease course and may be a
   valuable tool in clinical routine as well as in research applications.},

Title = {Personal touch in digital customer service: a conceptual framework of
   relational personalization for conversational AI},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SERVICE THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 16},
Abstract = {PurposeCustomer service conversations are becoming increasingly digital
   and automated, leaving service encounters impersonal. The purpose of
   this paper is to identify how customer service agents and conversational
   artificial intelligence (AI) applications can provide a personal touch
   and improve the customer experience in customer service. The authors
   offer a conceptual framework delineating how text-based customer service
   communication should be designed to increase relational
   personalization.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a
   systematic literature review on conversation styles of conversational AI
   and integrates the extant research to inform the development of the
   proposed conceptual framework. Using social information processing
   theory as a theoretical lens, the authors extend the concept of
   relational personalization for text-based customer service
   communication.FindingsThe conceptual framework identifies conversation
   styles, whose degree of expression needs to be personalized to provide a
   personal touch and improve the customer experience in service. The
   personalization of these conversation styles depends on available
   psychological and individual customer knowledge, contextual factors such
   as the interaction and service type, as well as the freedom of
   communication the conversational AI or customer service agent
   has.Originality/valueThe article is the first to conduct a systematic
   literature review on conversation styles of conversational AI in
   customer service and to conceptualize critical elements of text-based
   customer service communication required to provide a personal touch with
   conversational AI. Furthermore, the authors provide managerial
   implications to advance customer service conversations with three types
   of conversational AI applications used in collaboration with customer
   service agents, namely conversational analytics, conversational coaching
   and chatbots.},

Title = {Blockchain-Based Reference Architecture for Automated, Transparent, and
   Notarized Attestation of Compliance Adaptations},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Featured Application This paper presents an approach to using blockchain
   technology to configure automated, transparent, and cryptographically
   signed cloud applications. With cloud computing, organizations must
   comply with applicable laws, policies, and best practices. Companies
   typically rely on cloud service providers to implement and adopt
   regulations. This consulting phase is often time-consuming, costly, and
   not transparent. Organizations must trust the third party's
   implementation and associated documentation processes. To resolve this
   dilemma, we present a blockchain-based reference architecture for the
   automated, transparent, and notarized attestation of such compliance
   adaptations. Before proposing a solution, our approach is to understand
   the underlying research context. We conduct a machine-learning-supported
   systematic literature review to create a knowledge base. A reference
   architecture, including a prototype for configuring intrusion-detection
   systems, is developed using design science research. A
   mixed-methods-based approach is used for the evaluation of the proposed
   architecture. A quantitative survey is then used to show that the user
   experience of the developed prototype can be rated as positive, with an
   average value of 0.7. Finally, two focus group discussions are used to
   analyze the presented prototype qualitatively. As a result, we
   demonstrate how to actively support secure and trustworthy communication
   between a cloud service provider and an organization applying blockchain
   configurations.},

Abstract = {Knowledge extraction through machine learning techniques has been
   successfully applied in a large number of application domains. However,
   apart from the required technical knowledge and background in the
   application domain, it usually involves a number of time-consuming and
   repetitive steps. Automated machine learning (AutoML) emerged in 2014 as
   an attempt to mitigate these issues, making machine learning methods
   more practicable to both data scientists and domain experts. AutoML is a
   broad area encompassing a wide range of approaches aimed at addressing a
   diversity of tasks over the different phases of the knowledge discovery
   process being automated with specific techniques. To provide a big
   picture of the whole area, we have conducted a systematic literature
   review based on a proposed taxonomy that permits categorising 447
   primary studies selected from a search of 31,048 papers. This review
   performs an extensive and rigorous analysis of the AutoML field,
   scrutinising how the primary studies have addressed the dimensions of
   the taxonomy, and identifying any gaps that remain unexplored as well as
   potential future trends. The analysis of these studies has yielded some
   intriguing findings. For instance, we have observed a significant growth
   in the number of publications since 2018. Additionally, it is noteworthy
   that the algorithm selection problem has gradually been superseded by
   the challenge of workflow composition, which automates more than one
   phase of the knowledge discovery process simultaneously. Of all the
   tasks in AutoML, the growth of neural architecture search is
   particularly noticeable.},

Title = {Empirical Studies on Usability of mHealth Apps: A Systematic Literature
   Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The release of smartphones and tablets, which offer more advanced
   communication and computing capabilities, has led to the strong
   emergence of mHealth on the market. mHealth systems are being used to
   improve patients' lives and their health, in addition to facilitating
   communication between doctors and patients. Researchers are now
   proposing mHealth applications for many health conditions such as
   dementia, autism, dysarthria, Parkinson's disease, and so on. Usability
   becomes a key factor in the adoption of these applications, which are
   often used by people who have problems when using mobile devices and who
   have a limited experience of technology. The aim of this paper is to
   investigate the empirical usability evaluation processes described in a
   total of 22 selected studies related to mHealth applications by means of
   a Systematic Literature Review. Our results show that the empirical
   evaluation methods employed as regards usability could be improved by
   the adoption of automated mechanisms. The evaluation processes should
   also be revised to combine more than one method. This paper will help
   researchers and developers to create more usable applications. Our study
   demonstrates the importance of adapting health applications to users'
   need.},

Abstract = {The position or movement control of an automated guided vehicle (AGV) is
   crucial for its operation. However, choosing the AGV position sensor is
   not a trivial task. This paper investigates the sensors and sensing
   techniques in machine vision applied in AGV position control in the past
   5 years of published academic research. Using a systematic literature
   review method, we seek to answer the main research question: which
   sensors and sensing techniques are used in indoor AGV positioning
   control problems according to the past 5 years of published research and
   their technological impact. In doing so, we address three sub-question:
   (i) is the sensor/sensing technique related to the AGV application area;
   (ii) is the sensor/sensing technique applied to the problem related to
   the control strategy and/or the AGV guide; (iii) is the sensor/sensing
   technique related to the required AGV accuracy/sensitivity level. The
   paper contributions are the application of a systematic method of
   literature review in AGV position sensors, the research area overview
   from the selected 31 articles of the past 5 years, and a research agenda
   proposal.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used for processing data to make
   decisions, Interact with humans, and understand their feelings and
   emotions. With the advent of the Internet, people share and express
   their thoughts on day-to-day activities and global and local events
   through text messaging applications. Hence, it is essential for machines
   to understand emotions in opinions, feedback, and textual dialogues to
   provide emotionally aware responses to users in today's online world.
   The field of text-based emotion detection (TBED) is advancing to provide
   automated solutions to various applications, such as business and
   finance, to name a few. TBED has gained a lot of attention in recent
   times. The paper presents a systematic literature review of the existing
   literature published between 2005 and 2021 in TBED. This review has
   meticulously examined 63 research papers from the IEEE, Science Direct,
   Scopus, and Web of Science databases to address four primary research
   questions. It also reviews the different applications of TBED across
   various research domains and highlights its use. An overview of various
   emotion models, techniques, feature extraction methods, datasets, and
   research challenges with future directions has also been represented.},

Title = {The experimental applications of search-based techniques for model-based
   testing: Taxonomy and systematic literature review},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Context: Model-based testing (MBT) aims to generate executable test
   cases from behavioral models of software systems. MBT gains interest in
   industry and academia due to its provision of systematic, automated, and
   comprehensive testing. Researchers have successfully applied
   search-based techniques (SBTs) by automating the search for an optimal
   set of test cases at reasonable cost compared to other more expensive
   techniques. Thus, there is a recent surge toward the applications of
   SBTs for MBT because the generated test cases are optimal and have low
   computational cost. However, successful, future SBTs for MBT
   applications demand deep insight into its existing experimental
   applications that underlines stringent issues and challenges, which is
   lacking in the literature.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to comprehensively analyze the
   current state-of-the-art of the experimental applications of SBTs for
   MBT and present the limitations of the current literature to direct
   future research.
   Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using 72
   experimental papers from six data sources. We proposed a taxonomy based
   on the literature to categorize the characteristics of the current
   applications.
   Results: The results indicate that the majority of the existing
   applications of SBTs for MBT focus on functional and structural coverage
   purposes, as opposed to stress testing, regression testing and graphical
   user interface (GUI) testing. We found research gaps in the existing
   applications in five areas: applying multi-objective SBTs, proposing
   hybrid techniques, handling complex constraints, addressing data and
   requirement-based adequacy criteria, and adapting landscape
   visualization. Only twelve studies proposed and empirically evaluated
   the SBTs for complex systems in MBT.
   Conclusion: This extensive systematic analysis of the existing
   literature based on the proposed taxonomy enables to assist researchers
   in exploring the existing research efforts and reveal the limitations
   that need additional investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Smart manufacturing supported by emerging Industry 4.0 technologies is a
   key driver to realize mass product customizations. Augmented reality
   (AR) has been commonly applied to facilitate manual operations with
   ambient intelligence by overlaying virtual information on physical
   scenes. In most modern factories, maintenance remains an indispensable
   process that is difficult or yet to be fully automated. Several studies
   have previously reviewed AR-based maintenance across all industrial
   sectors, whereas those specific to manufacturing did not necessarily
   involve maintenance. Hence, this paper presents a systematic literature
   review on AR-assisted maintenance in manufacturing with a focus on the
   operator's needs. A generic process has been proposed to classify the
   maintenance operations examined in the past studies into four sequential
   steps and to analyze the classification results based on the
   geographical location, maintenance type, AR technical elements, and
   integrated external sensors. The findings thus derived are expected to
   provide design guidelines for implementing AR applications with
   practical values to aid manual maintenance in future smart manufacturing
   environments.},

Abstract = {Airway disease is a major healthcare issue that causes at least 3
   million fatalities every year. It is also considered one of the foremost
   causes of death all around the globe by 2030. Numerous studies have been
   undertaken to demonstrate the latest advances in artificial intelligence
   algorithms to assist in identifying and classifying these diseases. This
   comprehensive review aims to summarise the state-of-the-art machine and
   deep learning-based systems for detecting airway disorders, envisage the
   trends of the recent work in this domain, and analyze the difficulties
   and potential future paths. This systematic literature review includes
   the study of one hundred fifty-five articles on airway diseases such as
   cystic fibrosis, emphysema, lung cancer, Mesothelioma, covid-19,
   pneumoconiosis, asthma, pulmonary edema, tuberculosis, pulmonary
   embolism as well as highlights the automated learning techniques to
   predict them. The study concludes with a discussion and challenges about
   expanding the efficiency and machine and deep learning-assisted airway
   disease detection applications.},

   review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The processes used to develop software need to comply with normative
   requirements (e.g., standards and regulations) to align with the market
   and the law. Manual compliance checking is challenging because there are
   numerous requirements with changing nature and different purposes.
   Despite the importance of automated techniques, there is not any
   systematic study in this field. This lack may hinder organizations from
   moving toward automated compliance checking practices. In this paper, we
   characterize the methods for automatic compliance checking of software
   processes, including used techniques, potential impacts, and challenges.
   For this, we undertake a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies
   reporting methods in this field. As a result, we identify solutions that
   use different techniques (e.g., anthologies and metamodels) to represent
   processes and their artifacts (e.g., tasks and roles). Various
   languages, which have diverse capabilities for managing competing and
   changing norms, and agile strategies, are also used to represent
   normative requirements. Most solutions require tool-support
   concretization and enhanced capabilities to handle processes and
   normative diversity. Our findings outline compelling areas for future
   research. In particular, there is a need to select suitable languages
   for consolidating a generic and normative-agnostic solution, increase
   automation levels, tool support, and boost the application in practice
   by improving usability aspects.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Terms of
   Different Application Domains and Tasks},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have recently
   been radically improved and are now being employed in almost every
   application domain to develop automated or semi-automated systems. To
   facilitate greater human acceptability of these systems, explainable
   artificial intelligence (XAI) has experienced significant growth over
   the last couple of years with the development of highly accurate models
   but with a paucity of explainability and interpretability. The
   literature shows evidence from numerous studies on the philosophy and
   methodologies of XAI. Nonetheless, there is an evident scarcity of
   secondary studies in connection with the application domains and tasks,
   let alone review studies following prescribed guidelines, that can
   enable researchers' understanding of the current trends in XAI, which
   could lead to future research for domain- and application-specific
   method development. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic
   literature review (SLR) on the recent developments of XAI methods and
   evaluation metrics concerning different application domains and tasks.
   This study considers 137 articles published in recent years and
   identified through the prominent bibliographic databases. This
   systematic synthesis of research articles resulted in several analytical
   findings: XAI methods are mostly developed for safety-critical domains
   worldwide, deep learning and ensemble models are being exploited more
   than other types of AI/ML models, visual explanations are more
   acceptable to end-users and robust evaluation metrics are being
   developed to assess the quality of explanations. Research studies have
   been performed on the addition of explanations to widely used AI/ML
   models for expert users. However, more attention is required to generate
   explanations for general users from sensitive domains such as finance
   and the judicial system.},

Abstract = {An increasingly popular set of techniques adopted by software
   engineering (SE) researchers to automate development tasks are those
   rooted in the concept of Deep Learning (DL). The popularity of such
   techniques largely stems from their automated feature engineering
   capabilities, which aid in modeling software artifacts. However, due to
   the rapid pace at which DL techniques have been adopted, it is difficult
   to distill the current successes, failures, and opportunities of the
   current research landscape. In an effort to bring clarity to this
   cross-cutting area of work, from its modern inception to the present,
   this article presents a systematic literature review of research at the
   intersection of SE \& DL. The review canvasses work appearing in the
   most prominent SE and DL conferences and journals and spans 128 papers
   across 23 unique SE tasks. We center our analysis around the components
   of learning, a set of principles that governs the application of machine
   learning techniques (ML) to a given problem domain, discussing several
   aspects of the surveyed work at a granular level. The end result of our
   analysis is a research roadmap that both delineates the foundations of
   DL techniques applied to SE research and highlights likely areas of
   fertile exploration for the future.},

Title = {Systematic analysis of automated threat modelling techniques: Comparison
   of open-source tools},
Journal = {SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 25},
Abstract = {Companies face increasing pressure to protect themselves and their
   customers from security threats. Security by design is a proactive
   approach that builds security into all aspects of a system from the
   ground up, rather than adding it on as an afterthought. By taking
   security into account at every stage of development, organizations can
   create systems that are more resistant to attacks and better able to
   recover from them if they do occur. One of the most relevant practices
   is threat modelling, i.e. the process of identifying and analysing the
   security threat to an information system, application, or network. These
   processes require security experts with high skills to anticipate
   possible issues: therefore, it is a costly task and requires a lot of
   time. To face these problems, many different automated threat modelling
   methodologies are emerging. This paper first carries out a systematic
   literature review (SLR) aimed at both having an overview of the
   automated threat modelling techniques used in literature and enumerating
   all the tools that implement these techniques. Then, an analysis was
   carried out considering four open-source tools and a comparison with our
   threat modelling approach using a simple, but significant case study: an
   e-commerce site developed on top of WordPress.},

Abstract = {Blockchain is a platform of distributed elaboration, which allows users
   to provide software for a huge range of next-generation decentralized
   applications without involving reliable third parties. Smart contracts
   (SCs) are an important component in blockchain applications: they are
   programmatic agreements among two or more parties that cannot be
   rescinded. Furthermore, SCs have an important characteristic: they allow
   users to implement reliable transactions without involving third
   parties. However, the advantages of SCs have a price. Like any program,
   SCs can contain bugs, some of which may also constitute security
   threats. Writing correct and secure SCs can be extremely difficult
   because, once deployed, they cannot be modified. Although SCs have been
   recently introduced, a large number of approaches have been proposed to
   find bugs and vulnerabilities in SCs. In this article, we present a
   systematic literature review on the approaches for the automated
   detection of bugs and vulnerabilities in SCs. We survey 68 papers
   published between 2015 and 2020, and we annotate each paper according to
   our classification framework to provide quantitative results and find
   possible areas not explored yet. Finally, we identify the open problems
   in this research field to provide possible directions to future
   researchers.},

Title = {Applications of computer vision and machine learning techniques for
   digitized herbarium specimens: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Herbaria contain the treasure of millions of specimens that have been
   preserved for several years for scientific studies. To increase the rate
   of scientific discoveries, digitization of these specimens is currently
   ongoing to facilitate the easy access and sharing of data to a wider
   scientific community. Online digital repositories such as Integrated
   Digitized Biocollection and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
   have already accumulated millions of specimen images yet to be explored.
   This presents the perfect time to take advantage of the opportunity to
   automate the identification process and increase the rate of novel
   discoveries using computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML)
   techniques. In this study, a systematic literature review of more than
   70 peer-reviewed publications was conducted focusing on the application
   of computer vision and machine learning techniques to digitized
   herbarium specimens. The study categorizes the different techniques and
   applications that are commonly used for digitized herbarium specimens
   and highlights existing challenges together with their potential
   solutions. We hope this study will serve as a firm foundation for new
   researchers in the relevant disciplines and will also be enlightening to
   both computer science and ecology experts.},

Abstract = {The educational sector can be enriched by the incorporation of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in various aspects. The field of artificial
   intelligence and its applications in the education sector give rise to a
   multidisciplinary field that brings together computer science,
   statistics, psychology and, of course, education. Within this context,
   this review aimed to synthesise existing research focused on provide
   improvements on primary/ secondary student assessment using some AI
   tool. Thus, nine original research studies (641 participants), published
   between 2010 and 2023, met the inclusion criteria defined in this
   systematic literature review. The main contributions of the application
   of AI in the assessment of students at these lower educational levels
   focus on predicting their performance, automating and making evaluations
   more objective by means of neural networks or natural language
   processing, the use of educational robots to analyse their learning
   process, and the detection of specific factors that make classes more
   attractive. This review shows the possibilities and already existing
   uses that AI can bring to education, specifically in the evaluation of
   student performance at the primary and secondary levels. (c) 2023

   Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The increasing interconnections of city services, the explosion of
   available urban data, and the need for multidisciplinary analysis and
   decision making for city sustainability require new technological
   solutions to cope with such complexity. Ontologies have become viable
   and effective tools to practitioners for developing applications
   requiring data and process interoperability, big data management, and
   automated reasoning on knowledge. We investigate how and to what extent
   ontologies have been used to support smart city services and we provide
   a comprehensive reference on what problems have been addressed and what
   has been achieved so far with ontology-based applications. To this
   purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review finalized to
   presenting the ontologies, and the methods and technological systems
   where ontologies play a relevant role in shaping current smart cities.
   Based on the result of the review process, we also propose a
   classification of the sub-domains of the city addressed by the
   ontologies we found, and the research issues that have been considered
   so far by the scientific community. We highlight those for which
   semantic technologies have been mostly demonstrated to be effective to
   enhance the smart city concept and, finally, discuss in more details
   about some open problems.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Construction site safety is a vital issue in construction project
   management. Real-time locating and tracking technologies are getting
   widely used for automated monitoring of the location and direction of
   onsite resources, specifically workers and equipment in order to prevent
   hazard exposures and potential accidents. Despite the importance of
   utilizing real-time locating systems (RTLS) for better site safety,
   research on this area has been ubiquitous and a systematic review which
   directly addresses the association between RTLSs and construction safety
   is lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to
   investigate predominant research streams, achievements, and limitations
   to the all existing applications of RTLS technology in construction
   safety management, and suggest potential areas for future research on
   the integration of RTLS applications into wider scopes of onsite safety
   management. The main contribution of this review lies on providing a
   more comprehensive knowledge of the current utilization and further
   development of RTLS applications on improving construction safety
   management. RTLSs have aided safety management process in eight major
   research streams including safety monitoring, accident prevention,
   behavior-based safety, safety alerts and warnings, ergonomics analysis
   and physiological status monitoring, communication-based safety,
   performance evaluation of the developed RTLS-related technologies and
   on-site safety training. However, there are limitations and gaps in
   applying each particular application which are highlighted to clarify
   the future research avenues.},

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {221},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Digital journalism has faced a dramatic change and media companies are
   challenged to use data science algo-rithms to be more competitive in a
   Big Data era. While this is a relatively new area of study in the media
   landscape, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence has
   increased substantially over the last few years. In particular, the
   adoption of data science models for personalization and recommendation
   has attracted the attention of several media publishers. Following this
   trend, this paper presents a research literature analysis on the role of
   Data Science (DS) in Digital Journalism (DJ). Specifically, the aim is
   to present a critical literature review, synthetizing the main
   application areas of DS in DJ, highlighting research gaps, challenges,
   and op-portunities for future studies. Through a systematic literature
   review integrating bibliometric search, text min-ing, and qualitative
   discussion, the relevant literature was identified and extensively
   analyzed. The review reveals an increasing use of DS methods in DJ, with
   almost 47\% of the research being published in the last three years. An
   hierarchical clustering highlighted six main research domains focused on
   text mining, event extraction, online comment analysis, recommendation
   systems, automated journalism, and exploratory data analysis along with
   some machine learning approaches. Future research directions comprise
   developing models to improve personalization and engagement features,
   exploring recommendation algorithms, testing new automated jour-nalism
   solutions, and improving paywall mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Machine-based classification usually involves some computer programs,
   known as algorithms, developed using several mathematical formulations
   to accelerate the automated classification process. Along with the
   exponential increase in the size and computational complexity of the
   data today, such optimized, robust, agile and reliable computational
   algorithms are required which can efficiently carry out these conforming
   classification tasks. In this review paper, deterministic optimization
   techniques have been analysed that are efficiently employed for machine
   learning applications. In this review, systematic literature review
   approach has been adopted in which 200 research articles were downloaded
   from which 100 latest articles has been selected based on the most
   commonly employed neural networks' techniques. Moreover, the reported
   neural networks techniques based on Back Propagation Neural Network
   (BPNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Algorithm and
   Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) with several hybridized classification
   algorithms based on optimization techniques have been indicated that are
   commonly used to optimize and benefit the classification process. (C)

   with Automated Content Analysis},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {An extremely dynamic and fast-moving environment is pushing enterprises
   to continuous innovation and change. Managing sustainability in a
   digitalized environment seems to be of central importance for policy
   makers, as information technologies (IT), in combination with
   sustainability objectives, offer a wide range of opportunities for
   positive change. Through a systematic literature review and the
   application of automated content analysis, this study aims to provide
   insights into the latest research in the interdisciplinary field of
   sustainable business models and information systems. The results of the
   analysis, combined with a researcher's perspective, suggest that IT,
   which can be used to achieve sustainability objectives, are already in
   place and have an infinite number of potential implications in the
   future. The results suggest that positive economic, social, and
   environmental changes can be achieved by using IT as long as they are
   used to identify unsustainable actions and enable positive change. The
   analysis of research trends revealed a discrepancy between the research
   in the European Union and the rest of the world and pointed to several
   avenues for future research.},

Title = {Automated guided vehicles position control: a systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1483-1545},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are essential elements of manufacturing
   intralogistics and material handling. Improving the position accuracy
   along the AGV trajectory allows the vehicle to work on narrower aisles
   with lower error tolerance. Despite the increasing number of papers in
   AGVs and mobile robots' position control research area, there is a lack
   of curatorial work presenting and analyzing the control strategies
   applied in the problem domain. Therefore, the main objective is to
   analyze the published researches of the past seven years on the position
   control of AGVs to recognize research patterns, gaps, and tendencies,
   outlining the research field. The paper proposes a systematic literature
   review to investigate the research field from the controller design
   perspective. Its protocol and procedures are presented in detail. Four
   main research topics were addressed: the control strategies used in the
   AGV position control problem, how the literature presents the AGV
   operating requirement of position accuracy, how the literature validate
   the proposed controller and present their results regarding the system's
   position accuracy, and the technological tendencies the proposed
   solutions reveals. Besides, within the main topics, other points were
   investigated, such as the AGV application area, the considered
   mathematical model, the sensors and guidance system used, and the
   maximum payload of the vehicle and operation under different load
   conditions. The data synthesis shows the predominant control strategies
   applied to the problem and the interaction among distinct control theory
   areas, indicating a notable interaction of Intelligent Control
   techniques to the other strategies. The paper's contributions are using
   a systematic literature review method over the AGV position control
   publications, presenting an overview of the research area, analyzing the
   research question topics from selected articles, and proposing a
   research agenda.},

Title = {A Comprehensive Review of Path Planning for Agricultural Ground Robots},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The population of the world is predicted to reach nine billion by 2050,
   implying that agricultural output must continue to rise. To deal with
   population expansion, agricultural chores must be mechanized and
   automated. Over the last decade, ground robots have been developed for a
   variety of agricultural applications, with autonomous and safe
   navigation being one of the most difficult hurdles in this development.
   When a mobile platform moves autonomously, it must perform a variety of
   tasks, including localization, route planning, motion control, and
   mapping, which is a critical stage in autonomous operations. This
   research examines several agricultural applications as well as the path
   planning approach used. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   current literature on path/trajectory planning aspects of ground robots
   in agriculture using a systematic literature review technique, to
   contribute to the goal of contributing new information in the field.
   Coverage route planning appears to be less advanced in agriculture than
   point-to-point path routing, according to the finding, which is due to
   the fact that covering activities are usually required for agricultural
   applications, but precision agriculture necessitates point-to-point
   navigation. In the recent era, precision agriculture is getting more
   attention. The conclusion presented here demonstrates that both field
   coverage and point-to-point navigation have been applied successfully in
   path planning for agricultural robots.},

Journal = {TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {As one of the most disruptive technological innovations, blockchain
   technology has received extensive attention from academia and industry.
   Although many scholars have reviewed the existing blockchain research,
   most of the previous review articles focused on the application of
   technology or blockchain in specific industries or scenarios, and lacked
   a comprehensive review of the application of blockchain technology in
   the business field. Based on a systematic literature review approach and
   cluster analysis, this study quantitatively analyzed 2830 papers
   obtained from the Web of Science to fill this gap. By constructing a
   three-layer research framework, this research enumerates the
   infrastructure and protocols of blockchain technology in detail, and on
   this basis develops a three-subjects value creation model. The model
   highlights that business value can be created from transactions,
   crypto-economic models, and analytical and automated processes in the
   interaction of organizations, individuals, and technologies. Different
   blockchainbased applications solve different kinds of economic problems,
   including information storage/ sharing, consensus generation and
   governance. This study expands the blockchain literature and deepens our
   understanding of how blockchain technology affects organizations and
   individuals in the business world. The newly proposed research framework
   can inspire practitioners and managers to discover opportunities for
   business model innovation. This work provides a solid research
   foundation and practical guidance for academics and practitioners who
   are interested in blockchain-based business.},

Title = {Applications of machine learning to BIM: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows are becoming very
   relevant for the different stages of the project's lifecycle, more data
   is produced and managed across it. The information and data accumulated
   in BIMbased projects present an opportunity for analysis and extraction
   of project knowledge from the inception to the operation phase. In other
   industries, Machine Learning (ML) has been demonstrated to be an
   effective approach to automate processes and extract useful insights
   from different types and sources of data. The rapid development of ML
   applications, the growing generation of BIM-related data in projects,
   and the different needs for use of this data present serious challenges
   to adopt and effectively apply ML techniques to BIM-based projects in
   the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO)
   industry. While research on the use of BIM data through ML has increased
   in the past decade, it is still in a nascent stage. In order to asses
   where the industry stands today, this paper carries out a systematic
   literature review (SLR) identifying and summarizing common emerging
   areas of application and utilization of ML within the context of
   BIM-generated data. Moreover, the paper identifies research gaps and
   trends. Based on the observed limitations, prominent future research
   directions are suggested, focusing on information architecture and data,
   applications scalability, and human information interactions.},

   phases and model geometry considered by the literature along with
   reported interoperability issues, are also analysed. Secondly, an expert
   review of grey literature focusing on EU funded projects, guidelines,
   reports, best practices and key initiatives on the field of BIM to BPS
   interoperability is presented. The study wraps up by reporting on six
   major research trends identified by the review and highlighting future
   developments. The results of the review seem to indicate that effective
   interoperability can be achieved with the definition of a commonly
   accepted strategy, integrating shared guidelines for modelling, a better
   inclusion of energy evaluations through the whole life cycle of a
   building and the upgrade of software application for the accurate
   production of information with open format exchange files.},

Title = {The Expanding Role of Artificial Intelligence in Collaborative Robots
   for Industrial Applications: A Systematic Review of Recent Works},
Journal = {MACHINES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A collaborative robot, or cobot, enables users to work closely with it
   through direct communication without the use of traditional barricades.
   Cobots eliminate the gap that has historically existed between
   industrial robots and humans while they work within fences. Cobots can
   be used for a variety of tasks, from communication robots in public
   areas and logistic or supply chain robots that move materials inside a
   building, to articulated or industrial robots that assist in automating
   tasks which are not ergonomically sound, such as assisting individuals
   in carrying large parts, or assembly lines. Human faith in collaboration
   has increased through human-robot collaboration applications built with
   dependability and safety in mind, which also enhances employee
   performance and working circumstances. Artificial intelligence and
   cobots are becoming more accessible due to advanced technology and new
   processor generations. Cobots are now being changed from science fiction
   to science through machine learning. They can quickly respond to change,
   decrease expenses, and enhance user experience. In order to identify the
   existing and potential expanding role of artificial intelligence in
   cobots for industrial applications, this paper provides a systematic
   literature review of the latest research publications between 2018 and
   2022. It concludes by discussing various difficulties in current
   industrial collaborative robots and provides direction for future
   research.},

Title = {Deep learning techniques for suicide and depression detection from
   online social media: A scoping review},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Psychological health, i.e., citizens' emotional and mental well-being,
   is one of the most neglected public health issues. Depression is the
   most common mental health issue and the leading cause of suicide and
   self-injurious behavior. Clinical diagnosis of these mental health
   issues is expensive and also ignored due to social stigma and lack of
   awareness. Nowadays, online social media has become the preferred mode
   of communication, which people use to express their thoughts, feelings,
   and emotions. Hence, user-generated content from online social media can
   be leveraged for non-clinical mental health assessment and surveillance.
   Conventional machine learning and NLP techniques have been used for the
   automated detection of mental health issues using social media data for
   a very long time now. However, the objective of our research is to study
   the applications of deep learning techniques for early detection and
   non-clinical, predictive diagnosis of depression, self-harm, and suicide
   ideation from online social network content only. To the best of our
   knowledge, we did not find any systematic literature review that studies
   the applications of deep learning techniques in this domain. In order to
   address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review
   (SLR) of 96 relevant research studies published until date that have
   applied deep learning techniques for detecting depression and suicide or
   self-harm behavior from social media content. Our work comprehensively
   covers state-ofthe-art w.r.t. techniques, features, datasets, and
   performance metrics, which can be of great value to researchers. We
   enumerate all the available datasets in this domain and discuss their
   characteristics. We also discuss the research gaps, challenges, and
   future research directions for advancing \& catalyzing research in this
   domain. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the only and the most
   recent survey for this domain covering the latest research published
   until date. Based on our learnings from this review, we have also
   proposed a framework for mental health surveillance. We believe the
   findings of our work will be beneficial for researchers working in this
   domain. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Integrating artificial intelligence and analytics in smart grids: a
   systematic literature review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},

Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the latest approaches in
   integrating artificial intelligence and analytics (AIA) in energy smart
   grid projects. Empirical results are synthesized to highlight their
   relevance from a technology and project management standpoint,
   identifying several lessons learned that can be used for planning highly
   integrated and automated smart grid projects.
   Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review leads to
   selecting 108 research articles dealing with smart grids and AIA
   applications. Keywords are based on the following research questions:
   What is the growth trend in Smart Grid projects using intelligent
   systems and data analytics? What business value is offered when AI-based
   methods are applied? How do applications of intelligent systems combine
   with data analytics? What lessons can be learned for Smart Grid and AIA
   projects? Findings The 108 selected articles are classified according to
   the following four research issues in smart grids project management:
   AIA integrated applications; AI-focused technologies; analytics-focused
   technologies; architecture and design methods. A broad set of smart grid
   functionality is reviewed, seeking to find commonality among several
   applications, including as follows: dynamic energy management;
   automation of extract, transform and load for Supervisory Control And
   Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems data; multi-level representations of
   data; the relationship between the standard three-phase transforms and
   modern data analytics; real-time or short-time voltage stability
   assessment; smart city architecture; home energy management system;
   building energy consumption; automated fault and disturbance analysis;
   and power quality control. Originality/value Given the diversity of
   issues reviewed, a more capability-focused research agenda is needed to
   further synthesize empirical findings for AI-based smart grids. Research
   may converge toward more focus on business rules systems, that may best
   support smart grid design, proof development, governance and
   effectiveness. These AIA technologies must be further integrated with
   smart grid project management methodologies and enable a greater
   diversity of renewable and non-renewable production sources.},

Abstract = {Business Process Management is a new strategy for process management
   that is having a major impact today. Mainly, its use is focused on the
   industrial, services, and business sector. However, in recent years, it
   has begun to apply for optimizing clinical processes. So far, no studies
   that evaluate its true impact on the healthcare sector have been found.
   This systematic review aims to assess the results of the application of
   Business Process Management methodology on clinical processes, analyzing
   whether it can become a useful tool to improve the effectiveness and
   quality of processes. We conducted a systematic literature review using
   ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Springer databases.
   After the electronic search process in different databases, 18 articles
   met the pre-established requirements. The findings support the use of
   Business Process Management as an effective methodology to optimize
   clinical processes. Business Process Management has proven to be a
   feasible and useful methodology to design and optimize clinical
   processes, as well as to automate tasks. However, a more comprehensive
   follow-up of this methodology, better technological support, and greater
   involvement of all the clinical staff are factors that play a key role
   for the development of its true potential.},

Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 19},
Abstract = {The increasing popularity of mHealth is a promising opportunity for pain
   self-management. Mobile apps can be easily developed, but understanding
   the design and usability will result in apps that can retain more users.
   This research aims at identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing the
   current state-of-the-art of: (a) the design approach and (b) usability
   assessment of pain management mobile applications. A systematic
   literature review was conducted on 27 studies retrieved from Medline,
   PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus. The review revealed that
   most of the apps were for chronic pain. No app was specifically for men
   or for the elderly. None of the studies involved expert-based system
   inspection methods. Only one study used two different approaches of
   automated and empirical evaluation. We mapped the identified usability
   issues to ISO 9241-11 and ISO/IEC 25010, and aggregated the
   recommendations for improvement. Moreover, we also identified certain
   issues that are solely concerned with the patient's behavior. We
   organized the issues into taxonomies of design considerations for
   building usable pain self-management mobile applications. As pain is
   prevalent among the elderly, pain management will be much needed while
   moving toward an aging society. However, we found that the involvement
   of the elderly in the development of pain management mobile apps is very
   minimal, which may affect the utility and usability of the apps.},

Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {With the deployment of the 5G cellular system, the upsurge of diverse
   mobile applications and devices has increased the potential challenges
   and threats posed to users. Industry and academia have attempted to
   address cyber security challenges by implementing automated malware
   detection and machine learning algorithms. This study expands on
   previous research on machine learning-based mobile malware detection. We
   critically evaluate 154 selected articles and highlight their strengths
   and weaknesses as well as potential improvements. We explore the mobile
   malware detection techniques used in recent studies based on attack
   intentions, such as server, network, client software, client hardware,
   and user. In contrast to other SLR studies, our study classified the
   means of attack as supervised and unsupervised learning. Therefore, this
   article aims at providing researchers with in-depth knowledge in the
   field and identifying potential future research and a framework for a
   thorough evaluation. Furthermore, we review and summarize security
   challenges related to cybersecurity that can lead to more effective and

Title = {Learning software configuration spaces: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {182},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Most modern software systems (operating systems like Linux or Android,
   Web browsers like Firefox or Chrome, video encoders like ffmpeg, x264 or
   VLC, mobile and cloud applications, etc.) are highly configurable.
   Hundreds of configuration options, features, or plugins can be combined,
   each potentially with distinct functionality and effects on execution
   time, security, energy consumption, etc. Due to the combinatorial
   explosion and the cost of executing software, it is quickly impossible
   to exhaustively explore the whole configuration space. Hence, numerous
   works have investigated the idea of learning it from a small sample of
   configurations' measurements. The pattern ``sampling, measuring,
   learning{''} has emerged in the literature, with several practical
   interests for both software developers and end-users of configurable
   systems. In this systematic literature review, we report on the
   different application objectives (e.g., performance prediction,
   configuration optimization, constraint mining), use-cases, targeted
   software systems, and application domains. We review the various
   strategies employed to gather a representative and cost-effective
   sample. We describe automated software techniques used to measure
   functional and non-functional properties of configurations. We classify
   machine learning algorithms and how they relate to the pursued
   application. Finally, we also describe how researchers evaluate the
   quality of the learning process. The findings from this systematic
   review show that the potential application objective is important; there
   are a vast number of case studies reported in the literature related to
   particular domains or software systems. Yet, the huge variant space of
   configurable systems is still challenging and calls to further
   investigate the synergies between artificial intelligence and software
   engineering. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Literature Review of Patient Record Structures from the Physician's
   Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The Finnish Patient Data Repository is a nationwide electronic health
   record (EHR) system collecting patient data from all healthcare
   providers. The usefulness of the large amount of data stored in the
   system depends on the underlying data structures, and thus a solid
   understanding of these structures is in focus in further development of
   the data repository. This study seeks to improve that understanding by a
   systematic literature review. The review takes the physician's
   perspective to the use and usefulness of the data structures. The
   articles included in this review study data structures intended to be
   used in the actual care process. Secondary use and nursing aspects have
   been covered in separate reviews. After applying the predefined
   inclusion and exclusion criteria only 40 articles were included in the
   review. The research on widespread systems in everyday use was
   especially scarce, most studies concentrated on narrow fields. Majority
   of these studies were primarily developed for specialist use in
   secondary care units. Most structures or applications studied were at an
   early stage of development. In many applications the use of structured
   data was found to improve the completeness of the documented data and
   facilitate its automated use. However, there seem to be some
   applications where narrative text cannot be easily replaced by
   structured data. Usability results regarding structured representation
   were conflicting. The scattered nature and paucity of research hinders
   the generalizability of the findings, and from the system design or
   implementation point of view the practical value of the scientific
   literature reviewed is limited.},

Abstract = {In the development of quality software, critical decisions related to
   planning, estimating, and managing resources are bound to the correct
   and timely identification of the system needs. In particular, the
   process of classifying this customer input into software requirements
   categories tends to become tedious and error-prone when it comes to
   large-scale systems. On the ground described by a complementary
   systematic literature review, this research introduces a proposal on the
   application of Machine Learning techniques for automated software
   requirements classification. In this regard, the training and later
   hyperparameter optimization through Differential Evolution of five
   classification models are carried out based on quality attributes
   examples found in the available literature. As a case study, these
   models are tested with issue reports collected from five open-source
   projects at GitHub to identify quality-attributes-related knowledge on
   such user feedback. The finding of the most characteristic terms by
   quality attribute through the TF-IDF algorithm stands out from the
   training. The results show a moderately high ability to classify other
   generic software requirements correctly, achieving a Geometric Mean of
   up to 82.51\%. However, the same classifiers applied to issue reports
   showed significant difficulties identifying information related to
   quality attributes, since an F-Score no greater than 50\% was reached.},

Abstract = {Body weight measurement of animals is often labor-intensive for farmers
   and stressful for animals. To this end, several methods have been
   researched and implemented to automate this process. In this study, we
   performed a Systematic Literature Review to identify and synthesise the
   published studies on the body weight estimation approaches for livestock
   (i.e. cattle and pigs). Information about features of models, underlying
   methods, performance evaluation parameters, challenges, and solutions
   using computer vision-based weight estimation, and characteristics of
   the future vision-based weight estimation models were presented based on
   the identified scientific papers. We found 151 papers, of which 26
   papers were selected as primary studies that we analyzed in detail. We
   identified that: (1) seven features, namely top view body area, withers
   height, hip height, body length, hip-width, body volume, and chest girth
   are widely used in approaches; (2) 3D Time of Flight camera is the most
   preferred one; (3) the linear regression is the most used algorithm; (4)
   the application of Deep Learning algorithms is still very limited; and
   (5) coefficient of determination is the most used evaluation parameter
   for weight estimation. In addition to these observations, 13 challenges,
   22 solutions, and guidelines for future research direction were
   presented.},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (Al) has transformed the world and the
   relationships among humans as the learning capabilities of machines have
   allowed for a new means of communication between humans and machines. In
   the field of health, there is much interest in new technologies that
   help to improve and automate services in hospitals. This article aims to
   explore the literature related to conversational agents applied to
   health care, searching for definitions, patterns, methods,
   architectures, and data types. Furthermore, this work identifies an
   agent application taxonomy, current challenges, and research gaps. In
   this work, we use a systematic literature review approach.
   We guide and refine this study and the research questions by applying
   Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context (PICOC)
   criteria. The present study investigated approximately 4145 articles
   involving conversational agents in health published over the last ten
   years. In this context, we finally selected 40 articles based on their
   approaches and objectives as related to our main subject. As a result,
   we developed a taxonomy, identified the main challenges in the field,
   and defined the main types of dialog and contexts related to
   conversational agents in health. These results contributed to
   discussions regarding conversational health agents, and highlighted some
   research gaps for future study. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decade, Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML)
   have been used for developing semi or fully automated systems of any
   application. Due to the advancement in networking technologies, the
   contribution of video-based input is also rising for IoT systems. Hence,
   Internet of Video Things (IoVT) has been an emerging field to gain more
   human trust in the systems. IoVT is an integrated attempt of computer
   vision sensors, networking, video or image processing and information
   storage systems. In this paper, we have highlighted the literature
   evidence in the IoVT field. There is a need to analyze it in terms of
   different aspects, that enables the researchers to understand research
   trends in the field and lead them to future research directions.
   Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) in
   IoVT using various research publications, since its evolution. The study
   applies article selection criteria on different search methods and
   compares the relevant published articles. We have analyzed these
   filtered articles for identifying the study trends, their used
   techniques \& frameworks for data processing and inputs or datasets used
   for their studies. At the end, various research opportunities and
   challenges have been framed in the field for future research references.},

Title = {Metamorphic relation automation: Rationale, challenges, and solution
   directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Metamorphic testing addresses the issue of the oracle problem by
   comparing results transformation from multiple test executions. The
   relationship that governs the output transformation is called
   metamorphic relation. Metamorphic relations require expert knowledge and
   the generation of them is considered a time-consuming task. Researchers
   have proposed various techniques to automate metamorphic testing,
   generation, and selection. Although there are several research articles
   on this issue, there is a lack of overview of the state-of-the-art of
   metamorphic relation automation. As such, we performed a systematic
   literature review study to collect, extract, and synthesize the required
   data. Based on our research questions, the literature was categorized
   and summarized into different categories. We found that the automation
   of metamorphic relation is most effective in mathematical and scientific
   applications. We concluded that some approaches involve analysis of
   different forms of software-related information such as control flow

Abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) are artificial intelligence (AI)
   techniques used in the automated recognition and classification of
   pathological changes from clinical images in areas such as
   ophthalmology, dermatology, and oral medicine. The combination of
   enterprise imaging and AI is gaining notoriety for its potential
   benefits in healthcare areas such as cardiology, dermatology,
   ophthalmology, pathology, physiatry, radiation oncology, radiology, and
   endoscopic. The present study aimed to analyze, through a systematic
   literature review, the application of performance of ANN and deep
   learning in the recognition and automated classification of lesions from
   clinical images, when comparing to the human performance. The PRISMA
   2020 approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-analyses) was used by searching four databases of studies that
   reference the use of IA to define the diagnosis of lesions in
   ophthalmology, dermatology, and oral medicine areas. A quantitative and
   qualitative analyses of the articles that met the inclusion criteria
   were performed. The search yielded the inclusion of 60 studies. It was
   found that the interest in the topic has increased, especially in the
   last 3 years. We observed that the performance of IA models is
   promising, with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, most of
   them had outcomes equivalent to human comparators. The reproducibility
   of the performance of models in real-life practice has been reported as
   a critical point. Study designs and results have been progressively
   improved. IA resources have the potential to contribute to several areas
   of health. In the coming years, it is likely to be incorporated into
   everyday life, contributing to the precision and reducing the time
   required by the diagnostic process.},

Title = {ChatGPT in Supply Chains: Initial Evidence of Applications and Potential
   Research Agenda},
Journal = {LOGISTICS-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: ChatGPT has been largely discussed since it was launched in
   November 2022. Problem statement: the main approaches of ChatGPT in the
   recent and scarce literature are more focused on the impacts for general
   use, applied sciences and educational systems, which evidences a
   relevant gap for the management field, especially related to the supply
   chain area. Objectives: as a novel and initial contribution, this
   article aims to provide a viewpoint with the main applications and other
   issues regarding ChatGPT in supply chains, based on the initial
   discovered evidence. Methods: This viewpoint article is grounded on the
   few articles available in specialized magazines, blogs and company
   websites that approach potential applications and other issues of
   ChatGPT in supply chains, as a systematic literature review was not
   possible due to the absence of papers approaching the subject in the
   research databases. Contributions: this article contributes to the
   practitioners involved in supply chain activities who desire to have an
   initial and structured content related to the impacts and applications
   of ChatGPT on supply chains. It also seeks to encourage researchers on
   further research deployments in this field by presenting potential
   research agenda topics. Results: first evidence based on quality results
   from the analyzed content showed that, although it may take time until
   this technology evolves to a desirable level of maturity, it may be
   applied in different areas of supply chain management (e.g., route
   optimization, predictive maintenance, order shipment, customer and
   supplier relationships, data analysis, ordering process, automating
   invoices, reducing waste, workforce training and guidance, amongst
   others), with a potential generation of significant benefits such as
   cost reductions and the improvement of supply chain performance.},

   environments: Systematic literature review},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Uncovering community structure has made a significant advancement in
   explaining, analyzing, and forecasting behaviors and dynamics of
   networks related to different fields in sociology, criminology, biology,
   medicine, communication, economics, and academia. Detecting and
   clustering communities is a powerful step toward identifying the
   structural properties and the behavioral patterns in social networks.
   Recently, online learning has been progressively adopted by a lot of
   educational practices which raise many questions about assessing the
   learners' engagement, collaboration, and behaviors in the new emerging
   learning communities. This systematic literature review aims to assess
   the use of community detection techniques in analyzing the network's
   structure in online learning environments. It provides a comprehensive
   overview of the existing research that adopted those techniques with
   identifying the educational objectives behind their application as well
   as suggesting possible future research directions. Our analysis covered
   65 studies that found in the literature and applied different community
   discovery techniques on various types of online learning environments to
   analyze their users' interactions patterns. Our review revealed the
   potential of this field in improving educational practices and decisions
   and in utilizing the massive amount of data generated from interacting
   with those environments. Finally, we highlighted the need to include
   automated community discovery techniques in online learning environments
   to facilitate and enhance their use as well as we stressed on the urge
   for further advance research to uncover a lot of hidden opportunities.

Title = {Review the role of artificial intelligence in detecting and preventing
   financial fraud using natural language processing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 26},
Abstract = {Frauds accounted for significant losses in the financial sector and
   emerged as the industry's biggest challenge. Companies invest
   significant amounts to prevent such fraud. It has been reported that
   63.6\% of the financial institutions that use Automated Fraud prevention
   methods successfully prevented frauds before their occurrence. Some
   estimations suggest that 80\% of specialists are confident in cutting
   down fraud using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based platforms. Several
   research studies have also administered AI-based techniques for fraud
   prevention. This study takes a systematic literature review approach to
   uncover the emerging areas of fraud detection using AI. The authors have
   analyzed 241 research articles published in the last 20 years. The
   Scopus database was the source of the articles in the literature review.
   The meta-analysis and network analysis were carried out, and the output
   shows the up trend of this research domain. Author-coauthor network
   collaboration is analyzed using the VOSviewer tool. K-means clustering
   was performed to identify the critical research domain, and future
   research areas were also identified. This research will act as a
   reference for future scholars who want to perform analysis on the
   application of AI techniques in financial fraud detection and
   prevention. We finally conclude the study by identifying the scope of
   future research and will be a value addition for financial fraud
   researchers.},

Title = {Decomposition of Monolith Applications Into Microservices Architectures:
   A Systematic Review},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {49},
Number = {8},
Pages = {4213-4242},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Microservices architecture has gained significant traction, in part
   owing to its potential to deliver scalable, robust, agile, and
   failure-resilient software products. Consequently, many companies that
   use large and complex software systems are actively looking for
   automated solutions to decompose their monolith applications into
   microservices. This paper rigorously examines 35 research papers
   selected from well-known databases using a Systematic Literature Review
   (SLR) protocol and snowballing method, extracting data to answer the
   research questions, and presents the following four contributions.
   First, the Monolith to Microservices Decomposition Framework (M2MDF)
   which identifies the major phases and key elements of decomposition.
   Second, a detailed analysis of existing decomposition approaches, tools
   and methods. Third, we identify the metrics and datasets used to
   evaluate and validate monolith to microservice decomposition processes.
   Fourth, we propose areas for future research. Overall, the findings
   suggest that monolith decomposition into microservices remains at an
   early stage and there is an absence of methods for combining static,
   dynamic, and evolutionary data. Insufficient tool support is also in
   evidence. Furthermore, standardised metrics, datasets, and baselines
   have yet to be established. These findings can assist practitioners
   seeking to understand the various dimensions of monolith decomposition
   and the community's current capabilities in that endeavour. The findings
   are also of value to researchers looking to identify areas to further
   extend research in the monolith decomposition space.},

Abstract = {Automatic identification and data collection provides an ideal basis for
   Industry 4.0 Smart Manufacturing. The manufacturing sectors, involving a
   wide spectrum of physical and digital world, are functioning in
   extremely challenging environment. To optimize production efficiency,
   the incorporation of automated data collection technologies such as Bar
   Code and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is essential. Both these
   technologies have a great overlap in terms of industrial applications
   and no study reviews the existing literature in this regard. Therefore
   to cope up this matter, a systematic literature review has been
   conducted in which the technologies have been studied and compared,
   followed by the detailed discussion under various contexts of
   Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework. It has been
   observed that both these technologies have been employed in various
   manufacturing domains such as lean manufacturing, inventory management
   and production planning. However, it has been observed that RFID
   technology carried technological superiority over Bar Code technology.
   The systems utilizing the former are highly reliable, exquisitely
   capable and perform excellent in case of automation. However, issues
   such as high capital costs and increased level of technical complexity
   are few dilemmas in case of adopting RFID based systems. In addition to
   that, the implementation of RFID systems is complemented by certain
   essential features of TOE framework, which can help to elevate
   competitiveness and efficiency of an organization regarding tracking and
   identification of assets and inventory.},

Abstract = {Software development in project teams has become more and more complex,
   with increasing demands for information and decision making. Software
   development in projects also hugely depends on effective interaction
   between people, and human factors have been identified as key to
   successful software projects. Especially in this context, managing and
   analyzing social networks is highly important. The instrument of social
   network analysis (SNA) provides finegrained methods for analyzing social
   networks in project teams, going beyond the traditional tools and
   techniques of project management. This paper examines the importance of
   the application of SNA in software development projects. We conducted a
   systematic literature review (SLR) of research on software development
   projects and social network data published between 1980 and 2019. We
   identified and analyzed 86 relevant studies, finding that research on
   software development projects spans the topics of project organization,
   communication management, knowledge management, version and
   configuration management, requirement management, and risk management.
   Further, we show that most studies focus on project organization and
   that the most common method used to gather social data relies on
   automated extraction from various software development repositories in
   the SNA context. Our paper contributes to the software development
   literature by providing a broad overview of published studies on the use
   of social networks in helping software development projects. Finally, we
   identify research opportunities and make suggestions for addressing
   existing research gaps.},

Title = {BIM and LCA Integration: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To foster sustainable development, the environmental impacts of the
   construction sector need to be reduced substantially. Life cycle
   assessment (LCA) is the established methodology for the quantification
   of environmental impacts, and therefore has been increasingly applied to
   assess the environmental performance of buildings. By coupling LCAs with
   digital design tools, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), the
   identification of environmental hotspots and their mitigation is
   possible during the design process. The objective of the study is to
   identify the current integration approaches, and determine the pros and
   cons of the integration process from different viewpoints, namely,
   technical, informational, organizational and functional issues.
   Therefore, a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) was
   performed. We identified 60 relevant BIM-LCA case studies and analyzed
   the applied BIM-LCA workflows in detail. A total of 16 of the reviewed
   studies applied LCA during the early design stage. These studies used a
   manual or semiautomatic data exchange between the BIM models and LCA
   tools. In most cases, contemporary BIM-LCA workflows utilized
   conventional spreadsheets (e.g., Excel sheets in 16 cases). However, the
   analysis shows that an automated link between LCA and BIM can be
   achieved when overcoming the technical, organizational and informational
   issues discussed in the paper. This could enable the streamlining of LCA
   applications in design practice, and thus support the necessary
   improvements in the environmental performance of buildings.},

Title = {A review on AI Safety in highly automated driving},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Remarkable progress in the fields of machine learning (ML) and
   artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an increased number of
   applications of (data-driven) AI systems for the partial or complete
   control of safety-critical systems. Recently, ML solutions have been
   particularly popular. Such approaches are often met with concerns
   regarding their correct and safe execution, which is often caused by
   missing knowledge or intransparency of their exact functionality. The
   investigation and derivation of methods for the safety assessment of AI
   systems are thus of great importance. Among others, these issues are
   addressed in the field of AI Safety. The aim of this work is to provide
   an overview of this field by means of a systematic literature review
   with special focus on the area of highly automated driving, as well as
   to present a selection of approaches and methods for the safety
   assessment of AI systems. Particularly, validation, verification, and
   testing are considered in light of this context. In the review process,
   two distinguished classes of approaches have been identified: On the one
   hand established methods, either referring to already published
   standards or well-established concepts from multiple research areas
   outside ML and AI. On the other hand newly developed approaches,
   including methods tailored to the scope of ML and AI which gained
   importance only in recent years.},

Title = {Conceptualization of a fresh groundwater lens influenced by climate
   change: A modeling study of an arid-region island in the Persian Gulf,
   Iran},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {519},
Number = {A},
Pages = {399-413},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Understanding the fresh groundwater lens (FGL) behavior and potential
   threat of climatic-induced seawater intrusion (SWI) are significant for
   the future water resources management of many small islands. In this
   paper, the FGL of Kish Island, an arid-region case in the Persian Gulf,
   Iran, is modeled using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
   simulations. These simulations are based on the application of SUTRA, a
   density-dependent groundwater numerical model. Also, the numerical model
   parameters are calibrated using PEST, an automated parameter estimation
   code.
   Firstly a detailed conceptualization of the FGL model is completed to
   understand the sensitivity of the FGL to some particular aspects of the
   model prior to analysis of climate change simulations. For these
   investigations, the FGL system is defined based on Kish Island system to
   accomplish the integrated comparison of features of a conceptual model
   that are representative of real-world systems. This is the first study
   which adopts such an approach. The comparison of cross-sectional
   simulations suggests that the two-layer properties of the Kish Island
   aquifer have a significant influence on the FGL while the impacts of
   lateral-boundary irregularities are negligible. The impacts of sea-level
   rise (SLR), associated land-surface inundation (LSI), and variations in
   recharge rate on the FGL salinization of Kish Island are investigated
   numerically. Variations of SLR value (1-4 m) and net recharge rate
   (17-24 mm/year) are considered to cover a possible range of climatic
   scenarios in this arid-region island. The 2D and 3D simulation results
   demonstrate that LSI caused by SLR and recharge rate variation impacts
   are more important factors in the FGL in comparison to estimated SLR
   impacts without LSI. It is also shown that climate change impacts on the
   FGL are long-term to reach a new FGL equilibrium in the case of Kish
   Island's aquifer system. The comparative analysis of 2D and 3D results
   shows that three-dimensionality is a significant factor, especially in
   large-scale 3D systems of small islands. The results of this study are
   expected to have implications for the understanding and management of
   the fresh groundwater resources of Kish Island and are also expected to
   be relevant to the study of the impact of climate change on groundwater
   resources on islands worldwide. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Requirements monitoring frameworks: A systematic review},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {89-109},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context: Software systems today often interoperate with each other, thus
   forming a system of systems (SoS). Due to the scale, complexity, and
   heterogeneity of SoS, determining compliance with their requirements is
   challenging, despite the range of existing monitoring approaches. The
   fragmented research landscape and the diversity of existing approaches,
   however, make it hard to understand and analyze existing research
   regarding its suitability for SoS.
   Objective: The aims of this paper are thus to systematically identify,
   describe, and classify existing approaches for requirements-based
   monitoring of software systems at runtime. Specifically, we (i) analyze
   the characteristics and application areas of monitoring approaches
   proposed in different domains, we (ii) systematically identify
   frameworks supporting requirements monitoring, and finally (iii) analyze
   their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
   Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify
   existing monitoring approaches and to classify their key characteristics
   and application areas. Based on this analysis we selected requirements
   monitoring frameworks, following a definition by Robinson, and analyzed
   them regarding their support for requirements monitoring in SoS.
   Results: We identified 330 publications, which we used to produce a
   comprehensive overview of the landscape of requirements monitoring
   approaches. We analyzed these publications regarding their support for
   Robinson's requirements monitoring layers, resulting in 37 identified
   frameworks. We investigated how well these frameworks support
   requirements monitoring in SoS.
   Conclusions: We conclude that most existing approaches are restricted to
   certain kinds of checks, particular types of events and data, and mostly
   also limited to one particular architectural style and technology. This
   lack of flexibility makes their application in an SoS context difficult.
   Also, systematic and automated variability management is still missing.
   Regarding their evaluation, many existing frameworks focus on measuring
   the performance overhead, while only few frameworks have been assessed
   in cases studies with real-world systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Algorithmic discrimination in the credit domain: what do we know about
   it?},
Journal = {AI \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 17},
Abstract = {The widespread usage of machine learning systems and econometric methods
   in the credit domain has transformed the decision-making process for
   evaluating loan applications. Automated analysis of credit applications
   diminishes the subjectivity of the decision-making process. On the other
   hand, since machine learning is based on past decisions recorded in the
   financial institutions' datasets, the process very often consolidates
   existing bias and prejudice against groups defined by race, sex, sexual
   orientation, and other attributes. Therefore, the interest in
   identifying, preventing, and mitigating algorithmic discrimination has
   grown exponentially in many areas, such as Computer Science, Economics,
   Law, and Social Science. We conducted a comprehensive systematic
   literature review to understand (1) the research settings, including the
   discrimination theory foundation, the legal framework, and the
   applicable fairness metric; (2) the addressed issues and solutions; and
   (3) the open challenges for potential future research. We explored five
   sources: ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Digital Library,
   Springer Link, and Scopus. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria,
   we selected 78 papers written in English and published between 2017 and
   2022. According to the meta-analysis of this literature survey,
   algorithmic discrimination has been addressed mainly by looking at the
   CS, Law, and Economics perspectives. There has been great interest in
   this topic in the financial area, especially the discrimination in
   providing access to the mortgage market and differential treatment
   (different fees, number of parcels, and interest rates). Most attention
   has been devoted to the potential discrimination due to bias in the
   dataset. Researchers are still only dealing with direct discrimination,
   addressed by algorithmic fairness, while indirect discrimination
   (structural discrimination) has not received the same attention.},

Title = {Automatic documentation of professional health interactions: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {137},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Electronic systems are increasingly present in the healthcare system and
   are often related to improved medical care. However, the widespread use
   of these technologies ended up building a relationship of dependence
   that can disrupt the doctor-patient relationship. In this context,
   digital scribes are automated clinical documentation systems that
   capture the physician-patient conversation and then generate the
   documentation for the appointment, enabling the physician to engage with
   the patient entirely. We have performed a systematic literature review
   on intelligent solutions for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with
   automatic documentation during a medical interview. The scope included
   only original research on systems that could detect speech and
   transcribe it in a natural and structured fashion simultaneously with
   the doctor-patient interaction, excluding speech-to-text-only
   technologies. The search resulted in a total of 1995 titles, with eight
   articles remaining after filtering for the inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. The intelligent models mainly consisted of an ASR system with
   natural language processing capability, a medical lexicon, and
   structured text output. None of the articles had a commercially
   available product at the time of the publication and reported limited
   real-life experience. So far, none of the applications has been
   prospectively validated and tested in large-scale clinical studies.
   Nonetheless, these first reports suggest that automatic speech
   recognition may be a valuable tool in the future to facilitate medical
   registration in a faster and more reliable manner. Improving
   transparency, accuracy, and empathy could drastically change how
   patients and doctors experience a medical visit. Unfortunately, clinical
   data on the usability and benefits of such applications is almost
   non-existent. We believe that future work in this area is necessary and
   needed.},

Title = {Digital technologies and data-driven delay management process for
   construction projects},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {One of the main challenges of construction projects is managing delays;
   there is still a lot to overcome to reach near-zero delays (mitigation
   of delays) in all construction projects. Technology and different
   platforms are applied to support a high volume of data flow acquired
   from multiple resources during the construction project life cycle; how
   can these automated and digital progress tracking systems be considered
   for more effective construction delay management? The aim is to
   investigate the current state of real-time technologies and their
   applications and assess how specific attributes of these disruptive
   technologies can significantly alter delay management in construction
   industries. Therefore, this study presents a new process-based framework
   for using technologies with a data lifecycle viewpoint. This research
   uses a four-step systematic literature review involving identification,
   screening, extortion-eligibility check, and selection-inclusion.
   Furthermore, it is followed up by a thematic content analysis on using
   new technologies to mitigate delays in construction projects. Key
   trends, themes, areas of concern for research, and limitations
   identified in previous literature as research gaps and future needs were
   documented and structured. This work presents a novel process of
   comprehensive classification of real-time technologies that are being
   used in the construction industry to acquire data, screen/analyses data,
   and present information through an Industry 4.0 application: IoT
   technologies such as sensors, RFID etc., smartphones,
   planning/scheduling tools (Ms Project, Primavera), and Building
   Information Modelling (BIM). The developed process-based framework is
   served as a roadmap to 1) centralise real-time communication between
   technologies to collect, analysis and presentation data in construction
   phase, 2) prepare timely reports for project managers to take proper
   action against those problems delaying project.},

Abstract = {Cyberbullying is to bully someone in the digital realm. It has become
   extremely detrimental as the social media and the internet have become
   more popular and omnipresent. People use the internet services to
   viciously attack others from behind a screen. The substantial growth in
   the dimensionality, heterogeneity, subjectivity and multimodality of
   social media and the pressing need to timely curtail the damage
   instigated through cyberbullying, has fostered the need to devise
   automated mechanisms which detect such unfavorable activities. The use
   of soft computing techniques to handle such pernicious issue has been
   studied invariably and widely in literature. This study is to understand
   the viability, scope and significance of this alliance of using soft
   computing techniques for cyberbullying detection on social multimedia.
   This work is a systematic literature review to gather, explore,
   comprehend and analyze the research trends, gaps and prospects of this
   pairing in a well-organized way. The contribution of this study is
   noteworthy as it focuses on the use and application of soft computing
   techniques for cyberbullying detection on social multimedia utilizing a
   meta-analytic approach in order to integrate, interpret and critically
   analyze the findings in the original studies for expounding novel
   approaches to achieve comparable and effectual results pertaining to the
   defined research domain. Published studies starting April 2003, accessed
   from six digital portals (ACM, IEEE, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer and
   Taylor and Francis) have been reviewed to expound the state-of-art
   within the domain to give insightsand finally identify the directions of
   future research.},

Title = {Empirical Evidence of the Usage of Programming Languages in the
   Educational Process},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Number = {3},
Pages = {213-222},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence
   regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is
   presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different
   educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning
   programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the
   massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to
   toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has
   increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to
   use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for
   learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers.
   Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of
   educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the
   research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature
   after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using
   EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were
   performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies
   were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they
   include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the
   evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with
   empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some
   research opportunities are identified which concerns the used
   programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the
   need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in
   non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic)
   contexts.},

   Contributions and Current Limitations},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however,
   it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and
   sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility
   and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV)
   transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing
   electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and
   secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary
   functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as
   data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized
   charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to
   significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and
   guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its
   application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated
   energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain
   technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention
   has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art
   analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this
   work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based
   applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current
   challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can
   contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and
   future research directions related to the integration of blockchain
   technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study
   incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles
   published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a
   method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding
   blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of
   blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and
   security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging
   optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic
   review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we
   identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of
   this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in
   the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain
   technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b)
   we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory
   areas.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of the Use of Technology to Monitor Welfare in Zoo
   Animals: Is There Space for Improvement?},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Ensuring appropriate animal welfare to promote wildlife
   conservation is a top priority of modern zoos, leading to greater effort
   to improve welfare monitoring approaches. However, more traditional
   procedures can present some limitations, while the implementation of
   technology might become an extra tool to comply with the need of a more
   efficient welfare assessment. This study aimed to summarise the
   available body of research on technologies used for the assessment of
   animal welfare in zoos. The results revealed that the majority of
   publications were published from 2015 onwards suggesting that this
   research field is still young. So far, the use of technology to assess
   zoo animal welfare has focused mainly on large mammals likely due to the
   emotional impact and interest that they have on the public and media
   worldwide. In addition, despite the employment of both detached and
   wearable sensors to assess animal welfare in zoos, implementation of
   algorithms to enable real-time monitoring of the animals is still scarce
   compared to research on farm animals. Greater application of
   technologies in zoo research and on more taxa should be the focus of
   future studies, so that another effective welfare assessment approach
   can be used together with more traditional procedures to improve zoo
   animal welfare and ultimately promote wildlife conservation. A top
   priority of modern zoos is to ensure good animal welfare (AW), thus,
   efforts towards improving AW monitoring are increasing. Welfare
   assessments are performed through more traditional approaches by
   employing direct observations and time-consuming data collection that
   require trained specialists. These limitations may be overcome through
   automated monitoring using wearable or remotely placed sensors. However,
   in this fast-developing field, the level of automated AW monitoring used
   in zoos is unclear. Hence, the aim of this systematic literature review
   was to investigate research conducted on the use of technology for AW
   assessment in zoos with a focus on real-time automated monitoring
   systems. The search led to 19 publications with 18 of them published in
   the last six years. Studies focused on mammals (89.5\%) with elephant as
   the most studied species followed by primates. The most used
   technologies were camera (52.6\%) and wearable sensors (31.6\%) mainly
   used to measure behaviour, while the use of algorithms was reported in
   two publications only. This research area is still young in zoos and
   mainly focused on large mammals. Despite an increase in publications
   employing automated AW monitoring in the last years, the potential for
   this to become an extra useful tool needs further research.},

Title = {Exploring the factors influencing the cloud computing adoption: a
   systematic study on cloud migration},
Journal = {SPRINGERPLUS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Today, most of the organizations trust on their age old legacy
   applications, to support their business-critical systems. However, there
   are several critical concerns, as maintainability and scalability
   issues, associated with the legacy system. In this background, cloud
   services offer a more agile and cost effective platform, to support
   business applications and IT infrastructure. As the adoption of cloud
   services has been increasing recently and so has been the academic
   research in cloud migration. However, there is a genuine need of
   secondary study to further strengthen this research. The primary
   objective of this paper is to scientifically and systematically
   identify, categorize and compare the existing research work in the area
   of legacy to cloud migration. The paper has also endeavored to
   consolidate the research on Security issues, which is prime factor
   hindering the adoption of cloud through classifying the studies on
   secure cloud migration. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of thirty
   selected papers, published from 2009 to 2014 was conducted to properly
   understand the nuances of the security framework. To categorize the
   selected studies, authors have proposed a conceptual model for cloud
   migration which has resulted in a resource base of existing solutions
   for cloud migration. This study concludes that cloud migration research
   is in seminal stage but simultaneously it is also evolving and maturing,
   with increasing participation from academics and industry alike. The
   paper also identifies the need for a secure migration model, which can
   fortify organization's trust into cloud migration and facilitate
   necessary tool support to automate the migration process.},

Abstract = {This study illustrates the use of spatial information with high spatial
   resolution digital images to monitor the growth and development of crops
   in research plots and under commercial management. A robust and
   cost-effective technology to generate information endogenously from low
   altitude aerial imagery is described, and examples of applications in
   common beans and bananas are presented. Images were acquired using a
   standard commercial digital or SLR camera lifted by a kite or balloon.
   The optimum camera settings varied with conditions. The feasibility of
   correcting for distortions in the images and calibration of the sensor
   was explored, but it was not possible to automatically correct images
   and standardize the radiometric parameters over a range of conditions.
   Nevertheless, a combination of automated and visual analysis of the
   images obtained provided a means of classifying and quantifying various
   aspects of crop growth and development. This information was shown to be
   related to various bean and banana growth characteristics and can be
   used to predict bean yields and to estimate plant growth related
   parameters in banana plantations. The information is readily understood
   and, due to the robustness of the technology at a budget price, the
   methodology is a potentially powerful way of generating and providing
   information to local managers of genetic and natural resources as well
   as to owners of commercial plantations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A systematic review on semantic interoperability in the IoE-enabled
   smart cities},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Smart cities have emerged as a result of smart interconnections of
   people, processes, data, and things, representing an excellent case
   study of the Internet of Everything (IoE) paradigm. One of the main
   challenges in realizing the smart city vision is how to provide seamless
   interoperability between the IoE entities. In this paper we conduct a
   systematic literature review on the use of semantic technologies to
   support interoperability between IoE entities in smart cities, with the
   goal of identifying the main trends and challenges in adopting semantic
   interoperability solutions for sustainable, green, and resilient smart
   cities. To this end, we have extracted data from selected primary
   studies over the last decade that address semantic interoperability
   issues in smart cities through related technologies and techniques such
   as ontologies, linked open data, knowledge graphs, ontology
   alignment/matching methods, and automated reasoning mechanisms. We have
   analyzed the maturity of this research area by exploring three research
   questions that focus on: i) the importance of semantic interoperability
   in the smart city domain; ii) the identification of semantic
   technologies and tools applied in the smart city domain to promote
   semantic interoperability; and iii) the identification of smart city
   application areas where semantic technologies are used to efficiently
   deliver smart services. The analysis provided research insights,
   including the introduction of a new evaluation framework that assesses
   semantic interoperability solutions on four maturity levels. The
   framework includes specific evaluation criteria for attributes such as
   modeling, scalability, and availability. Finally, an elaborated list of
   strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of semantic
   interoperability solutions in smart cities is provided, along with a
   discussion of open challenges and future work in this domain.},

   Systematic Review},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being increasingly
   used in the medical field, especially for image recognition in
   high-resolution, large-volume data sets. The study represents the
   current state of research on the application of CNNs in image
   segmentation and pathology detection in spine magnetic resonance
   imaging.METHODS: For this systematic literature review, the authors
   performed a systematic initial search of the PubMed/Medline and Web of
   Science (Core collection) databases for eligible investigations. The
   authors limited the search to observational studies. Outcome parameters
   were analyzed according to the inclusion criteria and assigned to 3
   groups: 1) segmentation of anatomical structures, 2) segmentation and
   evaluation of pathologic structures, and 3) specific implementation of
   CNNs. RESULTS: Twenty-four retrospectively designed articles met the
   inclusion criteria. Publication dates ranged from 2017 to 2021. In
   total, 14,065 patients with 113,110 analyzed images were included. Most
   authors trained their network with a training-to-testing ratio of 80/20,
   while all but 2 articles used 5-to 10-fold cross-validation. Nine
   articles compared their performance results with other neural networks
   and algorithms, and all 24 articles described outcomes as
   positive.CONCLUSIONS: State-of-the-art CNNs can detect and
   segment-specific anatomical landmarks and pathologies across a wide
   range, comparable to the skills of radiologists and experienced
   clinicians. With rapidly evolving network architectures and growing
   medical image databases, the future is likely to show growth in the
   development and refinement of these capable networks. However, the aid
   of automated segmentation and classification by neural net-works cannot
   and should not be expected to replace clinical experts.},

   Frameworks in the Industry Revolution 4.0: A Systematic Literature
   Review},

Abstract = {The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and
   social patterns. Most industries have moved towards automation, and
   human intervention has decreased, which has led to a revolution in
   industries, named the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0).
   Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily
   on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSN). IoT
   and WSN are used in various control systems, including environmental
   monitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection.
   IoT devices and applications are used to process extracted data from WSN
   devices and transmit them to remote locations. This systematic
   literature review offers a wide range of information on Industry 4.0,
   finds research gaps, and recommends future directions. Seven research
   questions are addressed in this article: (i) What are the contributions
   of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions of IoT in IR 4.0?
   (iii) What are the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0? (iv) What are
   the major types of network intruders in WSN and IoT systems? (v) What
   are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT? (vi) What are
   the significant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the
   limitations and research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly
   focuses on research solutions and new techniques to automate Industry
   4.0. In this research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014 until
   2021. This paper covers several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the
   designing phase to security needs, from the deployment stage to the
   classification of the network, the difficulties, challenges, and future
   directions.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review recent health
   economic evaluations (HEEs) of artificial intelligence (AI) applications
   in healthcare. The aim was to discuss pertinent methods, reporting
   quality and challenges for future implementation of AI in healthcare,
   and additionally advise future HEEs.Methods: A systematic literature
   review was conducted in 2 databases (PubMed and Scopus) for articles
   published in the last 5 years. Two reviewers performed independent
   screening, full-text inclusion, data extraction, and appraisal. The
   Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and Philips
   checklist were used for the quality assessment of included
   studies.Results: A total of 884 unique studies were identified; 20 were
   included for full-text review, covering a wide range of medical
   specialties and care pathway phases. The most commonly evaluated type of
   AI was automated medical image analysis models (n = 9, 45\%). The
   prevailing health economic analysis was cost minimization (n = 8, 40\%)
   with the costs saved per case as preferred outcome measure. A total of 9
   studies (45\%) reported model-based HEEs, 4 of which applied a time
   horizon .1 year. The evidence supporting the chosen analytical methods,
   assessment of uncertainty, and model structures was underreported. The
   reporting quality of the articles was moderate as on average studies
   reported on 66\% of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting
   Standards items.Conclusions: HEEs of AI in healthcare are limited and
   often focus on costs rather than health impact. Surprisingly, model
   based long-term evaluations are just as uncommon as model-based
   short-term evaluations. Consequently, insight into the actual benefits
   offered by AI is lagging behind current technological developments.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore the application of existing classifications of
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and associated states in a large
   population sample.
   DESIGN: Prospective cohort study, baseline phase (cross-sectional
   analysis).
   SETTING: Large-scale multicenter study in the United Kingdom.
   PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen thousand four individuals aged 65 and older from
   the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Aging Study. From
   this, a subsample of 2,640 individuals was selected and completed a
   more-detailed cognitive assessment.
   MEASUREMENTS: Information on sociodemographic status, general health,
   cognitive impairment (measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination),
   and functional ability was collected in a structured interview at
   baseline. The Geriatric Mental State Automated Geriatric Examination for
   Computer-Assisted Taxonomy and the Cambridge Cognitive Examination were
   used in assessment to determine cognitive status. Using a systematic
   literature review to collect all symptom classifications for nonnormal
   dementia states, these were then operationalized retrospectively. Each
   participant was classified according to each.
   RESULTS: Population prevalence estimates were variable (range 0.1-42\%),
   reflecting differences in the focus and content of each state. Limited
   overlap existed between states such that many individuals were
   concurrently classified as normal and impaired. This highlights the
   heterogeneity in classification as captured using different definitions.
   CONCLUSION: Classification of cognitively impaired and cognitively
   normal individuals is dependent on the way criteria are defined and
   operationalized. Each classification captures a unique group of
   individuals, with little concordance. Given the importance of early
   detection of dementia and the calls for screening, and recruitment into
   pharmacological trials of cognitively impaired individuals, there is an
   urgent need for an agreed-upon standard MCI case definition to use as a
   criterion standard.},

Title = {The Effects of Technological Developments on Work and Their Implications
   for Continuous Vocational Education and Training: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Technology is changing the way organizations and their employees need to
   accomplish their work. Empirical evidence on this topic is scarce. The
   aim of this study is to provide an overview of the effects of
   technological developments on work characteristics and to derive the
   implications for work demands and continuous vocational education and
   training (CVET). The following research questions are answered: What are
   the effects of new technologies on work characteristics? What are the
   implications thereof for continuous vocational education and training?
   Technologies, defined as digital, electrical or mechanical tools that
   affect the accomplishment of work tasks, are considered in various
   disciplines, such as sociology or psychology. A theoretical framework
   based on theories from these disciplines (e.g., upskilling, task-based
   approach) was developed and statements on the relationships between
   technology and work characteristics, such as complexity, autonomy, or
   meaningfulness, were derived. A systematic literature review was
   conducted by searching databases from the fields of psychology,
   sociology, economics and educational science. Twenty-one studies met the
   inclusion criteria. Empirical evidence was extracted and its
   implications for work demands and CVET were derived by using a model
   that illustrates the components of learning environments. Evidence
   indicates an increase in complexity and mental work, especially while
   working with automated systems and robots. Manual work is reported to
   decrease on many occasions. Workload and workflow interruptions increase
   simultaneously with autonomy, especially with regard to digital
   communication devices. Role expectations and opportunities for
   development depend on how the profession and the technology relate to
   each other, especially when working with automated systems. The
   implications for the work demands necessary to deal with changes in work
   characteristics include knowledge about technology, openness toward
   change and technology, skills for self- and time management and for
   further professional and career development. Implications for the design
   of formal learning environments (i.e., the content, method, assessment,
   and guidance) include that the work demands mentioned must be part of
   the content of the trainings, the teachers/trainers must be equipped to
   promote those work demands, and that instruction models used for the
   learning environments must be flexible in their application.},

Title = {A systematic review of BIM usage for life cycle impact assessment},
Journal = {BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {603-618},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper searches for integration methods proposed by
   different authors that assess the life cycle of a building using models
   of building information modeling (BIM) and it also compares and
   discusses them. Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature review
   (SLR) is selected as the main research method of the present paper,
   aiming to collect and critically analyze multiple research studies. This
   paper is not only limited to studies where the whole life cycle has been
   assessed but also includes other papers which only integrated BIM to
   analyze carbon footprint, embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) or energy
   consumption. Findings Taking into account the countries that have
   published articles about the subject, it is possible to deduce that it
   has been studied in all of the continents, except Africa. In comparison
   with other continents, Asia and Europe have developed more studies.
   Furthermore, 76\% of the 34 selected articles were published in journals
   and only 24\% in conferences proceedings, and the number of papers that
   relates life cycle assessment (LCA) methods using BIM has grown from
   2013 to 2015, proving that the current theme is relevant. Several
   aspects of this literature review show the need to develop automated
   processes for LCA of buildings during the project's development phase.
   There is already a tendency to compare LCA results for buildings applied
   to BIM models, contributing to decision-making related to alternate
   projects, selection of materials, suppliers and components from an
   environmental perspective. Originality/value In the current global
   scenario, it is the notorious negative impact on the environment over
   the years caused by the architecture, engineering and construction
   industry (AEC). The integration of BIM-LCA can reduce time and improve
   the application of environmental analysis. Moreover, the proper
   application of a LCA method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the
   project can be hindered due to lack of information in the database about
   the materials or due to failures in the interoperability between BIM
   software and the LCA tool.},

Title = {The Rising Trends of Smart E-Commerce Logistics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {33839-33857},
Abstract = {Smart Logistics (SL) offers a competitive advantage for e-commerce by
   utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as IoT,
   AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, 5G, etc. This technology automates,
   optimizes, and enables real-time tracking and monitoring of shipments,
   predicts, and prevents delays, and optimizes delivery routes and
   schedules. It also provides greater visibility and control, allowing
   e-commerce businesses to react quickly and efficiently to changes in
   demand or supply. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact
   of digitalization on trade logistics in e-commerce, emphasizing the
   significance of smart logistics for the e-commerce industry. We reviewed
   288 articles published in the last decade in the Scopus database to
   assess the maturity of research in this area. For researchers, this
   study provides a better understanding of smart e-commerce logistics and
   identifies research gaps in the literature. For e-commerce
   professionals, it can help them adopt the latest technological trends in
   their logistics. Through a systematic literature review and network
   analysis approach, the study has contributed by identifying 5 clusters
   related to ICT application fields in e-commerce and 5 clusters related
   to important ICT enablers in smart logistics. We also identified several
   research gaps and areas for future study, including the underutilization
   of computer vision technology and the need for further research on
   product quality inspection and accessibility for people with
   disabilities. Additionally, we suggest exploring the power of deep
   learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and optimizing sensing
   data volume for minimizing costs associated with data storage and
   transfer. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the state of
   the art in smart logistics for e-commerce and serves as a guide for
   future research in this field.},

Title = {Challenges and solutions when adopting DevSecOps: A systematic review},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {141},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context: DevOps (Development and Operations) has become one of the
   fastest-growing software development paradigms in the industry. However,
   this trend has presented the challenge of ensuring secure software
   delivery while maintaining the agility of DevOps. The efforts to
   integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the DevSecOps paradigm,
   which is gaining significant interest from both industry and academia.
   However, the adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a
   challenge. Objective: This study aims to systemize the knowledge about
   the challenges faced by practitioners when adopting DevSecOps and the
   proposed solutions reported in the literature. We also aim to identify
   the areas that need further research in the future. Method: We conducted
   a Systematic Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies. The thematic
   analysis method was applied to analyze the extracted data. Results: We
   identified 21 challenges related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific
   solutions, and the mapping between these findings. We also determined
   key gap areas in this domain by holistically evaluating the available
   solutions against the challenges. The results of the study were
   classified into four themes: People, Practices, Tools, and
   Infrastructure. Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges
   and solutions were the most frequently reported, driven by the need for
   automation in this paradigm. Shift-left security and continuous security
   assessment were two key practices recommended for DevSecOps.
   People-related factors were considered critical for successful DevSecOps
   adoption but less studied. Conclusions: We highlight the need for
   developer-centered application security testing tools that target the
   continuous practices in DevSecOps. More research is needed on how the
   traditionally manual security practices can be automated to suit rapid
   software deployment cycles. Finally, achieving a suitable balance
   between the speed of delivery and security is a significant issue
   practitioners face in the DevSecOps paradigm.},

Title = {Micro-electromechanical systems-based technologies for leak detection
   and localization in water supply networks: A bibliometric and systematic
   review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Leakages from water pipelines cause economic losses and environmental
   hazards. Despite the damages, it is challenging to avoid leaks
   throughout the lifetime. However, leak detection and localization,
   especially in real-time, minimize the damage. Owing to the recent
   advances, the micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) based technologies
   have started to gaining recognition for water network monitoring in
   real-time, however, a systematic literature review to analyze the
   existing research trends, technological advances, and future research
   opportunities are largely missing. This study has based its
   investigation on three main MEMS-based technologies for real-time
   monitoring: MEMS sensors wireless networks, MEMS accelerometers, and
   MEMS hydrophones. Firstly, a scientometric analysis is conducted to 1)
   retrieve relevant research articles through Scopus, Web of Science, and
   Google Scholar, 2) visualize the publication trends, and 3) analyze the
   science mapping of influential authors, countries, organization, and top
   keywords occurrences. Secondly, qualitative discussions are made on
   research themes and sub-themes within three technologies: 1) MEMS WSNs
   are classified into static and mobile sensor-based wireless sensor
   networks. Seven sub-themes are categorized under static sensor-based
   wireless sensor networks such as PIPETECT, whereas three sub-themes are
   categorized under mobile sensor-based WSNs such as TriopusNet; 2) MEMS
   accelerometers are categorized into accelerometers based machine
   learning models and wireless systems; and 3) MEMS hydrophones are
   represented under one category. Thirdly, nine research opportunities
   including automated models, on -field real network based experimental
   studies, optimal placement of sensor nodes for energy savings in
   wireless sensor networks, and a comparative analysis of real-time
   technologies are revealed. This study enhances the familiarity of early
   researchers with the application of MEMS-based technologies for leak
   detection and localization and provides seasoned researchers with a
   platform for future research development.

Title = {Healthcare professionals' organisational barriers to health information
   technologies-A literature review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {80},

Abstract = {Objectives: This literature review identifies and categorises, from an
   organisational management perspective, barriers to the use of HIT or ICT
   for health. Based on the review, it offers policy interventions.
   Methods: This systematic literature review was carried out during
   December 2009 and January 2010. Additional on-going reviews of updates
   through automated system alerts took place up until this paper was
   submitted. A total of thirty-one sources were searched including nine
   software platforms/databases, fifteen specialised websites/targeted
   databases, Google Scholar, ISI Science Citation Index and five journals
   hand-searched.
   Results: The study covers seventy-nine articles on organisational
   barriers to ICT adoption by healthcare professionals. These are
   categorised under five main headings - (I) Structure of healthcare
   organisations; (II) Tasks; (III) People policies; (IV) Incentives; and
   (V) Information and decision processes. A total of ten subcategories are
   also identified. By adopting an organisational management approach, some
   recommendations to remove organisational management barriers are made.
   Conclusions: Despite their apparent promise, health information
   technologies (HIT) have proved difficult to implement. This systematic
   review reveals the implementation barriers associated to organisational
   management and their interrelations. Several important future directions
   in the field are also suggested: (1) there is a need for further
   research providing evidence of HIT cost-effectiveness as well as the
   development of optimal HIT applications; (2) more information is needed
   regarding organisational change, incentives, liability issues, end-users
   HIT competences and skills, structure and work process issues involved
   in realising the benefits from HIT.
   Future policy interventions should consider the five dimensions
   identified when addressing the impact of HIT in healthcare
   organisational systems, and how the impact of an intervention aimed at a
   particular dimension would interrelate with others. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {Timely and accurate evaluation of damage sustained by buildings after
   seismic events such as earthquakes or blasts is critical to determine
   the buildings' safety and suitability for their future occupancy. Time
   used in conducting the evaluations substantially affects the duration
   for which the potentially damaged buildings remain unusable. The elapsed
   time may lead to direct economic losses to both public and private
   owners, and society at large. The presented research investigates the
   application of close-range photogrammetry surveying techniques and
   Augmented Reality (AR) visualization to design a semi-automated method
   for rapidly measuring structural damage induced in tall buildings by
   seismic events such as earthquakes or explosions. Close-range
   photogrammetry algorithms were designed to extract spatial information
   from photographic image data, and geometrically measure the horizontal
   drift (also called interstory drift) sustained at key floors along the
   edge of a damaged building. The measured drift can then be used to
   compute damage indices that correlate the drift to the building's
   structural integrity and safety. In this research, the measurement
   accuracy of the calculated drift using photogrammetry principles is
   particularly studied. The experimental results achieved an acceptable
   and usable accuracy level of 5 mm using a consumer grade digital SLR
   camera, demonstrating the potential of photogrammetry assisted rapid
   measurement of earthquake-induced building damage. It is expected that
   in the future, as advances in optical-sensing and positioning
   technologies continue to make high-end cameras and measurement systems
   (GPS, compass) more affordable, higher accuracy will be practically
   achievable for further improvement in measurements using the proposed
   method.},

Title = {Review of Automated Vulnerability Analysis of Smart Contracts on
   Ethereum},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BLOCKCHAIN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Programs on public blockchains often handle valuable assets, making them
   attractive targets for attack. At the same time, it is challenging to
   design correct blockchain applications. Checking code for potential
   vulnerabilities is a viable option to increase trust. Therefore,
   numerous methods and tools have been proposed with the intention to
   support developers and analysts in detecting code vulnerabilities.
   Moreover, publications keep emerging with different focus, scope, and
   quality, making it difficult to keep up with the field and to identify
   relevant trends. Thus, regular reviews are essential to keep pace with
   the varied developments in a structured manner. Regarding blockchain
   programs, Ethereum is the platform most widely used and best documented.
   Moreover, applications based on Ethereum are entrusted with billions of
   USD. Like on similar blockchains, they are subject to numerous attacks
   and losses due to vulnerabilities that exist at all levels of the
   ecosystem. Countermeasures are in great demand. In this work, we perform
   a systematic literature review (SLR) to assess the state of the art
   regarding automated vulnerability analysis of smart contracts on
   Ethereum with a focus on classifications of vulnerabilities, detection
   methods, security analysis tools, and benchmarks for the assessment of
   tools. Our initial search of the major on-line libraries yields more
   than 1,300 publications. For the review, we apply a clear strategy and
   protocol to assure consequent, comprehensive, and reproducible
   documentation and results. After collecting the initial results,
   cleaning up references, removing duplicates and applying the inclusion
   and exclusion criteria, we retain 303 publications that include 214
   primary studies, 70 surveys and 19 SLRs. For quality appraisal, we
   assess their intrinsic quality (derived from the reputation of the
   publication venue) as well as their contextual quality (determined by
   rating predefined criteria). For about 200 publications with at least a
   medium score, we extract the vulnerabilities, methods, and tools
   addressed, among other data. In a second step, we synthesize and
   structure the data into a classification of both the smart contract
   weaknesses and the analysis methods. Furthermore, we give an overview of
   tools and benchmarks used to evaluate tools. Finally, we provide a
   detailed discussion.},

Title = {Deep learning models and traditional automated techniques for brain
   tumor segmentation in MRI: a review},

Abstract = {Brain is an amazing organ that controls all activities of a human. Any
   abnormality in the shape of anatomical regions of the brain needs to be
   detected as early as possible to reduce the mortality rate. It is also
   beneficial for treatment planning and therapy. The most crucial task is
   to isolate abnormal areas from normal tissue regions. To identify
   abnormalities in the earlier stage, various medical imaging modalities
   were used by medical practitioners as part of the diagnosis. Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool used for
   analyzing the internal structures owing to its capability to provide
   images with high resolution and better contrast for soft tissues. This
   survey focuses on studies done in brain MRI. Manual segmentation of
   abnormal tissues is a time-consuming task, and the performance depends
   on the expert's efficiency. Hence automating tumor segmentation plays a
   vital role in medical imaging applications. This study aims to provide a
   comprehensive survey on recent works developed in brain tumor
   segmentation. In this paper, a systematic literature review is presented
   to the reader to understand three policies, namely classical scheme,
   machine learning strategy, and deep learning methodology meant for tumor
   segmentation. Our primary goal is to include classical methods like
   atlas-based strategy and statistical-based models employed for
   segmenting tumors from brain MRI. Few studies that utilized machine
   learning approaches for the segmentation and classification of brain
   structures are also discussed. After that, the study provides an
   overview of deep learning-based segmentation models for quantitative
   analysis of brain MRI. Deep learning plays a vital role in the automatic
   segmentation of brain tissues. Presently deep learning technique
   outshines traditional statistical methods and machine learning
   approaches. An effort is made to enclose the literature on patch-based
   and semantic-based tissue segmentation presented by researchers working
   in the discipline of medical imaging. The manuscript discusses the basic
   convolutional neural network architecture, Data Sets, and the existing
   deep learning techniques for tissue segmentation coupled with
   classification. This paper also attempts to summarize the current works
   in Convolutional Neural networks and Autoencoders that assist
   researchers in seeking future directions. Finally, this article is
   concluded with possible developments and open challenges in brain tumor
   segmentation.},

Title = {Poster child and guinea pig - insights from a structured literature
   review on Airbnb},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {427-473},
Abstract = {Purpose A growing body of research from various domains has investigated
   Airbnb, a two-sided market platform for peer-based accommodation
   sharing. The authors suggest that it is due time to take a step back and
   assess the current state of affairs. This paper aims to conflate and
   synthesize research on Airbnb.
   Design/methodology/approach To facilitate research on Airbnb and its
   underlying principles in electronic commerce, the authors present a
   structured literature review on Airbnb.
   Findings The findings are based on 118 articles from the fields of
   tourism, information and management, law and economics between 2013 and
   2018. Based on this broad basis, the authors find that: research on
   Airbnb is highly diverse in terms of domains, methods and scope; motives
   for using Airbnb are manifold (e.g. financial, social and
   environmental); trust and reputation are considered crucial by almost
   all scholars; the platform's variety is reflected in prices; and the
   majority of work is based on surveys and empirical data while
   experiments are scarce.
   Practical implications Based on the present assessment of studied
   topics, domains, methods and combinations thereof, the authors suggest
   that research should move toward building atop of a common ground of
   data structures and vocabulary, and that attention should focus on the
   identified gaps and hitherto scarcely used combinations. The set of
   under-represented areas includes cross-cultural investigations, field
   experiments and audit studies, the consideration of dynamic processes
   (e.g. based on panel data), Airbnb's experiences and automated pricing
   algorithms and the rating distribution's skewness.
   Originality/value This study provides a comprehensive overview of work
   on the accommodation sharing platform Airbnb, to the best of the
   auhtors' knowledge, representing the first systematic literature review.
   The authors hope that researchers and practitioners alike will find this
   review useful as a reference for future research on Airbnb and as a
   guide for the development of innovative applications based on the
   platform's peculiarities and paradigms in electronic commerce practice.
   From a practical perspective, the general tenor suggests that hotel and
   tourism operators may benefit from: focusing on their core advantages
   over Airbnb and differentiating features and aligning their marketing
   communication with their users' aspirations.},

Title = {Early survey with bibliometric analysis on machine learning approaches
   in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe
   mortality across the globe, with the USA as the current epicenter of the
   COVID-19 epidemic even though the initial outbreak was in Wuhan, China.
   Many studies successfully applied machine learning to fight COVID-19
   pandemic from a different perspective. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, no comprehensive survey with bibliometric analysis has been
   conducted yet on the adoption of machine learning to fight COVID-19.
   Therefore, the main goal of this study is to bridge this gap by carrying
   out an in-depth survey with bibliometric analysis on the adoption of
   machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 pandemic from a
   different perspective, including an extensive systematic literature
   review and bibliometric analysis.
   Methods: We applied a literature survey methodology to retrieved data
   from academic databases and subsequently employed a bibliometric
   technique to analyze the accessed records. Besides, the concise summary,
   sources of COVID-19 datasets, taxonomy, synthesis and analysis are
   presented in this study. It was found that the Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) is mainly utilized in developing COVID-19 diagnosis and
   prognosis tools, mostly from chest X-ray and chest CT scan images.
   Similarly, in this study, we performed a bibliometric analysis of
   machine learning-based COVID-19 related publications in the Scopus and
   Web of Science citation indexes. Finally, we propose a new perspective
   for solving the challenges identified as direction for future research.
   We believe the survey with bibliometric analysis can help researchers
   easily detect areas that require further development and identify
   potential collaborators.
   Results: The findings of the analysis presented in this article reveal
   that machine learning-based COVID-19 diagnose tools received the most
   considerable attention from researchers. Specifically, the analyses of
   results show that energy and resources are more dispenses towards
   COVID-19 automated diagnose tools while COVID-19 drugs and vaccine
   development remains grossly underexploited. Besides, the machine
   learning-based algorithm that is predominantly utilized by researchers
   in developing the diagnostic tool is CNN mainly from X-rays and CT scan
   images.
   Conclusions: The challenges hindering practical work on the application
   of machine learning-based technologies to fight COVID-19 and new
   perspective to solve the identified problems are presented in this
   article. Furthermore, we believed that the presented survey with
   bibliometric analysis could make it easier for researchers to identify
   areas that need further development and possibly identify potential
   collaborators at author, country and institutional level, with the
   overall aim of furthering research in the focused area of machine
   learning application to disease control.},

Title = {Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment: A Systematic Review on
   Approaches, Tools, Challenges and Practices},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {3909-3943},
Abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and
   deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable
   organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and
   products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous
   practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the
   approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and
   implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically
   reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify
   approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard,
   and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic
   literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on
   continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied
   the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from
   reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have
   identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the
   implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: 1)
   reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); 2)
   increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; 3)
   supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; 4) detecting
   violations, flaws, and faults in CI; 5) addressing security and
   scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and 6) improving
   dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also
   determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and
   time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles,
   customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and
   appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when
   introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority
   of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%)
   research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have
   been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects.
   Continuous practices have become an important area of software
   engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools,
   and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are
   several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for
   improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the
   studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a
   deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-)
   architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of
   knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running
   secure deployment pipelines.},

Title = {A study on application programming interface recommendation:
   state-of-the-art techniques, challenges and future directions},
Journal = {LIBRARY HI TECH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},
Pages = {355-385},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to identify the developer's objectives, current
   state-of-the-art techniques, challenges and performance evaluation
   metrics, and presents outlines of a knowledge-based application
   programming interfaces (API) recommendation system for the developers.
   Moreover, the current study intends to classify current state-of-the-art
   techniques supporting automated API recommendations.
   Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors have performed a
   systematic literature review of studies, which have been published
   between the years 2004-2021 to achieve the targeted research objective.
   Subsequently, the authors performed the analysis of 35 primary studies.
   Findings The outcomes of this study are: (1) devising a thematic
   taxonomy based on the identified developers' challenges, where
   mashup-oriented APIs and time-consuming process are frequently
   encountered challenges by the developers; (2) categorizing current
   state-of-the-art API recommendation techniques (i.e. clustering
   techniques, data preprocessing techniques, similarity measurements
   techniques and ranking techniques); (3) designing a taxonomy based on
   the identified objectives, where accuracy is the most targeted objective
   in API recommendation context; (4) identifying a list of evaluation
   metrics employed to assess the performance of the proposed techniques;
   (5) performing a SWOT analysis on the selected studies; (6) based on the
   developer's challenges, objectives and SWOT analysis, presenting
   outlines of a recommendation system for the developers and (7)
   delineating several future research dimensions in API recommendations
   context. Research limitations/implications This study provides complete
   guidance to the new researcher in the context of API recommendations.
   Also, the researcher can target these objectives (accuracy, response
   time, method recommendation, compatibility, user requirement-based API,
   automatic service recommendation and API location) in the future.
   Moreover, the developers can overcome the identified challenges
   (including mashup-oriented API, Time-consuming process, learn how to use
   the API, integrated problem, API method usage location and limited usage
   of code) in the future by proposing a framework or recommendation
   system. Furthermore, the classification of current state-of-the-art API
   recommendation techniques also helps the researchers who wish to work in
   the future in the context of API recommendation. Practical implications
   This study not only facilitates the researcher but also facilitates the
   practitioners in several ways. The current study guides the developer in
   minimizing the development time in terms of selecting relevant APIs
   rather than following traditional manual selection. Moreover, this study
   facilitates integrating APIs in a project. Thus, the recommendation
   system saves the time for developers, and increases their productivity.
   Originality/value API recommendation remains an active area of research
   in web and mobile-based applications development. The authors believe
   that this study acts as a useful tool for the interested researchers and
   practitioners as it will contribute to the body of knowledge in API
   recommendations context.},

Title = {Automated estimation of foliage cover in forest understorey from digital
   nadir images},
Journal = {METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Pages = {405-415},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Understorey vegetation can contribute significantly to the foliage
   cover and gas exchange of forest and impact the accuracy of
   remotely-sensed vegetation indices. Visual assessment is a rapid means
   of estimating cover, but its drawbacks include bias and inconsistency
   between observers and observation periods and the inability of observers
   to distinguish between cover intervals smaller than 10\%. The accuracy
   of visual assessment is unlikely to be able to reliably detect changes
   smaller than 10\%. Hence, there is a need for rapid and accurate
   alternatives for estimating understorey cover in forests. 2. Nadir
   (downward facing) photography is an alternative method that has been
   applied successfully in agriculture but not tested in forests. Detection
   of green foliage in images of forest understorey is far more challenging
   than in images of agricultural crops owing to the heterogeneity of the
   vegetation, the background and the lighting conditions. We tested
   several image analysis approaches to classifying and quantifying foliage
   cover in images taken from a height of 3-4 m above the ground using a
   digital SLR camera on an extendible pole. To reduce the impact of
   lighting variations on image processing, we converted red, green and
   blue (RGB) digital numbers from the RGB image to green leaf
   algorithm(GLA) values and to the CIE L{*} a{*} b{*} colourmodel prior to
   analysis. 3. The most successful classification method (LAB2) utilised
   the GLA, a{*} and b{*} values of each pixel to classify green vegetation
   using a minimum-distance-to-means classifier. Ahistogram-corner
   detection method (Rosin) was superior to other methods when cover was <
   10\%. Between-class variance methods were the least accurate methods.
   Owing to the spectral complexity of the forest floor, it was necessary
   to filter noise from the classified images. Further work is needed to
   separate shades of gray from hues of green in images with sparse cover
   and coarse woody debris. 4. Synthesis and Applications. We propose that
   the LAB2 method be used to quantify foliage cover in nadir images of
   understorey with cover > 10\% but that the Rosin method be used for
   cover < 10\%. The automated methodology that we have developed yields
   estimates of foliage cover in forest understorey from digital
   photography that are rapid, objective and at least as accurate as visual
   assessment (i. e. within 5\%). User intervention is limited to quality
   control. The improved method could be extended to indirect estimation of
   leaf area index for studies of forest water balance and productivity.},

Title = {AI and public contests: a model to improve the evaluation and selection
   of public contest candidates in the Police Force},
Journal = {TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {627-648},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Purpose The number of candidates applying to public contests (PC) is
   increasing compared to the number of human resources employees required
   for selecting them for the Police Force (PF). This work intends to
   perceive how those public institutions can evaluate and select their
   candidates efficiently during the different phases of the recruitment
   process. To achieve this purpose, artificial intelligence (AI) was
   studied. This paper aims to focus on analysing the AI technologies most
   used and appropriate to the PF as a complementary recruitment strategy
   of the National Criminal Investigation police agency of Portugal -
   Policia Judiciaria. Design/methodology/approach Using design science
   research as a methodological approach, the authors suggest a theoretical
   framework in pair with the segmentation of the candidates and comprehend
   the most important facts facing public institutions regarding the usage
   of AI technologies to make decisions about evaluating and selecting
   candidates. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic
   reviews and meta-analyses methodology guidelines, a systematic
   literature review and meta-analyses method was adopted to identify how
   the usage and exploitation of transparent AI positively impact the
   recruitment process of a public institution, resulting in an analysis of
   34 papers between 2017 and 2021. Findings Results suggest that the
   conceptual pairing of evaluation and selection problems of candidates
   who apply to PC with applicable AI technology such as K-means,
   hierarchical clustering, artificial neural network and convolutional
   neural network algorithms can support the recruitment process and could
   help reduce the workload in the entire process while maintaining the
   standard of responsibility. The combination of AI and human
   decision-making is a fair, objective and unbiased process emphasising a
   decision-making process free of nepotism and favouritism when carefully
   developed. Innovative and modern as a category, group the statements
   that emphasise the innovative and contemporary nature of the process.
   Research limitations/implications There are two main limitations in this
   study that should be considered. Firstly, the difficulty regarding the
   timetable, privacy and legal issues associated with public institutions.
   Secondly, a small group of experts served as the validation group for
   the new framework. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted
   to alleviate this constraint. They provide additional insights into an
   interviewee's opinions and beliefs. Social implications Ensure that the
   system is fair, transparent and facilitates their application process.
   Originality/value The main contribution is the AI-based theoretical
   framework, applicable within the analysis of literature papers, focusing
   on the problem of how the institutions can gain insights about their
   candidates while profiling them, how to obtain more accurate information
   from the interview phase and how to reach a more rigorous assessment of
   their emotional intelligence providing a better alignment of moral
   values. This work aims to improve the decision-making process of a PF
   institution recruiter by turning it into a more automated and
   evidence-based decision when recruiting an adequate candidate for the
   job vacancy.},

Title = {A comprehensive look at Greenwashing from 1996 to 2021: a bibliometric
   analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {157-186},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to see how scholarly research on Greenwashing
   practices and behaviour has progressed in the 21st century. There has
   been a lot of empirical, exploratory and conceptual work done on Green
   marketing, sustainable marketing and environmental marketing. However,
   there have been few attempts to produce a comprehensive scientific
   mapping of Greenwashing as a niche topic. As a result, the study's goal
   is to elicit research trends through knowledge structure synthesis.
   Design/methodology/approach A Bibliometric Analysis on the topic of
   Greenwashing practices was undertaken on 355 publications. For this, a
   scientific search strategy was run on the Scopus database for the period
   1996-2021. The study was conducted using Biblioshiny, a Web-based
   application that is part of the Bibliometric package. Important
   journals, countries, authors, keywords and affiliations were found using
   the software's automated workflow and thematic evolution, citations,
   co-citations and social network analysis were performed. Findings The
   study indicated a gradual increase in the research related to
   Greenwashing practices. The findings show a relative concentration of
   more influential work in the said domain amongst a handful of research
   scholars. Many influential studies have occurred after 2007, and a rally
   is seen in the studies on Greenwashing till 2020. The authors can say
   that the rigour of research has started increasing since then.
   Geographic dispersion of the work has shown that the USA followed by the
   UK dominates the scholarly inquiry and these countries have major
   collaboration with European and Asian researchers. The 10 most
   productive countries were examined, and it was discovered that the USA
   contributed the majority of the publications, with the UK and China
   coming in second and third place, respectively, in terms of publication
   in the said sector. In addition to the domain's conceptual structure,
   the study exposes the domain's social and Intellectual structure. This
   brings up new possibilities for Greenwashing studies in the future.
   Research limitations/implications The present research is a Bibliometric
   analysis that is restricted to science mapping, and hence, limitations
   apply to the said studies. Researchers can use systematic literature
   review to build a robust conceptual foundation in the future. The Scopus
   database was used for this study because it has a greater number of
   high-quality journals in structured forms that are compatible with
   Bibliometrix software. Practical implications Greenwashing practices and
   behaviour, as well as their links to sustainability, are discussed in
   this paper. It highlights the most often stated challenges in the
   discipline and suggests possible research topics. It provides future
   scholars with information on this discipline's issues, contexts and
   collaboration opportunities. Social implications The current study can
   give further directions to the researchers for conducting rigorous
   research on Greenwashing behaviour and practices and will guide the
   policymakers to formulate policies in the field of non-sustainable
   activities, with Greenwashing being one of them. Originality/value A lot
   of work is done by the scientific community in Green marketing research,
   and a lot of literature is available on Green and Sustainable marketing
   practices. However, there is still a need felt for more extensive and
   rigorous research on the evolution of Greenwashing methods.
   This study makes a significant addition in that it brings together the
   scattered literature in the field, focuses on important sources, authors
   and documents, and investigates Greenwashing techniques and behaviour,
   which is the other side of the sustainable practices coin.},
