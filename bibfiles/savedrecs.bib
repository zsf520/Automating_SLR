Abstract = {Hackathon as a social event has been identified as a method that assists
   participants collaborate and solve technical design challenges in a
   limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance
   in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for
   teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for
   some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited
   to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to
   investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the
   academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research
   was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South
   African IT programming students. The results indicate that relative
   advantage (beta = 0.142, rho = 0.045), perceived usefulness (beta =
   0.205, rho = 0.036), performance expectancy (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.002)
   and self-efficacy (beta = 0.330, rho = 0.000) have a positive influence
   on the behavioural intention of students to adopt hackathon for learning
   IT programming. The hackathon adoption model was developed for higher
   education. This research helps in the adoption of hackathons in higher
   education.},

Abstract = {Background Hackathons aim to develop solutions to preidentified problem
   domains and catalyse startup cultures. Recently, the teaching and
   learning potential of hackathons has also been documented. In this
   study, we make the case for utilisation of hackathons as an alternative
   teaching and learning tool geared towards entrepreneurship and as an
   opportunity for interprofessional integration.
   Methods This research study followed up with participants from the third
   hackathon at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. Hack MedEd
   was about solutions to problems of undergraduate and postgraduate
   medical education with an emphasis on low--income to middle-income
   countries. Participant evaluation data were filled at the end of the
   hackathon and gathered from three focused group discussions (FGDs):
   immediately before and after the event, a delayed follow-up after 11
   months was recorded.
   Results Of 116 participants, the majority (71\%) were under 30 years
   old, and over half were female. The evaluations provided by hackers were
   positive overall with a mean score of 4.37 out of 5 on a Likert Scale.
   During the FGDs, participants spoke positively of the process and felt
   that, by the end of the hackathon, they had learnt something new. In the
   delayed follow-up FGD, teams that had undergone incubation expressed
   that they had gained a critical and simple skillset that they might not
   have acquired otherwise.
   Conclusion Hackathons business incubation programmes may be considered
   an alternative teaching and learning tool-especially for individuals
   studying or working within the healthcare discipline within
   low--resource settings.},

Abstract = {A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer
   hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by
   problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop
   creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the
   evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed
   practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57)
   developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented
   in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5),
   evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The
   evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon
   promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of
   concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged
   were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred
   that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More
   research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of
   social work curricula including the teaching of various research
   methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work
   profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt
   social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and
   e-consultation might benefit from Hackathon brainstorming.},

Title = {Hackathons: what do engineering educators think about it?},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Pages = {983-1001},
Month = {OCT 12},
Abstract = {Purpose With past studies indicating a lack of skill development in
   engineering education, there is a need for new pedagogical tools that
   are application and skill-oriented. Hackathons are widely accepted in
   the corporate world, in the engineering domain for skill development and
   recruitment but have not gained acceptance in mainstream engineering
   education. Very few studies have discussed engineering educator views
   regarding hackathons and their benefits. This paper intends to study
   engineering educators' perception of the hackathon and its benefits
   after participating in it. The findings could support hackathons as a
   pedagogical tool to develop an industry-oriented and skill-based
   engineering education. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods
   design was employed where initially qualitative study was conducted. Its
   findings were used to conduct survey of 162 engineering educators who
   had participated in a hackathon. A five point Likert scale was employed
   for data collection. Findings The findings reveal that engineering
   educators who participated in the hackathon perceived hackathons to
   support industry-focused learning, problem-solving and new skill
   development. They also acknowledged its role in their professional
   development. The further discussion suggests that engineering educators
   and institutes may collaborate with industry to design and use
   hackathons as a teaching tool to develop industry-ready graduates.
   Research limitations/implications The study was not designed to study
   how different aspects of hackathon lead to different benefits derived
   from participating in it. There is a need to study hackathons as a tool
   of pedagogy and assessment, focusing on how variables linked to it
   facilitate, moderate and hinder the learning and assessment process in
   participants. More in-depth studies need to be conducted to adopt the
   hackathon as a pedagogy and assessment tool in higher education.
   Practical implications The discussion suggests that designing hackathons
   effectively as a tool for learning and skill development will result in
   skilled graduates. Engineering educators should adopt hackathons as a
   pedagogy for their students. Management and policymakers of engineering
   institutes should consider hackathons as a part of pedagogy for students
   besides conducting hackathons for educators for their professional
   development that will be investment in skills helpful at workplace.
   Originality/value The notable contribution of this paper is to document
   perceptions of engineering educators regarding hackathons and their
   benefits after participating in a hackathon. The paper proposes that
   hackathons can be introduced in the engineering curriculum as they would
   offer educators a novel method of teaching and assessment and support
   engineering graduates in recruitment and making them industry-ready.},

Title = {An Extended Hackathon Model for Collaborative Education in Medical
   Innovation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To support the next generation of healthcare innovators - whether they
   be engineers, designers, clinicians, or business experts by training -
   education in the emerging field of medical innovation should be made
   easily and widely accessible to undergraduate students, graduate
   students, and young professionals, early in their careers. Currently,
   medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or
   year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a
   limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure
   and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that
   seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible
   and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended
   hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245
   participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016,
   2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo
   Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to
   self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were
   administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants
   hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of
   expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161)
   saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1\%, P<0.001) from their pre-
   to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is
   presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and
   graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation.
   Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten
   categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of
   extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation
   knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of
   participants surveyed.},

Title = {Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease
   Outbreaks Through Hackathons},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is
   one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of
   teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from
   this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching
   topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period
   of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the
   essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in
   controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally
   do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a
   critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate
   engineering students about public health without interfering with
   required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons,
   short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an
   engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge
   of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the
   effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of
   engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application
   Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were
   engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused
   hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was
   assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre-
   and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the
   hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering
   students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an
   increased understanding of public health professions and how they can
   contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore,
   hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering
   students about topics outside of their discipline.},

Abstract = {A Health Hackathon provides an opportunity for healthcare professionals
   to collaborate with IT developers and designers to solve health issues
   using technology and thus serves as a potential venue for
   interprofessional education. The present paper reports the views and
   experiences of participants on how the KKU mHealth Hackathon 2017 served
   as a venue for interprofessional education. A phenomenological approach
   was used involving semi-structured in-depth interviews of three faculty
   members and three students who participated in the hackathon.
   Participants expressed their learning experiences during the event, as
   well as factors that promoted or hindered learning. Our findings suggest
   that a health hackathon can serve as a suitable venue for
   interprofessional education as interviewees reported how they had learnt
   to successfully collaborate in interprofessional teams, move beyond
   their prior views and appreciate complementary work from other
   professions, focus on solving problems practically, and create a
   collegial, collaborative atmosphere. There were also some potential
   downsides of the hackathon that could be solved with an improved design
   in future occasions. A Health Hackathon can be an important opportunity
   for interprofessional education. Further studies should focus on methods
   to reproduce these positive learning experiences, mitigate the negative
   aspects, and investigate their long-term effects.},

Title = {The Effects of Hackathons on the Entrepreneurial Skillset and Perceived
   Self-Efficacy as Factors Shaping Entrepreneurial Intentions},
Journal = {ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Purpose: While traditional university programs primarily use regularly
   scheduled classes as the primary means for developing students, this
   program evaluation explores the direct effects of intensive
   entrepreneurial learning activity in the format of a hackathon. This is
   one of the first papers to explore the learning outcomes of hackathons
   as an intensive entrepreneurial pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach:
   The researchers implemented a pre-test/post-test model with students
   participating in an entrepreneurship hackathon and tested the changes in
   their confidence levels in the ability to craft a successful
   entrepreneurial venture. Findings: The results support a hackathon model
   of entrepreneurial learning. As the result of a one-day workshop,
   significant results were achieved for self-reported ability in
   identifying a viable entrepreneurial concept, and for having the ability
   to successfully launch a new venture. Further, class standing and prior
   entrepreneurial courses, as well as gender did not influence the
   learning outcomes. Importantly, while hackathon-generated increases in
   entrepreneurial self-efficacy proved to be statistically significant,
   same gains proved not to be significant in a traditional
   entrepreneurship class setting. Authors conclude that short, intensive
   entrepreneurship learning methods like hackathons may be more effective
   in developing entrepreneurial self-efficacy than semester long courses.
   Originality/value: A hackathon is likely an effective entrepreneurial
   learning methodology suitable for a general student population which
   includes students with limited knowledge of and interest in
   entrepreneurship. The usefulness of a hackathon for entrepreneurial
   learning has potential implications for educators, scholars and policy
   makers. For educators, a hackathon approach may outperform a number of
   traditional entrepreneurship pedagogies in the form of lectures, case
   studies, class discussions or even a business plan development over a
   semester-long course. A hackathon may also allow students to gain
   entrepreneurial skills and self-confidence much quicker and using less
   resources than in a traditional entrepreneurial course. The potential
   reasons for these findings as well as their implications are discussed
   along with future research areas.},

   the crowdsourcing mechanism to enable open innovation under the
   constraint of physical distancing. This study contributes to the
   research by introducing and conceptualizing a modified artifact -
   virtual hackathon. The implication of and the lessons learnt from the
   virtual hackathon are applicable and generalizable to organizations when

Abstract = {Hackathon-style events are increasingly used to facilitate

   Based on an observational study of a hackathon organized as part of the
   film festival Nordic Panorama (NP) we analyse the challenges in using
   the hackathon format to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning and
   innovation for filmmakers, developers and designers. We find that many
   participants experienced frustrations resulting from a lack of
   programming skills and their expectation that the hackathon should
   result in something digital'. Additionally, ideals for authorship
   embedded in the working cultures of film and TV professionals impeded
   the team's ability to involve all participants on an equal footing. As
   implications for future hackathons we suggest organizers should consider
   using tools for end-user development and generative toolkits to
   facilitate digital making and collaborative learning. We also suggest
   similar events should avoid including project owners if the group work
   is based on existing projects.},

Title = {Fostering interdisciplinary working within global surgery at an
   undergraduate level: A hackathon based approach},
Journal = {SURGERY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {26-31},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual hackathon in
   fostering interdisciplinary working amongst undergraduate students in
   global surgery.
   Methodology: In this study, we developed a 3 day event consisting of
   guest lectures, a documentary screening and a hackathon supported by
   academics and experts in the field, to provide students with the
   opportunity to learn more about and work in interdisciplinary teams
   within global surgery. Students had the option to attend just the
   lectures or both the lectures and hackathon. Quantitative and
   qualitative results were collected through a pre and post session
   survey.
   Results: A total of 21 responses were received for the hackathon and 26
   responses for the general event (response rate for event = 26 \%,
   response rate for hackathon = 24.7 \%). There was a significant
   improvement in understanding of interdisciplinary working in global
   surgery between the pre and post-session survey, with an increase in
   median from 3 (IQR = 2-3.5, n = 21) to 4 (IQR = 4-5, n = 21) (p < 0.05).
   Respondents noted that the benefits of a hackathon were that it was very
   engaging, and brought in diversity of thought and expertise. The
   drawbacks to the hackathon were that it was fast-paced, required prior
   knowledge and the virtual platform it was hosted on.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that hackathons are an effective,
   inclusive and equitable way for students to engage in and learn about
   interdisciplinary working. It is important that as institutions
   recognise and develop global surgery courses, these courses reflect the
   interdisciplinary nature of the field.},

Abstract = {Background
   Steering planetary and human health towards a more sustainable future
   demands educated and prepared health professionals.
   Aim
   This research aimed: to explore health professions educators'
   sustainable healthcare education (SHE) knowledge, attitudes,
   self-efficacy and teaching practices across 13 health professions
   courses in one Australian university.
   Methods
   Utilising a sequential mixed-methods design: Phase one (understanding)
   involved an online survey to ascertain educators' SHE knowledge,
   attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices to inform phase two
   (solution generation), `Teach Green' Hackathon. Survey data was
   descriptively analysed and a gap analysis performed to promote
   generation of solutions during phase two. Results from the hackathon
   were thematically analysed to produce five recommendations.
   Results
   Regarding SHE, survey data across 13 health professions disciplines (n =
   163) identified strong content knowledge (90.8\%); however, only
   (36.9\%) reported confidence to `explain' and (44.2\%) to `inspire'
   students. Two thirds of participants (67.5\%) reported not knowing how
   best to teach SHE. Hackathon data revealed three main influencing
   factors: regulatory, policy and socio-cultural drivers.
   Conclusions
   The five actionable recommendations to strengthen interdisciplinary
   capacity to integrate SHE include: inspire multi-level leadership and
   collaboration; privilege student voice; develop a SHE curriculum and
   resources repository; and integrate SHE into course accreditation
   standards.},

Abstract = {Objective: Machine learning in healthcare, and innovative healthcare
   technology in general, require complex interactions within
   multidisciplinary teams. Healthcare hackathons are being increasingly
   used as a model for cross-disciplinary collaboration and learning. The
   aim of this study is to explore high school student learning experiences
   during a healthcare hackathon. By optimizing their learning experiences,
   we hope to prepare a future workforce that can bridge technical and
   health fields and work seamlessly across disciplines.
   Methods: A qualitative exploratory study utilizing focus group
   interviews was conducted. Eight high school students from the hackathon
   were invited to participate in this study through convenience sampling
   Participating students (n = 8) were allocated into three focus groups.
   Semi structured interviews were completed, and transcripts evaluated
   using inductive thematic analysis.
   Findings: Through the structured analysis of focus group transcripts
   three major themes emerged from the data: (1) Collaboration, (2)
   Transferable knowledge and skills, and (3) Expectations about
   hackathons. These themes highlight strengths and potential barriers when
   bringing this multidisciplinary approach to high school students and the
   healthcare community.
   Conclusion: This study found that students were empowered by the
   interdisciplinary experience during a hackathon and felt that the
   knowledge and skills gained could be applied in real world settings.
   However, addressing student expectations of hackathons prior to the
   event is an area for improvement. These findings have implications for
   future hackathons and can spur further research into using the hackathon
   model as an educational experience for learners of all ages.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the opportunities of leveraging a hackathon
   format to empower citizens by increasing their abilities to use open
   data to improve their neighbourhoods and communities. The presented
   discussion is grounded in five civic hackathon case studies organised in
   five European cities. The research revealed specialised learning and
   collaborative alignment as two mutually complementary aspects of the
   involved learning processes, which were achieved with the help of
   high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes, respectively. Consequently,
   the paper identifies and discusses three main factors required to
   sustain social learning ecosystems beyond hackathon events, and with the
   purpose of democratising smart city services. These factors include a)
   supporting individuals in obtaining specific expert knowledge and
   skills, b) nurturing data-literate activist communities of practice made
   up of citizens with complementary expert skillsets, and c) enabling
   members of these communities to generate prototypes of open-data
   services of varying fidelity.},

   Past 20 Years: A Scoping Review},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {Experiential learning is an effective method to teach User Experience
   (UX) to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Despite its
   popularity, there seems to be no comprehensive overview on (1) the
   current use of experiential learning in UX education at universities and
   (2) student learning outcomes and benefits resulting from the use of
   experiential learning. Hence, we conducted a scoping review to provide
   such overview. We analyzed 45 articles published from 2000 to 2021 and
   we found 12 types of experiential learning employed by HCI educators:
   applied research project, industry/community research project, hands-on
   activity, role-play, interactive workshops, guest speakers, in-house
   work placement, internship, flipped classroom, field project, lab, and
   design hackathon, from most to least frequent. Twenty-six articles
   reported student learning outcomes and benefits: (1) enhanced UX
   technical knowledge, (2) applied textbook knowledge into practice, (3)
   acquired soft skills, (4) student satisfaction, (5) increased awareness
   of user diversity, and (6) increased job marketability. Overall, we
   advance current HCI teaching practices by providing HCI educators with a
   list of experiential learning types that they can adopt in their classes
   to teach UX.},

Title = {Design at hackathons: new opportunities for design research},
Journal = {DESIGN SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {Hackathons are short-term events at which participants work in small
   groups to ideate, develop and present a solution to a problem. Despite
   their popularity, and significant relevance to design research, they
   have only recently come into research focus. This study presents a
   review of the existing literature on the characteristics of designing at
   hackathons. Hackathon participants are found to follow typical
   divergence-convergence patterns in their design process throughout the
   hackathon. Unique features include the initial effort to form teams and
   the significant emphasis on preparing and delivering a solution demo at
   the final pitch. Therefore, hackathons present themselves as a unique
   setting in which design is conducted and learned, and by extension, can
   be studied. Overall, the review provides a foundation to inform future
   research on design at hackathons. Methodological limitations of current
   studies on hackathons are discussed and the feasibility of more
   systematic studies of design in these types of settings is assessed.
   Further, we explore how the unique nature of the hackathon format and
   the diverse profiles of hackathon participants with regards to subject
   matter knowledge, design expertise and prior hackathon experience may
   affect design cognition and behaviour at each stage of the design
   process in distinctive ways.},

Title = {H3ABioNet genomic medicine and microbiome data portals hackathon
   proceedings},
Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},
Year = {2021},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {African genomic medicine and microbiome datasets are usually not well
   characterized in terms of their origin, making it difficult to find and
   extract data for specific African ethnic groups or even countries. The
   Pan-African H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) recognized the
   need for developing data portals for African genomic medicine and
   African microbiomes to address this and ran a hackathon to initiate
   their development. The two portals were designed and significant
   progress was made in their development during the hackathon. All the
   participants worked in a very synergistic and collaborative atmosphere
   in order to achieve the hackathon's goals. The participants were divided
   into content and technical teams and worked over a period of 6 days. In
   response to one of the survey questions of what the participants liked
   the most during the hackathon, 55\% of the hackathon participants
   highlighted the familial and friendly atmosphere, the team work and the
   diversity of team members and their expertise. This paper describes the
   preparations for the portals hackathon and the interaction between the
   participants and reflects upon the lessons learned about its impact on
   successfully developing the two data portals as well as building
   scientific expertise of younger African researchers.},

Journal = {STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {233-272},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Research Summary Software platforms create value by cultivating an
   ecosystem of complementary products and services. Existing explanations
   for how a prospective complementor chooses platforms to join assume the
   complementor has rich information about the range of available
   platforms. However, complementors lack this information in many
   ecosystems, raising the question of how complementors learn about
   platforms in the first place. We investigate whether attending a
   temporary gathering-a hackathon-impacts the platform choices of software
   developers. Through a large-scale quantitative study of 1,302 developers
   and 167 hackathons, supported by qualitative research, we analyze the
   multiple channels-sponsorship, social learning, knowledge exchange, and
   social coordination-through which hackathons serve as a social forum for
   the diffusion of platform adoption among attendees. Managerial Summary A
   software platform such as Windows, iOS, or Amazon Web Services relies on
   third-party developers to create applications that complement the
   platform and make it valuable for end users. However, developers face a
   wide range of possible platforms, and they may have limited information
   about which platforms would be worthwhile to develop for. A software
   platform business can educate and encourage developers to adopt their
   platform by supporting in-person software development competitions,
   known as hackathons. Developers learn about prospective platforms that
   advertise at the hackathon. Developers also learn whether and how to use
   a platform by observing and teaching one other. Hackathons are
   particularly useful for spreading platform technologies: developers
   prefer to adopt widely used platforms, and hackathons permit developers
   to identify and join fashionable platforms.},

Title = {Motivating innovative education methods with hackathon attendance},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 10},
Abstract = {Hackathon has been growing and taking various industries by storm thanks
   to its flexibility and ability to fit into them. It has been proven
   successful and helpful in solving different IT and non-IT challenges.
   They also serve as an intriguing educational and networking tool,
   encouraging people to pursue innovative studies and activities. However,
   a hackathon is like a two-edged sword with its downsides - it requires
   significant investment and can fail if mismanaged. It is critical to
   recruit and gather participants suitable to face a particular
   technological or non-technological challenge and to motivate a group to
   perform innovative action and benefit from the learning-by-doing
   approach. This paper identifies 21 reasons to attend hackathons backed
   by existing research and presents a study conducted on 109 hackathon
   participants that help to score, rank and explain those attributes.
   Results have proven the importance of challenge and networking over
   monetary prizes and glory.},

Title = {Employing Technology Industry Methods to Facilitate Transformative
   Learning Experiences in the Classroom: Insights From a Pilot},

Abstract = {High-impact, transformative educational practices change the way
   students see themselves and others, as well as impart knowledge.
   Practices from the technology industry may offer innovative strategies
   for fostering transformational learning experiences. We developed and
   implemented two innovation techniques-Hackathon and Innovation Time Off
   (ITO)-in a graduate course on social psychology and public health
   nutrition. The Hackathon occurred in the sixth and seventh weeks of the
   course; the last 4 weeks provided 10\% of class time for ITO projects.
   All enrolled students participated in the pilot study (n = 6; M age =
   27.5 years; 83\% female; 67\% White) and completed reflection papers
   during the final exam period. Student learning was assessed from these
   reflection papers using a rubric for transformative versus
   nontransformative changes in five areas: confidence, pride, skills,
   perspective, and identity. Student responses revealed transformative
   changes in perspective (n = 7). Additionally, nontransformative changes
   were found in confidence (n = 1), identity (n = 2), perspective (n = 4),
   and skills (n = 9). This pilot work suggests that the Hackathon and ITO
   contributed to perceived skill-building in problem-solving and teamwork,
   and the Hackathon may have led to transformative changes in perspective;
   ITO may not be appropriate for learners who need structure; high
   confidence remained unchanged; and these strategies are likely to be
   feasible and replicable.},

Abstract = {Despite originating in the tech industry, hackathons have now been
   adopted in a variety of domains. However, little is known about the
   status of hackathon literature within educational research. As the
   number of studies grows, it is essential to develop an understanding of
   the current state and identify prevalent topics and trends shaping the
   literature. Toward this goal, this study conducted a bibliometric
   analysis and scoping review on hackathon research in the field of
   education. A total of 249 documents written by 1,309 authors and
   published in 180 unique sources for the period 2014-2022 were
   identified. Collectively, the dataset amassed 1,312 citations with an
   average of 6.69 citations per document. The most prevalent subject areas
   were computer science, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and
   business. Word frequency analysis showed that ``innovation{''} was the
   most occurring word, which represents the fundamental objective of
   hackathon events. The most influential work was the analysis of
   hackathons as an informal learning platform. Engineering education was
   the most trending topic while healthcare is an emerging research
   cluster. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the
   hackathon literature and its research landscape in an educational
   setting.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence and medical education: A global mixed-methods
   study of medical students' perspectives},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objective Medical students, as clinicians and healthcare leaders of the
   future, are key stakeholders in the clinical roll-out of artificial
   intelligence-driven technologies. The authors aim to provide the first
   report on the state of artificial intelligence in medical education
   globally by exploring the perspectives of medical students. Methods The
   authors carried out a mixed-methods study of focus groups and surveys
   with 128 medical students from 48 countries. The study explored
   knowledge around artificial intelligence as well as what students wished
   to learn about artificial intelligence and how they wished to learn
   this. A combined qualitative and quantitative analysis was used. Results
   Support for incorporating teaching on artificial intelligence into core
   curricula was ubiquitous across the globe, but few students had received
   teaching on artificial intelligence. Students showed knowledge on the
   applications of artificial intelligence in clinical medicine as well as
   on artificial intelligence ethics. They were interested in learning
   about clinical applications, algorithm development, coding and algorithm
   appraisal. Hackathon-style projects and multidisciplinary education
   involving computer science students were suggested for incorporation
   into the curriculum. Conclusions Medical students from all countries
   should be provided teaching on artificial intelligence as part of their
   curriculum to develop skills and knowledge around artificial
   intelligence to ensure a patient-centred digital future in medicine.
   This teaching should focus on the applications of artificial
   intelligence in clinical medicine. Students should also be given the
   opportunity to be involved in algorithm development. Students in low-
   and middle-income countries require the foundational technology as well
   as robust teaching on artificial intelligence to ensure that they can
   drive innovation in their healthcare settings.},

Abstract = {Hackathons and hackathon-like events are gaining significant popularity
   as extra-curricular events among engineering undergraduate students.
   While not always explicitly promoted as such, these events provide
   participants with exposure to, and experience in design. Not

   a novel design pedagogy in engineering, increasingly in curricular
   settings. In this paper we review several examples of hackathons as a

Title = {Consider ``HACKS{''} when designing hackathon challenges: Hook, action,
   collaborative knowledge sharing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Our world's complex challenges increase the need for those entering
   STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) disciplines to
   be able to creatively approach and collaboratively address wicked
   problems - complex problems with no ``right `` answer that span
   disciplines. Hackathons are environments that leverage problem-based
   learning practices so student teams can solve problems creatively and
   collaboratively by developing a solution to given challenges using
   engineering and computer science knowledge, skills, and abilities. The
   purpose of this paper is to offer a framework for interdisciplinary
   hackathon challenge development, as well as provide resources to aid
   interdisciplinary teams in better understanding the context and needs of
   a hackathon to evaluate and refine hackathon challenges. Three cohorts
   of interdisciplinary STEAM researchers were observed and interviewed as
   they collaboratively created a hackathon challenge incorporating all
   cohort-member disciplines for an online high school hackathon. The
   observation data and interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic
   analysis to distill the processes cohorts underwent and resources that
   were necessary for successfully creating a hackathon challenge. Through
   this research we found that the cohorts worked through four sequential
   stages as they collaborated to create a hackathon challenge. We detail
   the stages and offer them as a framework for future teams who seek to
   develop an interdisciplinary hackathon challenge. Additionally, we found
   that all cohorts lacked the knowledge and experience with hackathons to
   make fully informed decisions related to the challenge's topic, scope,
   outcomes, etc. In response, this manuscript offers five hackathon
   quality considerations and three guiding principles for challenge
   developers to best meet the needs and goals of hackathon sponsors and
   participants.},

   Education},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Innovation is a crucial force underlying the organizational and societal
   ability to survive and thrive in crisis times, especially in education.
   However, not all challenges require creating novel solutions;
   occasionally, combining pre-existing solutions-an approach known as the
   mashup methodology-can provide equal benefit. Nevertheless, this
   approach appears to be relatively unknown. In the current case study, we
   provide an example of using a mashup of technologies to solve the
   challenge of running a remote virtual hackathon under COVID-19 social
   distancing regulations. Additionally, we argue that utilizing the mashup
   is a form of modeling, in which students learn by witnessing its use.
   Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model, we show that by modeling the
   use of the mashup methodology in this hackathon (Study 1-case), we
   managed to improve students' attitudes towards the method and increase
   its perceived usefulness and ease of use in their eyes. This, in turn,
   raised their intention to use it as an innovation tool in the future.
   Study 2 revealed that this effect on participants' intentions is more
   significant than what would be achieved by merely teaching people about
   the methodology. The results of these studies add to the growing
   literature emphasizing the importance of using digital innovations as
   means of improving the quality of education, thus increasing the
   satisfaction and well-being of students.},

Title = {Hackathons as extracurricular activities: Unraveling the motivational
   orientation behind student participation},

Abstract = {The education sector is constantly progressing its competency paradigm
   by establishing a nexus between practical, theoretical, and technical
   dimensions of teaching and learning. In the modern age of education,
   hackathons are becoming increasingly prominent in providing an optimal
   academic environment that connects classroom learnings to real-life
   scenarios. This study explored the motivational orientation behind
   student participation in hackathons through the framework provided by
   self-determination theory. Specifically, it investigated the role of
   intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in encouraging initial and
   continuous hackathon participation. The partial least squares-structural
   equation modeling method was used to analyze data collected from 437
   students in 12 countries. According to the findings, although intrinsic
   motivation influences participation intention, extrinsic motivation
   drives continuance participation. When intrinsic and extrinsic
   motivational constructs were analyzed individually, it was found that
   continuance participation demands both motivational orientations.
   Comparisons of demographic characteristics indicate that older students
   with more extensive educational experience may have higher intentions to
   participate and continue participating in these events. This study
   offers insights into how the education sector can increase hackathon
   participation by tapping on students' motivational orientation. From a
   methodological point of view, it is apparent to recommend the promotion
   of hackathons as a core extracurricular activity at a school level, and
   more indispensably, as pedagogy at a classroom level. In a world where
   students are encouraged to fail early, fast, and often, participating in
   hackathons is a tactical preparation for eventual success.},

Abstract = {Over last few decades, innovation became one of the most meaningful
   resources for successful management. In order to spark invention, the
   first step of innovation, a number of methods have been introduced
   including hackathon. This paper evaluates 14 hackathons over a period of
   over 3 years from various perspectives and with an ethnographic approach
   and different research methods- observation, 36 semi-structured
   interviews and netnography. Material analysis has been performed with
   methods of grounder theory, as well as machine learning as a
   triangulation method. As a result, types and approaches of hackathon,
   together with a new empirical definition, ways of how this method
   mitigates drawbacks of brain storming and a unique relationship between
   concepts of preparation difficulty and likelihood of desired invention
   at the hackathon have been introduced and presented.},

Abstract = {UNESCO World Heritage cities can become smart cities if they take into
   account their cultural heritage and integrate diverse actors, including
   universities in their innovation practices. This article addresses the
   hackathon as an innovation contest method in the urban and educational
   context. Specifically, it concentrates on hackathon design, particularly
   the focus of the event, as well as the outputs. Although the design
   plays an integral part in a hackathon, particularly in goal achievement,
   design has not yet been thoroughly studied in mainly descriptive
   hackathon research. To address the subject, this article presents a case
   study of a dual-focused, i.e., combined urban and educational hackathon
   in the City of Rauma, which has a World Heritage Old Town that aims to
   integrate its historical uniqueness with modern city services. As a
   result, the article portrays the process and outputs of a hackathon
   carried out with the collaboration of two higher education institutions
   (HEIs) and the Entrepreneur Association of Rauma. Presenting conclusions
   for both academics and the public sector, the article contributes to the
   literature on urban and educational hackathons in smart cities with a

Title = {One-off events? An empirical study of hackathon code creation and reuse},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {7},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate
   on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research
   focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the
   evolution of the hackathon code. Objective We aim to understand the
   evolution of code used in and created during hackathon events, with a
   particular focus on the code blobs, specifically, how frequently
   hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much new code they develop,
   if that code gets reused afterwards, and what factors affect reuse.
   Method We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from
   Devpost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project
   characteristics, original author, code creation time, language, and size
   information from World of Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by
   identifying all commits containing blobs created during hackathons and
   identifying all projects that contain those commits. We also conducted a
   series of surveys in order to gain a deeper understanding of hackathon
   code evolution that we sent out to hackathon participants whose code was
   reused, whose code was not reused, and developers who reused some
   hackathon code. Result 9.14\% of the code blobs in hackathon
   repositories and 8\% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during
   hackathons and around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other
   projects by both blob count and LOC. The number of associated
   technologies and the number of participants in hackathons increase reuse
   probability. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrates hackathons
   are not always ``one-off{''} events as the common knowledge dictates and
   it can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.},

   Choice of Courses and Hackathon-Based Teaching},
Journal = {HUMAN ARENAS},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the role of universities is experiencing a conflict:
   institutions need certificated and specialized professionals, and
   students need real knowledge. One hardly could imagine the
   implementation of this combination in the higher education system, even
   at the beginning of the university career. Bachelor's programs indeed
   tend to be overly specialized and dogmatic, careless of those creative
   processes underlying innovation. For these reasons, I suggest two
   innovations to rebalance the strife. The first consists of the
   possibility for each student to actively choose courses, thus creating
   personalized and heterogeneous study careers. The second innovation
   concerns the implementation of hackathon-based teaching to enrich
   learning through cooperation and competition to solve concrete problems.
   I suggest that these improvements would guarantee the formation of
   professionals and allow students to develop actively their system of
   knowledge, as well as they would break down the barriers to innovation
   in higher education.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a hackathon event that took place as part of the
   Ontology Summit in 2014. The purpose of this hackathon was to develop an
   integrated ontology for a potential travel risk application, and was
   intended as an exercise in ontology integration and re-use. The
   hackathon took place over a 48 hour period via remote teleconferencing.
   Several existing ontologies and ontology design patterns were integrated
   into one common framework, while a new ontology was developed from
   available data and integrated with these. The notion of ` event' as it
   relates to risk presented some interesting ontological issues that are
   described here. This paper describes the work that took place, gives a
   brief overview of the ontology content, and concludes with lessons
   learned on the opportunities and challenges in re-use of ontologies from
   different sources, including the implications of different ontological
   commitments. The final work product was substantial enough to form the
   basis of a possible travel risk application.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a rare disease in US,
   however, they account for 8-17\% of deaths in people with epilepsy. This
   disease involves complicated physiological patterns and it is still not
   clear what are the physio-/bio-makers that can be used as an indicator
   to predict SUDEP so that care providers can intervene and treat patients
   in a timely manner. For this sake, UTHealth School of Biomedical
   Informatics (SBMI) organized a machine learning Hackathon to call for
   advanced solutions
   https://sbmi.uth.edu/hackathon/archive/sept19.htm.MethodsIn recent
   years, deep learning has become state of the art for many domains with
   large amounts data. Although healthcare has accumulated a lot of data,
   they are often not abundant enough for subpopulation studies where deep
   learning could be beneficial. Taking these limitations into account, we
   present a framework to apply deep learning to the detection of the onset
   of slow activity after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, as well as
   other EEG signal detection problems exhibiting data paucity.ResultsWe
   conducted ten training runs for our full method and seven model
   variants, statistically demonstrating the impact of each technique used
   in our framework with a high degree of confidence.ConclusionsOur
   findings point toward deep learning being a viable method for detection
   of the onset of slow activity provided approperiate regularization is
   performed.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to describe the results of applying ethical AI
   requirements to a healthcare use case. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate the effectiveness of using open educational resources for
   Trustworthy AI to provide recommendations to an AI solution within the
   healthcare domain.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilizes the
   Hackathon method as its research methodology. Hackathons are short
   events where participants share a common goal. The purpose of this to
   determine the efficacy of the educational resources provided to the
   students. To achieve this objective, eight teams of students and faculty
   members participated in the Hackathon. The teams made suggestions for
   healthcare use case based on the knowledge acquired from educational
   resources. A research team based at the university hosting the Hackathon
   devised the use case. The healthcare research team participated in the
   Hackathon by presenting the use case and subsequently analysing and
   evaluating the utility of the outcomes.FindingsThe Hackathon produced a
   framework of proposed recommendations for the introduced healthcare use
   case, in accordance with the EU's requirements for Trustworthy
   AI.Research limitations/implicationsThe educational resources have been
   applied to one use-case.Originality/valueThis is the first time that
   open educational resources for Trustworthy AI have been utilized in
   higher education, making this a novel study. The university hosting the
   Hackathon has been the coordinator for the Trustworthy AI Hackathon (as
   partner to Trustworthy AI project).},

Abstract = {The hackathon was developed by practitioners and it could be said that
   they used structures and characteristics from other invention
   development methods that intend to spark creativity. This paper aims to
   define and evaluate those characteristics that serve as determinants of
   invention. It analyses research performed on 14 different hackathons
   with the following ethnographic approach: 1000 h of observation, 36
   semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography (netnography).
   Collected data has been analysed with the use of grounded theory methods
   and machine learning, which has been introduced as a triangulation
   method. As a result 9 main characteristics within the hackathon method
   that serve as invention determinants were discovered and holistically
   described. The identified elements have been backed by different
   theoretical backgrounds, but as one they form a flexible and unique
   mixture that helps to understand the hackathon phenomenon, potential
   hazards and its inner mechanisms. The discovered characteristics can
   help in effective organization of hackathons in the future.},

Abstract = {The National Science Foundation (NSF) 2018 Materials and Data Science
   Hackathon (MATDAT18) took place at the Residence Inn Alexandria Old
   Town/Duke Street, Alexandria, VA over the period May 30-June 1, 2018.
   This three-day collaborative ``hackathon{''} or ``datathon{''} brought
   together teams of materials scientists and data scientists to
   collaboratively engage materials science problems using data science
   tools. The materials scientists brought a diversity of problems ranging
   from inorganic material bandgap prediction to acceleration of ab initio
   molecular dynamics to quantification of aneurysm risk from blood
   hydrodynamics. The data scientists contributed tools and expertise in
   areas such as deep learning, Gaussian process regression, and sequential
   learning with which to engage these problems. Participants lived and
   worked together, collaboratively ``hacked{''} for several hours per day,
   delivered introductory, midpoint, and final presentations and were
   exposed to presentations and informal interactions with NSF personnel.
   Social events were organized to facilitate interactions between teams.
   The primary outcomes of the event were to seed new collaborations
   between materials and data scientists and generate preliminary results.
   A separate competitive process enabled participants to apply for
   exploratory funding to continue work commenced at the hackathon.
   Anonymously surveyed participants reported a high level of satisfaction
   with the event, with 100\% of respondents indicating that their team
   will continue to work together into the future and 91\% reporting intent
   to submit a white paper for exploratory funding.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to check the effectiveness of differentiated
   English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction using the hackathon.
   This study used the mixed research method. The participants of the study
   were 24 Information Technology (IT) students of the Physics and
   Technology Institute of National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor
   Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute{''} who voluntarily took part in the
   study in 2022-2023. They were divided into two experimental groups and
   differentiated according to the social roles and the level of English
   language proficiency. Sensory, interactive and graphic scaffolding as
   the temporary assistance was integrated in the educational process. As
   shown by the results of the experimental learning, the second group,
   where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of
   scaffolding use was defined by both students and teachers, demonstrated
   significantly better results than the first group, where the IT students
   performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was
   defined by IT students only. Scaffolding should be regulated by both the
   teacher and the students. It was concluded that the use of hackathon
   with a focus on learners' differentiation helps to diversify ESP
   learning at technical university and facilitates the development of
   professional communicative skills (speaking and writing) as well as
   other soft and hard skills.},

Title = {Application of MCAT questions as a testing tool and evaluation metric

Abstract = {``Knowledge graphs{''} (KGs) have become a common approach for
   representing biomedical knowledge. In a KG, multiple biomedical data
   sets can be linked together as a graph representation, with nodes
   representing entities, such as ``chemical substance{''} or ``genes,{''}
   and edges representing predicates, such as ``causes{''} or ``treats.{''}
   Reasoning and inference algorithms can then be applied to the KG and
   used to generate new knowledge. We developed three KG-based
   question-answering systems as part of the Biomedical Data Translator
   program. These systems are typically tested and evaluated using
   traditional software engineering tools and approaches. In this study, we
   explored a team-based approach to test and evaluate the prototype
   ``Translator Reasoners{''} through the application of Medical College
   Admission Test (MCAT) questions. Specifically, we describe three
   ``hackathons,{''} in which the developers of each of the three systems
   worked together with a moderator to determine whether the applications
   could be used to solve MCAT questions. The results demonstrate
   progressive improvement in system performance, with 0\% (0/5) correct
   answers during the first hackathon, 75\% (3/4) correct during the second
   hackathon, and 100\% (5/5) correct during the final hackathon. We
   discuss the technical and sociologic lessons learned and conclude that
   MCAT questions can be applied successfully in the context of moderated
   hackathons to test and evaluate prototype KG-based question-answering
   systems, identify gaps in current capabilities, and improve performance.
   Finally, we highlight several published clinical and translational
   science applications of the Translator Reasoners.},

   for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on February 2016 we
   organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live measurement and
   monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included students,
   researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding agencies,
   working together on projects to measure, visualize, and improve routing
   or the tools we use to study routing. This report describes the tools
   used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of the projects. The

Title = {Making Markets Material: Enactments, Resistances, and Erasures of
   Materiality in the Graduate Labour Market},
Journal = {WORK EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 7},
Abstract = {Scholarship on the graduate labour market, preoccupied by structure,
   agency, and power, has largely focused on the market's discursive
   composition. It has not yet paid significant attention to the concrete,
   material apparatus of the market and how this shapes market outcomes. In
   contrast, we approach the construction of the graduate labour market
   from a new materialist perspective and with reference to the growing
   literature of `market studies'. We consider the empirical case of a
   graduate recruitment hackathon to show how the hackathon's material
   features were implicated in enacting a specific occurrence of the
   graduate labour market. The agendas of the hackathon's designers and
   their visions of the graduate labour market were enacted in the
   hackathon's material arrangements, but this enactment was not always
   reliable: in some instances materiality resisted and erased corporate
   agendas. Our article contributes to the sociology of work by
   highlighting the dynamic relationship between materiality and power
   (re)production in the graduate labour market.},

Title = {``From Making to Learning{''}: introducing Dev Camps as an educational
   paradigm for Re-inventing Problem-based Learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Dev Camps are events that enable participants to tackle challenges using
   software tools and different kinds of hardware devices in collaborative
   project-style activities. The participants conceptualize and develop
   their solutions in a self-directed way, involving technical,
   organizational and social skills. In this sense, they are autonomous
   producers or ``makers{''}. The Dev Camp activity format resonates with
   skills such as communication, critical thinking, creativity,
   decision-making and planning and can be considered as a bridge between
   education and industry. In this paper we present and analyse our
   experience from a series of such events that were co-organized between
   an industrial partner acting as a host and several university partners.
   We take this as an indication to envision new opportunities for
   projectbased learning in more formal educational scenarios.},

   Music Hackathon NYC hosts non-competitive community-based events in
   which participants - musicians, educators, coders, and software/hardware
   designers from beginner to expert - work on projects collaboratively
   over the course of a day to address real-world problems posed by
   stakeholders in their communities. Our research team consisting of the
   principal investigator and two research assistants attended and
   videorecorded the events of Monthly Music Hackathon NYC's `Music
   AccessAbility' hackathon. In this article, we detail what constitutes
   hacking at this event and how participants approached hacking
   disability. We discuss the potential of hacking in music education to
   create a more accessible and inclusive field, and the importance of
   championing a disability-led design model as the ethical way forward.},

Abstract = {Applying machine learning to healthcare sheds light on evidence-based
   decision making and has shown promises to improve healthcare by
   combining clinical knowledge and biomedical data. However, medicine and
   data science are not synchronized. Oftentimes, researchers with a strong
   data science background do not understand the clinical challenges, while
   on the other hand, physicians do not know the capacity and limitation of
   state-of-the-art machine learning methods. The difficulty boils down to
   the lack of a common interface between two highly intelligent
   communities due to the privacy concerns and the disciplinary gap. The
   School of Biomedical Informatics (SBMI) at UTHealth is a pilot in
   connecting both worlds to promote interdisciplinary research. Recently,
   the Center for Secure Artificial Intelligence For hEalthcare (SAFE) at
   SBMI is organizing a series of machine learning healthcare hackathons
   for real-world clinical challenges. We hosted our first Hackathon themed
   centered around Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy and finding ways to
   recognize the warning signs. This community effort demonstrated that
   interdisciplinary discussion and productive competition has
   significantly increased the accuracy of warning sign detection compared
   to the previous work, and ultimately showing a potential of this
   hackathon as a platform to connect the two communities of data science
   and medicine.},

   hackers, mentors, judges and organisers before, during and after the
   event. Findings indicate diversity amongst participants in terms of age,
   gender and experiences. The hackers' motivations were both intrinsic and
   extrinsic. The challenges were insufficient time, absence of investors,
   inconsistent mentoring, low participation from public schools and
   imbalanced gender participation. The hackathon provided a unique
   opportunity for multidisciplinary collaborative problem-solving and
   accessing experts for creativity and innovation. Future research should
   focus on increasing participation and fostering social innovations

Title = {Interdisciplinary Online Hackathons as an Approach to Combat the
   COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of
   people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the
   global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together
   communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented
   manner.
   Objective: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in
   the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on
   challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear
   implementation road map for other organizations to follow.
   Methods: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six
   COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and
   researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to
   assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of
   interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects
   realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event,
   participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5
   optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that
   assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and
   their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their
   confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the
   hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also
   provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey.
   Results: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different
   countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75
   mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased
   confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project
   after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they
   were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants
   who provided feedback, 60\% (n=18) would not have started their project
   without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon
   encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building
   interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by
   their mentors, and creating a functional prototype.
   Conclusions: This study provides insights into how online hackathons can
   contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in
   several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity,
   increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster
   and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation,
   organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for
   other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar
   event formats in the fight against COVID-19.},

Title = {Curricular Hackathons for Engineering Design Learning: The Case of
   Engineering Design Days},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Contribution: This article defines ``curricular hackathons{''} and
   describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the
   hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience
   implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students
   with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and
   integrative design problems.Background: Design is an essential part of
   engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are
   provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving
   ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year
   capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities
   are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry
   significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon
   format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for
   formative design practice.Research Question: How can the hackathon
   format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology:
   The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight
   from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the
   University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two
   methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an
   interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and
   implementation.Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a
   curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact
   on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social
   experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a
   design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some
   level of integration and/or embedding in a program's curriculum.},

Abstract = {Hackathons are time-bounded crowdsourcing events, which have recently
   prospered in many technology and science domains across the globe. We
   study Europe's largest hackathon, Junction, to better understand the
   distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of this type of
   hackathon as a form of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Moreover, we
   determined how they add value to attending companies and participants.
   In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from
   participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed.
   Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and
   mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection,
   strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential,
   and pervasive information technology. Based on our findings, we argue
   that these properties and mechanisms increase the possibility of finding
   innovative solutions to companies' problems in Junction-like mega
   hackathons. This article concludes with managerial implications for
   companies to consciously plan and prepare while knowing what to expect
   during the hackathon.},

Title = {A Men Who Have Sex With Men-Friendly Doctor Finder Hackathon in
   Guangzhou, China: Development of a Mobile Health Intervention to Enhance
   Health Care Utilization},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHeath)-based HIV and sexual health promotion
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) is feasible in low- and
   middle-income settings. However, many currently available mHealth tools
   on the market were developed by the private sector for profit and have
   limited input from MSM communities.
   Objective: A health hackathon is an intensive contest that brings
   together participants from multidisciplinary backgrounds to develop a
   proposed solution for a specific health issue within a short period. The
   purpose of this paper was to describe a hackathon event that aimed to
   develop an mHealth tool to enhance health care (specifically HIV
   prevention) utilization among Chinese MSM, summarize characteristics of
   the final prototypes, and discuss implications for future mHealth
   intervention development.
   Methods: The hackathon took place in Guangzhou, China. An open call for
   hackathon participants was advertised on 3 Chinese social media
   platforms, including Blued, a popular social networking app among MSM.
   All applicants completed a Web-based survey and were then scored. The
   top scoring applicants were grouped into teams based on their skills and
   content area expertise. Each team was allowed 1 month to prepare for the
   hackathon. The teams then came together in person with on-site expert
   mentorship for a 72-hour hackathon contest to develop and present
   mHealth prototype solutions. The judging panel included experts in
   psychology, public health, computer science, social media, clinical
   medicine, and MSM advocacy. The final prototypes were evaluated based on
   innovation, usability, and feasibility.
   Results: We received 92 applicants, and 38 of them were selected to
   attend the April 2019 hackathon. A total of 8 teams were formed,
   including expertise in computer science, user interface design, business
   or marketing, clinical medicine, and public health. Moreover, 24
   participants self-identified as gay, and 3 participants self-identified
   as bisexual. All teams successfully developed a prototype tool. A total
   of 4 prototypes were designed as a mini program that could be embedded
   within a popular Chinese social networking app, and 3 prototypes were
   designed as stand-alone apps. Common prototype functions included
   Web-based physician searching based on one's location (8 prototypes),
   health education (4 prototypes), Web-based health counseling with
   providers or lay health volunteers (6 prototypes), appointment
   scheduling (8 prototypes), and between-user communication (2
   prototypes). All prototypes included strategies to ensure privacy
   protection for MSM users, and some prototypes offered strategies to
   ensure privacy of physicians. The selected prototypes are undergoing
   pilot testing.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability
   of using a hackathon to create mHealth intervention tools. This suggests
   a different pathway to developing mHealth interventions and could be
   relevant in other settings.},

Title = {Institutionalizing healthcare hackathons to promote diversity in
   collaboration in medicine},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {BackgroundMedical students and healthcare professionals can benefit from
   exposure to cross-disciplinary teamwork and core concepts of medical
   innovation. Indeed, to address complex challenges in patient care,
   diversity in collaboration across medicine, engineering, business, and
   design is critical. However, a limited number of academic institutions
   have established cross-disciplinary opportunities for students and young
   professionals within these domains to work collaboratively towards
   diverse healthcare needs.MethodsDrawing upon best practices from
   computer science and engineering, healthcare hackathons bring together
   interdisciplinary teams of students and professionals to collaborate,
   brainstorm, and build solutions to unmet clinical needs. Over the course
   of six months, a committee of 20 undergraduates, medical students, and
   physician advisors organized Stanford University's first healthcare
   hackathon (November 2016). Demographic data from initial applications
   were supplemented with responses from a post-hackathon survey gauging
   themes of diversity in collaboration, professional development, interest
   in medical innovation, and educational value. In designing and
   evaluating the event, the committee focused on measurable outcomes of
   diversity across participants (skillset, age, gender, academic degree),
   ideas (clinical needs), and innovations (projects).ResultsDemographic
   data (n=587 applicants, n=257 participants) reveal participants across
   diverse academic backgrounds, age groups, and domains of expertise were
   in attendance. From 50 clinical needs presented representing 19 academic
   fields, 40 teams ultimately formed and submitted projects spanning web
   (n=13) and mobile applications (n=13), artificial intelligence-based
   tools (n=6), and medical devices (n=3), among others. In post-hackathon
   survey responses (n=111), medical students and healthcare professionals
   alike noted a positive impact on their ability to work in
   multidisciplinary teams, learn from individuals of different
   backgrounds, and address complex healthcare
   challenges.ConclusionsHealthcare hackathons can encourage diversity
   across individuals, ideas, and projects to address clinical challenges.
   By providing an outline of Stanford's inaugural event, we hope more
   universities can adopt the healthcare hackathon model to promote
   diversity in collaboration in medicine.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning
   model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a ``hackathon,{''}
   to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a
   particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity
   students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to
   foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to
   introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a
   narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students
   participated in the workshop and completed pre-and post-surveys, and a
   free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in
   computing. Analysis revealed that students' motivation to learn about
   the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable
   technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following
   participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and
   outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in
   the computing word associations, with students associating computing
   more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as
   the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon
   event and a model for 21st-century learning can be effective in
   motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers
   in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and
   wearables.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Hackathons are intense, short, collaborative events focusing on solving
   real world problems through interdisciplinary teams. This is a report of
   the mHealth hackathon hosted by Khon Kaen University in collaboration
   with MIT Sana and faculty members from Harvard Medical School with the
   aim to improve health care delivery in the Northeast region of Thailand.
   Key health challenges, such as improving population health literacy,
   tracking disease trajectory and outcomes among rural communities, and
   supporting the workflow of overburdened frontline providers, were
   addressed using mHealth. Many modifications from the usual format of
   hackathon were made to tailor the event to the local context and
   culture, such as the process of recruiting participants and how teams
   were matched and formed. These modifications serve as good learning
   points for hosting future hackathons. There are also many lessons
   learned about how to achieve a fruitful collaboration despite cultural
   barriers, how to best provide mentorship to the participants, how to
   instill in the participants a sense of mission, and how to match the
   participants in a fair and efficient manner. This event showcases how
   interdisciplinary collaboration can produce results that are
   unattainable by any discipline alone and demonstrates that innovations
   are the fruits of collective wisdom of people from different fields of
   expertise who work together toward the same goals.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study was intended to demonstrate the applicability of
   the hackathon in idea generation for managing emergencies and disasters
   with a particular focus on flash floods. Methods: A 4-day hackathon
   event was held, having 60 students, 9 mentors and 6 judges gathered to
   explore different ideas, and to solve problems of Iran flooding from
   mid-March to April, 2019. Of these, 10 teams with 6 students were
   accordingly formed to brainstorm and discuss the idea, while 9 mentors
   offered advice and guided them to manage their ideas. Then, all teams
   focused on designing their business models. Finally, the hackathon teams
   finalized their lean canvas and presented their ideas to the judging
   panel and the other participants. Results: A total of 10 ideas were
   presented, and based on the knowledge and experience of the judges, 3
   ideas that were more practical and useful were selected. Conclusions: As
   participants in a hackathon identify and present real-world problems,
   while ensuring that the prototype solutions address the end-user's
   needs, it could be used to drive innovation, generate ideas, promote
   change in emergencies and disasters, and can increase our preparedness
   for future events. It helps us to develop tools and applications to
   better respond to these events.},

Title = {NCBI's Virus Discovery Hackathon: Engaging Research Communities to

Journal = {GENES},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A wealth of viral data sits untapped in publicly available metagenomic
   data sets when it might be extracted to create a usable index for the
   virological research community. We hypothesized that work of this
   complexity and scale could be done in a hackathon setting. Ten teams
   comprised of over 40 participants from six countries, assembled to
   create a crowd-sourced set of analysis and processing pipelines for a
   complex biological data set in a three-day event on the San Diego State
   University campus starting 9 January 2019. Prior to the hackathon,
   141,676 metagenomic data sets from the National Center for Biotechnology
   Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) were pre-assembled into
   contiguous assemblies (contigs) by NCBI staff. During the hackathon, a
   subset consisting of 2953 SRA data sets (approximately 55 million
   contigs) was selected, which were further filtered for a minimal length
   of 1 kb. This resulted in 4.2 million (Mio) contigs, which were aligned
   using BLAST against all known virus genomes, phylogenetically clustered
   and assigned metadata. Out of the 4.2 Mio contigs, 360,000 contigs were
   labeled with domains and an additional subset containing 4400 contigs
   was screened for virus or virus-like genes. The work yielded valuable
   insights into both SRA data and the cloud infrastructure required to
   support such efforts, revealing analysis bottlenecks and possible
   workarounds thereof. Mainly: (i) Conservative assemblies of SRA data
   improves initial analysis steps; (ii) existing bioinformatic software
   with weak multithreading/multicore support can be elevated by wrapper
   scripts to use all cores within a computing node; (iii) redesigning
   existing bioinformatic algorithms for a cloud infrastructure to
   facilitate its use for a wider audience; and (iv) a cloud infrastructure
   allows a diverse group of researchers to collaborate effectively. The
   scientific findings will be extended during a follow-up event. Here, we
   present the applied workflows, initial results, and lessons learned from
   the hackathon.},

Abstract = {Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments may at
   times become socio-emotionally tense and pose challenges that may have
   detrimental effects on mutual trust and shared mental models. Objective.
   This study aims to examine and classify general teamwork challenges in a
   novel but authentic CSCL setting (hackathon) to identify challenges that
   impede the development of key team coordination mechanisms (i.e., mutual
   trust and shared mental models). Methods. Multimodal data including
   responses to an adapted questionnaire (AIRE), post-competition interview
   data, and videos of team interaction were collected during an
   international hackathon event (N=48, 71\% male, M=22 years age).
   Qualitative theory-driven coding and theme development were used to
   analyze the multimodal dataset (Greeno, 2006; Jarvenoja et al., 2013).
   Results. Our analyses revealed 16 general challenges that hamper
   teamwork in a hackathon. A model of team challenges was developed to
   categorize challenges into macro level themes including cognitive,
   motivational, emotional and behavioral challenges. We also identified
   which challenges hindered the development of mutual trust, and which
   challenges hindered the development of shared mental models.
   Conclusions. These findings provide important insights for educators and
   mentors in understanding the types of teamwork challenges that may occur
   in CSCL settings. The results also inform educators which challenges
   likely lead to mutual trust breakdown and weaken shared mental model
   bonds.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HUMANITARIAN LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 21},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to document students' supply chain solutions
   developed through the internship hackathon program. The study profiled
   innovative solutions developed by university students in Kenya to solve
   health supply chain logistics challenges during and beyond COVID-19.
   This is done by exploring students' experience in developing sustainable
   logistics and supply chain management capacity-building programs in a
   low-middle-income country (LMIC). Design/methodology/approachThis study
   used a qualitative approach to explore the experiences and perceptions
   of students and mentors who participated in a hackathon program. The
   study followed a cross-sectional descriptive survey design, collecting
   data from the participants through online questionnaires. The data were
   analyzed and presented using thematic analysis and narrative techniques.
   FindingsFindings provide preliminary evidence for narrowing the gap
   between theory and practice through a hackathon internship blended with
   a mentorship program. Assessment of this program provides evidence for
   developing solutions toward ensuring the availability of essential
   medicine in LMICs during a pandemic such as COVID-19 by students. The
   profiled solutions demonstrate a broader perspective of innovative
   solutions of university students, mentors and potential opportunities
   for a triple helix approach to innovation for health supply chain system
   strengthening. Research limitations/implicationsThis original study
   provides evidence for advancing contribution to developing innovative
   solutions through partnerships between investors, universities and
   industry practitioners interested in mentoring students in the
   health-care supply chain during COVID-19 in LMICs. Specifically,
   contingency factors that affect the implementation of innovative
   programs during and beyond global pandemics such as COVID-19 by
   students' innovators are identified, and implications for policy action
   are discussed based on the praxis of sensemaking. Practical
   implicationsThis study examines a novel approach that combines
   internship, mentorship and hackathon projects for logistics and supply
   chain students in LMICs. The approach aims to bridge the gap between
   theory and practice and to create innovative solutions for essential
   medicines during and after COVID-19. The study urges more resources for
   supporting such programs, as they benefit both academia and industry.
   The study also argues that hackathon internship programs can help the
   logistics and supply chain industry adapt to the post-pandemic era. The
   study offers insights for investors, universities and practitioners in
   the health-care industry. Originality/valueThis study shows how to
   develop innovative solutions for the health-care supply chain during
   COVID-19 in an LMIC through partnerships between investors, universities
   and industry practitioners who mentor students. The study identifies the
   contingency factors that influence the success of such programs during
   and beyond global pandemics such as COVID-19 and discusses the policy
   implications based on the sensemaking praxis of the student innovators.},

Title = {The 2006 NESCent Phyloinformatics Hackathon: A Field Report},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {287-296},
Abstract = {In December, 2006, a group of 26 software developers from some of the
   most widely used life science programming toolkits and phylogenetic
   software projects converged on Durham, North Carolina, for a
   Phyloinformatics Hackathon, an intense five-day collaborative software
   coding event sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
   (NESCent). The goal was to help researchers to integrate multiple
   phylogenetic software tools into automated workflows. Participants
   addressed deficiencies in interoperability between programs by
   implementing ``glue code{''} and improving support for phylogenetic data
   exchange standards (particularly NEXUS) across the toolkits. The work
   was guided by use-cases compiled in advance by both developers and
   users, and the code was documented as it was developed. The resulting
   software is freely available for both users and developers through
   incorporation into the distributions of several widely-used open-source
   toolkits. We explain the motivation for the hackathon, how it was
   organized, and discuss some of the outcomes and lessons learned. We
   conclude that hackathons are an effective mode of solving problems in
   software interoperability and usability, and are underutilized in
   scientific software development.},

Abstract = {Hackathons are events that are a sort of application development
   marathons - lasting between 24 and 48 hours - that became increasingly
   popular as a method for fast learning and bring people in a short space
   of time to make creative projects. However, the number of women
   participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when
   considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers,
   designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to
   understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We
   sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them
   avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a
   female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of
   Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.},

Abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests,
   hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention
   from practitioners and researchers. Yet there is a paucity of research
   on corporate hackathons, which are nearly ubiquitous and present
   significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges. To
   provide a comprehensive understanding of team processes and broad array
   of outcomes of corporate hackathons, we conducted a mixed-methods,
   multiple case study of five teams that participated in a large scale
   corporate hackathon. Two teams were ``pre-existing{''} teams (PETs) and
   three were newly-formed ``flash{''} teams (FTs). Our analysis revealed
   that PETs coordinated almost as if it was just another day at the office
   while creating innovations within the boundary of their regular work,
   whereas FTs adopted role-based coordination adapted to the hackathon
   context while creating innovations beyond the boundary of their regular
   work. Project sustainability depended on how much effort the team put
   into finding a home for their projects and whether their project was a
   good fit with existing products in the organization's product portfolio.
   Moreover, hackathon participation had perceived positive effects on
   participants' skills, careers, and social networks.},

   approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young
   programmers and older adults participants. Below we describe a case
   study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older
   adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our
   results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good
   practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar

Title = {A Systems Engineering Hackathon - A Methodology Involving Multiple
   Stakeholders to Progress Conceptual Design of a Complex Engineered
   Product},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {38399-38410},
Abstract = {This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process
   and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and
   development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in
   this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a
   diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision
   criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and
   communication of information across traditional engineering and
   operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is
   highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where
   stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members
   were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a
   hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured
   around the technical functions within an engineering company has the
   capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale
   for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon
   method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better
   manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall
   design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it
   can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80\%
   reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with
   using current/regular internal methods.},

Abstract = {The ORCA bioinformatics environment is a Docker image that contains
   hundreds of bioinformatics tools and their dependencies. The ORCA image
   and accompanying server infrastructure provide a comprehensive
   bioinformatics environment for education and research. The ORCA
   environment on a server is implemented using Docker containers, but
   without requiring users to interact directly with Docker, suitable for
   novices who may not yet have familiarity with managing containers. ORCA
   has been used successfully to provide a private bioinformatics
   environment to external collaborators at a large genome institute, for
   teaching an undergraduate class on bioinformatics targeted at
   biologists, and to provide a ready-to-go bioinformatics suite for a
   hackathon. Using ORCA eliminates time that would be spent debugging
   software installation issues, so that time may be better spent on
   education and research.},

Title = {Identification and prediction of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis

Abstract = {Background The new concept of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis
   (D2T RA) refers to RA patients who remain symptomatic after several
   lines of treatment, resulting in a high patient and economic burden.
   During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in
   structured and unstructured routine care data. Methods Routine care data
   of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented
   Database. Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA
   patients were clinically classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as
   a validation set. Machine learning techniques, text mining, and feature
   importance analyses were performed to identify and predict D2T RA
   patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data. Results
   We identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA
   definition in structured and unstructured routine care data.
   Additionally, we developed a D2T RA identification model derived from a
   feature importance analysis of all available structured data (AUC-ROC
   0.88 (95\% CI 0.82-0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential of
   longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA
   patients using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to
   the time of starting the first biological treatment, we predicted future
   development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71-0.75)). Conclusions
   During this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different
   techniques for the identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in
   structured as well as unstructured routine care data. The results are
   promising and should be optimized and validated in future research.},

Title = {Examining the Relationship Between Socially-Shared Emotion Regulation
   and Building Team Coordination Mechanisms During a Hackathon},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 31},
Abstract = {For effective teamwork, especially in demanding learning situations like
   a hackathon, coordination is crucial as it contributes to mutual trust
   and shared mental models of team members. However, teams experience
   challenges that mar team coordination. Research has shown that
   interpersonal skills such as socially-shared emotion regulation (SSER)
   can be key in dealing with such challenges. We examined the relationship
   between SSER and mutual trust, and SSER and shared mental models in the
   context of a hackathon. Adapted from a small SSER scale, we built a
   27-item questionnaire to examine SSER and its relationship with mutual
   trust and shared mental modelsin programming teams. We also used heat
   maps to provide an overview of individual team members' perceptions of
   their teams' SSER strategy application, mutual trust, and strength of
   shared mental model bonds within the team. Regarding the relationship
   between SSER and shared mental models, our analyses revealed
   signification association (correlation) between: (a) SSER situation
   modification and shared mental model: task and communication skills and
   (b) SSER situation modification and shared mental model: team dynamics
   and interaction. For the relationship between SSER and mutual trust, our
   analyses revealed significant relationships between: (a) SSER situation
   modification and perceived trustworthiness, (b) SSER cognitive change
   and perceived trustworthiness, (c) SSER response modulation and
   cooperative behaviors, and (d) SSER response modulation and monitoring
   behaviors. These relationships highlight the power of SSER in building
   key team coordination mechanisms and strengthening team performance.},

Abstract = {Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and
   analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using
   data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new
   programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes
   of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software
   development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from
   traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses
   are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with
   rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a
   hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking
   and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science
   methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack
   weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the
   exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help
   them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based
   on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective,
   easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data
   analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and
   cultivate best practices.},

   community-based interventions, and (iii) how to design tools for
   behaviour change that are easy to use. These reviews served as the
   foundation for developing a toolkit to support the co-design of
   community-based active ageing, which was evaluated during an
   interdisciplinary hackathon with older adults. Quantitative data from
   the surveys suggested that the confidence levels of students in
   developing interventions for health behaviour change and in co-designing
   with older adults increased after the hackathon, and the enjoyment of
   participating in the hackathon and of using the toolkit were
   statistically significant factors influencing this increase. Qualitative
   data from interviews and observations revealed how the toolkit was
   (un)used by the participants and what aspects of the toolkit can be
   improved. We encourage future researchers and practitioners to apply and
   adapt our research findings to the communities of older adults that they
   are working with.},

Abstract = {Emerging multiplexed imaging platforms provide an unprecedented view of
   an increasing number of molecular markers at subcellular resolution and
   the dynamic evolution of tumor cellular composition. As such, they are
   capable of elucidating cell-to-cell interactions within the tumor
   microenvironment that impact clinical outcome and therapeutic response.
   However, the rapid development of these platforms has far outpaced the
   computational methods for processing and analyzing the data they
   generate. While being technologically disparate, all imaging assays
   share many computational requirements for post-collection data
   processing. As such, our Image Analysis Working Group (IAWG), composed
   of researchers in the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium (CSBC) and the
   Physical Sciences Oncology Network (PS-ON), convened a workshop on
   ``Computational Challenges Shared by Diverse Imaging Platforms{''} to
   characterize these common issues and a follow-up hackathon to implement
   solutions for a selected subset of them. Here, we delineate these areas
   that reflect major axes of research within the field, including image
   registration, segmentation of cells and subcellular structures, and
   identification of cell types from their morphology. We further describe
   the logistical organization of these events, believing our lessons
   learned can aid others in uniting the imaging community around
   self-identified topics of mutual interest, in designing and implementing
   operational procedures to address those topics and in mitigating issues
   inherent in image analysis (e.g., sharing exemplar images of large
   datasets and disseminating baseline solutions to hackathon challenges
   through open-source code repositories).},

Abstract = {This article assesses the experience with i-Log at the European Big Data
   Hackathon 2019, a satellite event of the New Techniques and Technologies
   for Statistics (NTTS) conference, organised by Eurostat. i-Log is a
   system that enables capturing personal big data from smartphones'
   internal sensors to be used for time use measurement. It allows the
   collection of heterogeneous types of data, enabling new possibilities
   for sociological urban field studies. Sensor data such as those related
   to the location or the movements of the user can be used to investigate
   and gain insights into the time diaries' answers and assess their
   overall quality. The key idea is that the users' answers are used to
   train machine-learning algorithms, allowing the system to learn from the
   user's habits and to generate new time diaries' answers. In turn, these
   new labels can be used to assess the quality of existing ones, or to
   fill the gaps when the user does not provide an answer. The aim of this
   paper is to introduce the pilot study, the i-Log system and the
   methodological evidence that emerged during the survey.},

Title = {Global Surgery Hackathons: A Case Study From Pakistan},
Journal = {SURGICAL INNOVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {496-501},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background. Hackathons aim to solve problems in a selected field by
   bringing together people from multiple domains and combining their
   expertise. Global surgery is an emerging field with a huge burden of
   disease and massive implications for bettering health care. In this
   study, we describe the first Global Surgery Hackathon held in Pakistan
   and analyze the impacts of the hack and post-hack incubation. Methods.
   This research study used data collected from a Hackathon held at the Aga
   Khan University (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and progress from the
   post-hack incubation teams. Data were collected from applications, from
   sign-in attendance, via evaluation forms, and milestone tracking of the
   incubation teams. A list of factors such as sectors addressed by winning
   projects and grants received was made. Results. The evaluations provided
   by the participants were positive, with mean scores of 4.00 (SD = .78)
   out of 5 on a Likert scale. Pitches made (n = 69, 68\%) by the 109
   participants were sorted into 5 categories: workplace, access, quality,
   safety, and design. Fifteen teams were formed, out of which 5 were
   accepted for incubation. All teams had a minimum viable product at the
   one-year mark. Conclusion. Hackathons are a reliable way to come up with
   effective solutions for targeted problems in various areas of health
   care and using the methodology of a Hackathon, a pool of low-cost,
   innovative solutions can be generated. These solutions can definitely
   impact health outcomes, especially for the field of global surgery.
   Further statistics should be collected to affirm the incubated
   solutions' impact.},

Abstract = {Educational hackathons are a new way to respond to some of the biggest
   challenges in education. This exploratory study seeks to define the key
   elements of these hackathons and to offer a theoretical and practical
   starting point for future publications and research. A literature review
   is carried out, with the information then contrasted with the experience
   as organizers of EDhack Raval, the first community-focussed educational
   hackathon in Catalonia. Observations, a questionnaire and interviews are
   used to add depth and objectivity to the wealth of data derived from
   field work. The results point to the valorization of the freedom of the
   creative process, the generation of community networks and social
   learning over the creation of solutions, findings that coincide with the
   latest research.
   Thus, the study concludes that educational agents would do well to
   appropriate, adapt and evaluate the assets of the hacker culture, making
   sure not to commit the error or organising hackathons that promote
   solutionism, elitism and competition.},

Abstract = {This article explores innovation initiatives in rural communities in
   Iceland conveyed through the implementation and perceived outcomes of
   the hackathon Hacking Hekla. Digitalisation is often proposed as a new,
   all-purpose tool for regional development that responds to rural
   challenges innovatively. However, the digital role is often less clear
   when examining finer development practices. Hackathons are frequently
   applied to achieve instant economic and societal change. Through the
   example of Hacking Hekla, we research the challenges and outcomes of
   creative interventions and critically explore the value of innovation
   and digitalisation in the context of rural development in Iceland. Based
   on action research, we use the hackathon as a tool for knowledge
   generation and intervention in regional policy discourse with the
   intention to foster applied digital innovation. Data were collected
   using qualitative semi-structured interviews. The study demonstrates a
   gap between regional policies emphasising digital innovation and
   innovation practices on the ground and argues that fostering digital
   innovation in rural communities is a complex process that could
   demonstrate effects only in the long term.},

   projects address systemic changes? The Education DesignShop introduced
   new ways to collaborate and form sustainable solutions. Eight key
   structural components are identified around just-in-time modules
   teaching design thinking in an educational context. Projects from the

Journal = {SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 21},
Abstract = {Conversations about the internationalization of psychological sciences
   have occurred over a few decades with very little progress. Previous
   work shows up to 95\% of participants in the studies published in
   mainstream journals are from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich,
   Democratic nations. Similarly, a large proportion of authors are based
   in North America. This imbalance is well-documented across a range of
   subfields in psychology, yet the specific steps and best practices to
   bridge publication and data gaps across world regions are still unclear.
   To address this issue, we conducted a hackathon at the Society for the
   Improvement of Psychological Science 2021 conference to develop
   guidelines to improve international representation of authors and
   participants, adapted for various stakeholders in the production of
   psychological knowledge. Based on this hackathon, we discuss specific
   guidelines and practices that funding bodies, academic institutions,
   professional academic societies, journal editors and reviewers, and
   researchers should engage with to ensure psychology is the scientific
   discipline of human behavior and cognition across the world. These
   recommendations will help us develop a more valid and fairer science of
   human sociality.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Starting as niche programming events, hackathons have since become a
   popular form of collaboration. Events are organized in various domains
   across the globe, aiming to foster innovation and learning, create and
   expand communities and tackle civic and environmental issues. While
   research around such events has grown in recent years, most studies are
   based on observations of a few individuals during an event and on
   post-hoc interviews during which participants report their experiences.
   Such studies are helpful but somewhat limited in that they do not allow
   us to study how individuals communicate at scale using technology. To
   address this gap, we conducted an archival analysis of communication
   traces of teams during a 48-h event. Our findings indicate that teams
   scaffold their communication around the design of an event, influenced
   by milestones set by the organizers. The officially selected
   communication platform's main use was to organize the event and the
   teams and to facilitate contact between participants and hackathon
   officials. We further investigated the balance of intra-team
   communication on the given platform and the potential use of additional
   communication tools.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE ARTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {25-38},
Abstract = {Machine learning offers great potential to developers and end users in
   the creative industries. For example, it can support new sensor-based
   interactions, procedural content generation and end-user product
   customisation. However, designing machine learning toolkits for adoption
   by creative developers is still a nascent effort. This work focuses on
   the application of user-centred design with creative end-user developers
   for informing the design of an interactive machine learning toolkit. We
   introduce a framework for user-centred design actions that we developed
   within the context of an European Union innovation project, RAPID-MIX.
   We illustrate the application of the framework with two actions for
   lightweight formative evaluation of our toolkit-the JUCE Machine
   Learning Hackathon and the RAPID-MIX API workshop at eNTERFACE'17. We
   describe how we used these actions to uncover conceptual and technical
   limitations. We also discuss how these actions provided us with a better
   understanding of users, helped us to refine the scope of the design
   space, and informed improvements to the toolkit. We conclude with a
   reflection about the knowledge we obtained from applying user-centred
   design to creative technology, in the context of an innovation project
   in the creative industries.},

Abstract = {Education for sustainability (EfS) in the hospitality sector is
   increasingly recognised as one of the driving forces for sustainable
   development. One way of fostering sustainability in the hospitality
   industry is through sustainability hackathons, which are intensive
   events focusing on ``hacking{''} new sustainability ideas. This paper
   critically explores how the hospitality industry designs and executes
   sustainability hackathons within the context of EfS. An exploratory case
   study was conducted on the Scandic Hotels chain. Data utilised including
   both relevant reports and in-depth interviews with the highest level of
   management of Scandic. The execution of the sustainability hackathon
   illuminates how value-based education, creative problem-solving and
   co-opetition were critical aspects to foster EfS in the hospitality
   industry. Moreover, the hackathon facilitators, i.e. the hotels' General
   Managers, were found to play an essential part in shaping the
   sustainability education and the event's potential impacts. This paper
   contributes to expand knowledge on EfS offered by the hospitality
   industry (as opposed to EfS in formal educational institutions) and make
   practical recommendations on how sustainability hackathons could be
   better facilitated by hotel chains.},

Abstract = {This paper shows the effects of training entrepreneurial competences on
   employability in higher education. It identifies teaching methods that
   are more effective in order to improve entrepreneurial competences.
   These are hackathon, team building, role play, and practical cases with
   entrepreneurs at a Spanish university. In contrast to the methods shown
   in previous literature, a mixed-method is proposed. Firstly, a
   qualitative technique based on three focus groups with the participation
   of lecturers, students, and entrepreneurs are used. Additionally, a
   regression analysis seeks links between entrepreneurial intention and
   employability with entrepreneurial competences with 329 students. The
   findings show the direct effect on skills appreciated in companies,
   using collaborative and practical activities focusing on competency
   perspective. This research work provides a new approach to training
   entrepreneurial competences that demonstrates the main role of Open
   Innovation enhancing the main stakeholders' motivation and improving
   their skills. Useful information is provided to design the academic
   syllabuses and improve the level of employability of university
   graduates.},

Title = {Hackathons as Stepping Stones in Health Care Innovation: Case Study With
   Systematic Recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Until recently, developing health technologies was
   time-consuming and expensive, and often involved patients, doctors, and
   other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end
   product. So far, users have been minimally involved in the ideation and
   creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address
   users' unmet needs, a transdisciplinary and user-led approach, involving
   cocreation and direct user feedback, is required. In this context,
   hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating
   enthusiasm for user-centered innovation.
   Objective: This case study describes preparatory steps and the
   performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health
   care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were
   assessed, leading to the development of systematic recommendations for
   future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care.
   Methods: A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin,
   Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field
   notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the
   research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in
   December 2017 and November 2018 were included.
   Results: In total, 30 participants took part, with 63\% (19/30) of
   participants between 25 and 34 years of age, 30\% (9/30) between 35 and
   44 years of age, and 7\% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of
   43\% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of
   medical experts, including patients and health care professionals, was
   30\% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a
   specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a
   chatbot for skin cancer recognition, an augmented reality exposure-based
   therapy (eg, for arachnophobia), an app for medical neighborhood
   connectivity, a doctor appointment platform, and a self-care app for
   people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals
   initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in
   significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was
   followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for
   conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n <= 30) were developed, including
   aspects of community building, stakeholder engagement, mentoring,
   themes, announcements, follow-up, and timing for each step.
   Conclusions: This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing
   innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and
   potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital
   product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to
   other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led
   innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary
   hackathons.},

Abstract = {Despite the fact that hackathons and digital innovation contests have
   emerged as substantial intermediaries in open innovation and
   entrepreneurship, knowledge about how hackathons and digital innovation
   contests impact innovation in cities is restricted. There is also a
   scarcity of models that aid in the organization and evaluation of
   digital innovation contests. The purpose of this article is to examine
   the stages for organizing hackathons and digital innovation contests and
   identifies factors leading to the successful implementation of open data
   hackathons and digital innovation competitions. Three hackathons and
   innovation contests held in Thessaloniki between 2014 and 2018 were
   studied. The proposed framework provides practitioners with options to
   hold digital contests while also advancing the state of the art in the
   fields of open data and innovation competitions. Organizers of hackathon
   events may find this paper useful because they can learn about the
   factors that must be taken into account to ensure the success of these
   events.},

Abstract = {The advent of mobile DNA sequencers has made it possible to generate DNA
   sequencing data outside of laboratories and genome centers. Here, we
   report our experience of using the MinION, a mobile sequencer, in a
   13-week academic course for undergraduate and graduate students. The
   course consisted of theoretical sessions that presented fundamental
   topics in genomics and several applied hackathon sessions. In these
   hackathons, the students used MinION sequencers to generate and analyze
   their own data and gain hands-on experience in the topics discussed in
   the theoretical classes. The manuscript describes the structure of our
   class, the educational material, and the lessons we learned in the
   process. We hope that the knowledge and material presented here will
   provide the community with useful tools to help educate future
   generations of genome scientists.},

Title = {Beyond Open Data Hackathons: Exploring Digital Innovation Success},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Previous researchers have examined the motivations of developers to
   participate in hackathons events and the challenges of open data
   hackathons, but limited studies have focused on the preparation and
   evaluation of these contests. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to
   examine factors that lead to the effective implementation and success of
   open data hackathons and innovation contests. Six case studies of open
   data hackathons and innovation contests held between 2014 and 2018 in
   Thessaloniki were studied in order to identify the factors leading to
   the success of hackathon contests using criteria from the existing
   literature. The results show that the most significant factors were
   clear problem definition, mentors' participation to the contest, level
   of support to participants by mentors in order to launch their
   applications to the market, jury members' knowledge and experience, the
   entry requirements of the competition, and the participation of
   companies, data providers, and academics. Furthermore, organizers should
   take team members' competences and skills, as well as the support of
   post-launch activities for applications, into consideration. This paper
   can be of interest to organizers of hackathon events because they could
   be knowledgeable about the factors that should take into consideration
   for the successful implementation of these events.},

Title = {Emotion regulation in teamwork during a challenging hackathon:
   Comparison of best and worst teams},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 19},
Abstract = {Research has demonstrated the power of emotion regulation in managing
   challenges students face in different learning contexts. However,
   emotion research in team-learning where challenges become more evident
   is yet in its infancy. The current study examines case studies of two
   teams (high and low performing) in a hackathon where the task involved
   building a novel computer program to demonstrate a physics phenomenon;
   and explores how shared emotion regulation impacts teamwork and the
   types of challenges teams face (e.g., different goals/priorities;
   unreliable members; emotional imbalance; being off track, inefficient
   communication). Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze team
   interactions in terms of emotion regulation strategies student teams
   apply and the challenge types/levels they encounter. Comparative
   excerpts as well as descriptive statistics based on video data of
   student interactions, interview inputs, and responses to several
   questionnaires are provided to show differences among the cases. The
   team with higher shared emotional regulation mainly had external
   challenges that were less frustrating and demanding than relational
   challenges, while the team with lower shared regulation had internal
   challenges as well as external challenges and thus performed poorly. Our
   findings showed that when team members apply shared emotion regulation
   strategies, they build a cohesive atmosphere and synergistic team
   relationships that enable them to contribute to the overall team goals.
   This study also has implications for assisting educational teams in
   challenging environments. We hope that our paper will generate new ways
   of understanding and seeing shared emotion regulation in team settings.},

Title = {Global Leaders for Global Teams: Leaders with Multicultural Experiences
   Communicate and Lead More Effectively, Especially in Multinational Teams},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1554-1573},

Abstract = {In an era of globalization, it is commonly assumed that multicultural
   experiences foster leadership effectiveness. However, little research
   has systematically tested this assumption. We develop a theoretical
   perspective that articulates how and when multicultural experiences
   increase leadership effectiveness. We hypothesize that broad
   multicultural experiences increase individuals' leadership effectiveness
   by developing their communication competence. Because communication
   competence is particularly important for leading teams that are more
   multinational, we further hypothesize that individuals with broader
   multicultural experiences are particularly effective when leading more
   versus less multinational teams. Four studies test our theory using
   mixed methods (field survey, archival panel, field experiments) and
   diverse populations (corporate managers, soccer managers, hackathon
   leaders) in different countries (Australia, Britain, China, America). In
   Study 1, corporate managers with broader multicultural experiences were
   rated as more effective leaders, an effect mediated by communication
   competence. Analyzing a 25-year archival panel of English Premier League
   soccer managers, Study 2 replicates the positive effect of broad
   multicultural experiences using a team performance measure of leadership
   effectiveness. Importantly, this effect was moderated by team national
   diversity: soccer managers with broader multicultural experiences were
   particularly effective when leading teams with greater national
   diversity. Study 3 (digital health hackathon) and Study 4 (COVID-19
   policy hackathon) replicate these effects in two field experiments, in
   which individuals with varying levels of multicultural experiences were
   randomly assigned to lead hackathon teams that naturally varied in
   national diversity. Overall, our research suggests that broad
   multicultural experiences help leaders communicate more competently and
   lead more effectively, especially when leading multinational teams.},

Abstract = {This special communication describes activities, products, and lessons
   learned from a recent hackathon that was funded by the National Center
   for Advancing Translational Sciences via the Biomedical Data Translator
   program (`Translator'). Specifically, Translator team members
   self-organized and worked together to conceptualize and execute, over a
   five-day period, a multi-institutional clinical research study that
   aimed to examine, using open clinical data sources, relationships
   between sex, obesity, diabetes, and exposure to airborne fine
   particulate matter among patients with severe asthma. The goal was to
   develop a proof of concept that this new model of collaboration and data
   sharing could effectively produce meaningful scientific results and
   generate new scientific hypotheses. Three Translator Clinical Knowledge
   Sources, each of which provides open access (via Application Programming
   Interfaces) to data derived from the electronic health record systems of
   major academic institutions, served as the source of study data. Jupyter
   Python notebooks, shared in GitHub repositories, were used to call the
   knowledge sources and analyze and integrate the results. The results
   replicated established or suspected relationships between sex, obesity,
   diabetes, exposure to airborne fine particulate matter, and severe
   asthma. In addition, the results demonstrated specific differences
   across the three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, suggesting
   cohort- and/or environment-specific factors related to the services
   themselves or the catchment area from which each service derives patient
   data. Collectively, this special communication demonstrates the power
   and utility of intense, team-oriented hackathons and offers general
   technical, organizational, and scientific lessons learned.},

Title = {Assessments of students' gains in conceptual understanding and technical
   skills after using authentic, online learning modules on hydrology and
   water resources},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The need to adapt quickly to online or remote instruction has been a
   challenge for instructors during the COVID pandemic. A common issue
   instructors face is finding high-quality curricular materials that can
   enhance student learning by engaging them in solving complex, real-world
   problems. The current study evaluates a set of 15 web-based learning
   modules that promote the use of authentic, high-cognitive demand tasks.
   The modules were developed collaboratively by a group of instructors
   during a HydroLearn hackathon-workshop program. The modules cover
   various topics in hydrology and water resources, including physical
   hydrology, hydraulics, climate change, groundwater flow and quality,
   fluid mechanics, open channel flow, remote sensing, frequency analysis,
   data science, and evapotranspiration. The study evaluates the impact of
   the modules on students' learning in terms of two primary aspects:
   understanding of fundamental concepts and improving technical skills.
   The study uses a practical instrument to measure students' perceived
   changes in concepts and technical skills known as the Student Assessment
   of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. The survey was used at two-time points
   in this study: before the students participated in the module (pre) and
   at the conclusion of the module (post). The surveys were modified to
   capture the concepts and skills aligned with the learning objectives of
   each module. We calculated the learning gains by examining differences
   in students' self-reported understanding of concepts and skills from
   pre- to post-implementation on the SALG using paired samples t-tests.
   The majority of the findings were statistically at the 0.05 level and
   practically significant. As measured by effect size, practical
   significance is a means for identifying the strength of the conclusions
   about a group of differences or the relationship between variables in a
   study. The average effect size in educational research is d = 0.4. The
   effect sizes from this study {[}0.45, 1.54] suggest that the modules
   play an important role in supporting students' gains in conceptual
   understanding and technical skills. The evidence from this study
   suggests that these learning modules can be a promising way to deliver
   complex subjects to students in a timely and effective manner.},

Title = {Machine Learning Benchmarks for the Classification of Equivalent Circuit
   Models from Electrochemical Impedance Spectra},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {170},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for
   electrochemical systems often consists of defining an Equivalent Circuit
   Model (ECM) using expert knowledge and then optimizing the model
   parameters to deconvolute various resistance, capacitive, inductive, or
   diffusion responses. For small data sets, this procedure can be
   conducted manually; however, it is not feasible to manually define a
   proper ECM for extensive data sets with a wide range of EIS responses.
   Automatic identification of an ECM would substantially accelerate the
   analysis of large sets of EIS data. We showcase machine learning methods
   to classify the ECMs of 9,300 impedance spectra provided by QuantumScape
   for the BatteryDEV hackathon. The best-performing approach is a
   gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically
   generate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw
   spectral data. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of
   Nyquist representations is presented as an alternative, although it
   achieves a lower accuracy. We publish the data and open source the
   associated code. The approaches described in this article can serve as
   benchmarks for further studies. A key remaining challenge is the
   identifiability of the labels, underlined by the model performances and
   the comparison of misclassified spectra.},

   skills effectively combine to address questions faced by clinicians. The
   continuous peer review intrinsically provided by follow-up datathons,

   research, either by providing a different perspective on the study
   design and methodology or by replication of prior analyses.},

Abstract = {Libraries foster a thriving campus culture and function as ``third

   formal and informal learning, have multipurpose spaces, and serve as a

   ideal location for events, such as hackathons, that align with library
   priorities of outreach, data and information literacy, and engagement
   focused on social good. Hackathon planners could find likely partners in
   either academic or public libraries as their physical spaces accommodate
   public outreach events and many are already providing similar services,
   such as makerspaces. Libraries can act solely as a host for events or
   they can embed in the planning process by building community
   partnerships, developing themes for the event, or harnessing the
   expertise already present in the library staff. This article, focusing
   on years from 2014 to 2020, will highlight the history and evolution of
   hackathons in libraries as outreach events and as a focus for using

Abstract = {In silico approaches have acquired atoweringrole in pharmaceutical

   guided the choices of medicinal chemiststoward compounds displaying
   improved safety profiles. Even if therecent advances in the field are
   significant, many challenges remainactive in the on-target and
   off-target prediction fields. Machinelearning methods have shown their
   ability to identify molecules withsafety concerns. However, they
   strongly depend on the abundance anddiversity of data used for their
   training. Sharing such informationamong pharmaceutical companies remains
   extremely limited due to confidentialityreasons, but in this scenario, a
   recent concept named ``federatedlearning{''} can help overcome such
   concerns. Within this framework,it is possible for companies to
   contribute to the training of commonmachine learning algorithms, using,
   but not sharing, their proprietarydata. Very recently, Lhasa Limited
   organized a hackathon involvingseveral industrial partners in order to
   assess the performance oftheir federated learning platform, called
   ``Effiris{''}.In this paper, we share our experience as Roche in
   participating insuch an event, evaluating the performance of the
   federated algorithmsand comparing them with those coming from our
   in-house-only machinelearning models. Our aim is to highlight the
   advantages of federatedlearning and its intrinsic limitations and also
   suggest some pointsfor potential improvements in the method.},

Abstract = {Design effort is a key resource for product design projects.
   Environments where design effort is scarce, and therefore valuable,
   include hackathons and other time-limited design challenges. Predicting
   design effort needs is key to successful project planning; therefore,
   understanding design effort-influencing factors (objective
   considerations that are universally accepted to exert influence on a
   subject, that is, types of phenomena, constraints, characteristics, or
   stimulus) will aid in planning success, offering an improved
   organizational understanding of product design, characterizing the
   design space and providing a perspective to assess project briefs from
   the outset. This paper presents the Collaborative Factor Identification
   for Design Effort (CoFIDE) Method based on Hird's (2012) method for
   developing resource forecasting tools for new product development teams.
   CoFIDE enables the collection of novel data of, and insight into, the
   collaborative understanding and perceptions of the most influential
   factors of design effort levels in design projects and how their
   behavior changes over the course of design projects. CoFIDE also enables
   design teams, hackathon teams, and makerspace collaborators to
   characterize their creative spaces, to quickly enable mutual
   understanding, without the need for complex software and large bodies of
   past project data. This insight offers design teams, hackathon teams,
   and makerspace collaborators opportunities to capitalize on positive
   influences while minimizing negative influences. This paper demonstrates
   the use of CoFIDE through a case study with a UK-based product design
   agency, which enabled the design team to identify and model the behavior
   of four influential factors.},

Abstract = {Introduction Young people have played a pivotal role as part of the
   COVID-19 response, including developing health messages and social
   innovations. Social innovation in health engages multiple stakeholders
   in linking social change and health improvement. The study examined the
   feasibility of youth ideas and innovations to address the impacts of the
   COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative descriptive
   analyses.
   Methods In partnership with the WHO, academic institutions, youth
   organisations and civil society groups, we conducted a crowdsourcing
   open call among Filipino youth (15-30 years old) using a structured
   Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases/Social
   Innovation in Health Initiative process. The open call had three
   categories: youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID-19 world (entries
   were texts, images, videos and music), youth-led COVID-19 social
   innovations, and youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19.
   Each submission was evaluated by three independent judges. Finalists
   were selected in each of the categories alongside four grand winners.
   All finalists were invited to attend a 1day online civic hackathon.
   Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the
   post-COVID world=76; youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17; youth-led
   social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused
   on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon
   provided the participants mentorship for further development of their
   ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication
   campaigns and improved social innovations.
   Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response
   to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth
   voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation
   call is recommended.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in social media technologies offer a variety of tools
   for virtual teams to share knowledge among their team members and
   develop transactive memory systems (TMS). Adopting the media affordances
   lens, the current study investigates how social media affordances affect
   individual evaluations of TMS development and perceived team
   effectiveness in virtual teams. Survey data from 339 virtual team
   members across 92 hackathon events reveal that types of affordances have
   differing impacts on each of the three dimensions of TMS (perceptions of
   accuracy, sharedness, and validation). Furthermore, each dimension of
   perceived TMS mediates the relationship between its related social media
   affordance types and perceived team effectiveness. These findings
   suggest that virtual teams may need to adopt different social media
   technologies depending on which aspect of TMS development is
   prioritized.},

Title = {ITS plus DM Hackathon (ITSC 2017): Lane Departure Prediction With

Journal = {IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {On October 16th, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan, from 8:00 to 18:00, the first
   Intelligent Transportation Systems plus Data Mining challenge was
   organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation
   Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent
   Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a
   three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and
   the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from
   eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving
   problem: Lane Departure detection.
   This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions
   submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting,
   but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning
   after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon
   formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of
   class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the
   provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the
   inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to
   expect outstanding results - the best one was only slightly over 3\%
   above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities
   pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking
   into consideration for example computer power load of the different
   algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to
   share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned
   lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of
   view.},

Title = {Learning Models for Traumatic Brain Injury Mortality Prediction on
   Pediatric Electronic Health Records},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {BackgroundTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of
   injury related mortality in the world, with severe cases reaching
   mortality rates of 30-40\%. It is highly heterogeneous both in causes
   and consequences, complicating medical interpretation and prognosis.
   Gathering clinical, demographic, and laboratory data to perform a
   prognosis requires time and skill in several clinical specialties.
   Machine learning (ML) methods can take advantage of the data and guide
   physicians toward a better prognosis and, consequently, better
   healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop and test a wide
   range of machine learning models and evaluate their capability of
   predicting mortality of TBI, at hospital discharge, while assessing the
   similarity between the predictive value of the data and clinical
   significance. MethodsThe used dataset is the Hackathon Pediatric
   Traumatic Brain Injury (HPTBI) dataset, composed of electronic health
   records containing clinical annotations and demographic data of 300
   patients. Four different classification models were tested, either with
   or without feature selection. For each combination of the classification
   model and feature selection method, the area under the receiver operator
   curve (ROC-AUC), balanced accuracy, precision, and recall were
   calculated. ResultsMethods based on decision trees perform better when
   using all features (Random Forest, AUC = 0.86 and XGBoost, AUC = 0.91)
   but other models require prior feature selection to obtain the best
   results (k-Nearest Neighbors, AUC = 0.90 and Artificial Neural Networks,
   AUC = 0.84). Additionally, Random Forest and XGBoost allow assessing the
   feature's importance, which could give insights for future strategies on
   the clinical routine. ConclusionPredictive capability depends greatly on
   the combination of model and feature selection methods used but,
   overall, ML models showed a very good performance in mortality
   prediction for TBI. The feature importance results indicate that
   predictive value is not directly related to clinical significance.},

Title = {Combining iCn3D and NextStrain to create a novel undergraduate research
   experience around SARS-CoV-2 variants and commercial antibodies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN GENETICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Undergraduate research experiences are increasingly important in biology
   education with efforts underway to provide more projects by embedded
   them in a course. The shift to online learning at the beginning of the
   pandemic presented a challenge. How could biology instructors provide
   research experiences to students who were unable to attend in-person
   labs? During the 2021 ISMB (Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology)
   iCn3D Hackathon-Collaborative Tools for Protein Analysis-we learned
   about new capabilities in iCn3D for analyzing the interactions between
   amino acids in the paratopes of antibodies with amino acids in the
   epitopes of antigens and predicting the effects of mutations on binding.
   Additionally, new sequence alignment tools in iCn3D support aligning
   protein sequences with sequences in structure models. We used these
   methods to create a new undergraduate research project, that students
   could perform online as part of a course, by combining the use of new
   features in iCn3D with analysis tools in NextStrain, and a data set of
   anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We present results from an example project
   to illustrate how students would investigate the likelihood of
   SARS-CoV-2 variants escaping from commercial antibodies and use chemical
   interaction data to support their hypotheses. We also demonstrate that
   online tools (iCn3D, NextStrain, and the NCBI databases) can be used to
   carry out the necessary steps and that this work satisfies the
   requirements for course-based undergraduate research. This project
   reinforces major concepts in undergraduate biology-evolution and the
   relationship between the sequence of a protein, its three-dimensional
   structure, and its function.},

   for mass generation of ideas, rather than processes for developing
   proper design solutions. Information acquisition, gaining sufficient
   knowledge and generating feasible ideas are among the main challenges of
   collective design. In this study we applied three strategies of rapid
   design, informed participation, and knowledge sharing to overcome these
   challenges. During a one- week design hackathon, we conducted a
   collective design project in which three teams of participants conducted
   autoethnography research, shared their findings by an idea crowdsourcing
   platform, and tested their 3D printed prototypes with potential users.
   Although the tests showed efficiency of rapid design and informed
   participation strategy, we did not find knowledge sharing effective,
   mainly due to the absence of collaboration among teams.},

Title = {A process model of team emotion regulation: An expansion of Gross'
   individual ER model},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {33},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Coordination is at the heart of effective teamwork and contributes to
   shared mental models and mutual trust of team members (Salas, Sims, \&
   Burke, 2005). However, successful coordination does not always occur.
   This study examines the prerequisites for effective coordination and
   identifies the role of socially shared emotion regulation (SSER; Gross,
   2015) in the management of challenges that hinder the development of
   coordination. We examined 48 international participants who interacted
   in 16 teams of two to five in a two-day competitive and time-sensitive
   hackathon. A qualitative approach was used to identify the types of SSER
   strategies teams applied to overcome challenges that surfaced during the
   socio-emotionally challenging context. Findings resulted in a process
   model of ``team emotion regulation{''} that expands Gross's (1998)
   individual emotion regulation model. These findings have implications
   for enhancing performance in teams with coordination breakdowns by
   focusing on SSER strategies that can lead to the resolutions of
   challenges in complex collaborative settings.},

Title = {The educative model is changing: toward a student participative learning

Abstract = {Nowadays, different technological solutions are already embedded into
   higher education: Web platforms, collaborative cloud environments,
   massive online courses, the flipped classroom, intelligence collective,
   etc. Besides, the current implementation of the European Higher
   Education Area has opened the doors to these new and revolutionary
   techniques and proposes a strategic action plan for 2019 derived from
   digital transformation, through the promotion of a collaborative
   European hackathon. Among these solutions, wikis are proved to match
   perfectly the requirements of the future learning framework 3.0 in which
   the student is the protagonist of his/her own education. Thus, many
   different universities around the world are nowadays supporting
   activities and events about the edition of wikis. In this work, we are
   interested in a special and universal wiki, Wikipedia. This encyclopedia
   is often used for student learning in high schools and university
   classrooms. However, today, there are few educational university
   projects dedicated to the editing of articles, and even fewer to the
   editing of scientific articles. There is no literature, to the knowledge
   of the authors that gathers both. Therefore, this work has a double
   objective, on the one hand, to highlight the international educational
   projects in which this great encyclopedia is edited and improved,
   especially by indicating the theme of the chosen edition, edition dates
   and achievements. On the other hand, once the action framework has been
   introduced, we show the specific educational project, which has been
   working with students from the first courses of the Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) since 2009 and promoted by one of the
   authors. Finally, and to go into more detail, the authors analyze a
   particular educational experience about the Wikipedia edition carried
   out at the UPM in 2017. The results show that editing Wikipedia produces
   a relevant improvement in the five proposed objectives.},

Title = {Mining citizen emotions to estimate the urgency of urban issues},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {147-155},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Crowdsourcing technology offers exciting possibilities for local
   governments. Specifically, citizens are increasingly taking part in
   reporting and discussing issues related to their neighborhood and
   problems they encounter on a daily basis, such as overflowing trashbins,
   broken footpaths and lifts, illegal graffiti, and potholes. Pervasive
   citizen participation enables local governments to respond more
   efficiently to these urban issues. This interaction between citizens and
   municipalities is largely promoted by civic engagement platforms, such
   as See-Click-Fix, FixMyStreet, CitySourced, and OpenIDEO, which allow
   citizens to report urban issues by entering free text describing what
   needs to be done, fixed or changed. In order to develop appropriate
   action plans and priorities, government officials need to figure out how
   urgent are the reported issues. In this paper we propose to estimate the
   urgency of urban issues by mining different emotions that are implicit
   in the text describing the issue. More specifically, a reported issue is
   first categorized according to the emotions expressed in it, and then
   the corresponding emotion scores are combined in order to produce a
   final urgency level for the reported issue. Our experiments use the
   SeeClickFix hackathon data and diverse emotion classification
   algorithms. They indicate that (i) emotions can be categorized
   efficiently with supervised learning algorithms, and (ii) the use of
   citizen emotions leads to accurate urgency estimates. Further, using
   additional features such as the type of issue or its author leads to no
   further accuracy gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Public procurement of innovation is a key policy instrument for
   improving the quality of public services and achieving wider benefits
   for society. Recently, innovation contests have re-emerged as a means to
   procure innovative new solutions. There is, however, limited
   understanding of how innovation contests should be organized in the
   public sector. In this study, we investigate the organization of two
   smart city hackathon-style innovation contests in Tampere, Finland. We
   examine the contests' structure and goals, the definition of a problem
   statement, the motivation of potential participants, and their outcomes.
   We find that innovation contests may be used for, not only sourcing
   novel technologies, but also for engaging in conversations with
   companies, and developing an understanding of local problems and
   potential solutions. We further discuss the issues that arise from the
   integration of multiple goals in a single contest. We provide practical
   guidance for organizing innovation contests and evaluate their role for
   public procurement of innovation and local development.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The organization of open data hackathons or digital innovation
   competitions is a significant opportunity for nascent entrepreneurs to
   collaborate with external partners, promote new ideas and extend their
   applications to a new start-up. Prior studies have not thoroughly
   compared the execution of different strategies in many hackathons or
   digital innovation competitions. They only focus on the actions that the
   organizers of a specific hackathon have implemented or the challenges
   they have faced. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine goals and
   design strategies that contribute to the successful execution of open
   data hackathons and innovation competitions. Six case studies of open
   data hackathons and innovation competitions held between 2014 and 2018
   in Thessaloniki have been explored to understand the co-ordination
   between the multiple stakeholders of these events and improve the
   execution of open data hackathons and innovation competitions. The
   outcomes indicate that the most critical design strategy was the
   involvement of mentors in the event and the level of support provided to
   nascent entrepreneurs to accelerate their creativity, develop
   applications and launch their prototypes on the market.},

Journal = {CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Balancing value creation and value capture is a fundamental strategic
   issue for the management of open innovation. Insufficient compensation
   for created value may hinder the participation of a firm or individual
   in open innovation. It can thus provide an obstacle to the open
   innovation process as a whole. Hackathons provide an attractive setting
   for studying value appropriation in open innovation by actors of
   different types and with varying bargaining power. We define hackathons
   as idea competitions on specific topics in the form of a time-limited
   event. These competitions have gained more popularity throughout the
   years and have recently become more prominent. Therefore, an abductive
   empirical study was carried out in an international set-up with multiple
   embedded cases of hackathons. Results indicate that hackathons offer
   coupled open innovation processes. The value captured by the initiator
   of a hackathon in the form of inbound open innovation is balanced by
   outbound knowledge flows towards participants as well as with sideways
   knowledge flows between participants, which are a result of the
   generation of collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is thus
   identified as an alternative mechanism for value capture from open
   innovation.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a key tool in identifying and
   characterising disease-associated bacteria across clinical,
   agricultural, and environmental contexts. One increasingly common use of
   genomic and metagenomic sequencing is in identifying the type and range
   of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes present in bacterial isolates in
   order to make predictions regarding their AMR phenotype. However, there
   are a large number of alternative bioinformatics software and pipelines
   available, which can lead to dissimilar results. It is, therefore, vital
   that researchers carefully evaluate their genomic and metagenomic AMR
   analysis methods using a common dataset. To this end, as part of the
   Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon and Workshop 2021, a `gold standard'
   reference genomic and simulated metagenomic dataset was generated
   containing raw sequence reads mapped against their corresponding
   reference genome from a range of 174 potentially pathogenic bacteria.
   These datasets and their accompanying metadata are freely available for
   use in benchmarking studies of bacteria and their antimicrobial
   resistance genes and will help improve tool development for the
   identification of AMR genes in complex samples.},

Title = {Audio description of gender: self-description as an evocation of
   identity},
Journal = {PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 OCT 8},
Abstract = {Gender gets socially constructed in many visual ways, but people who are
   blind or who have low-vision want to know the gender of those around
   them, too, as well as other salient positionality details. Like with
   age, race, fashion, etc., a person's appearance can provide a lot of
   information about them and their character. Audio description, as a form
   of audiovisual translation, is a way to make that appearance accessible
   to those who cannot see it. Yet empirical research about audio
   description of gender - a complicated and highly contested arena of
   public discourse - is underdeveloped. This study addresses that issue
   through a Grounded Theory approach, constructivist in nature, that both
   generated self-descriptions of portrait images and piloted a model way
   to analyze them. This process prompted 179 new self-descriptions written
   during three hackathon-like events over multiple years, illuminating
   compositional gender-construction strategies as well as fertile paths
   for audio description research.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented shortage of personal
   protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers-especially
   respirators. In response to a lack of commercial respirator equipment, a
   multidisciplinary prototyping hackathon was held and the key components
   required to develop an inexpensive, scalable ``COVID-19 reusable
   elastomeric respirator{''} (RER-19) were identified. Available hospital
   supplies were assessed based on their published technical specifications
   to meet each of the key component requirements. The fully assembled
   prototype was then validated through user testing, and volunteers
   underwent standard fit testing with cardiopulmonary monitoring while
   wearing the RER-19 in a small pilot study. Multiple social media
   platforms were then used to disseminate educational information on
   respirator assembly, use, and maintenance. Here, we present our
   institution's initial experience with prototyping to meet a specific
   healthcare challenge, in combination with prompt dissemination of
   information to educate and empower healthcare workers in the face of a
   critical PPE shortage during an unprecedented and evolving pandemic.},

Title = {Healthcare Hackathons Provide Educational and Innovation Opportunities:
   A Case Study and Best Practice Recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Physicians and other healthcare professionals are often the end users of
   medical innovation; however, they are rarely involved in the beginning
   design stages. This often results in ineffective healthcare solutions
   with poor adoption rates. At the early design stage, innovation would
   benefit from input from healthcare professionals. This report describes
   the first-ever rehabilitation hackathon-an interdisciplinary and
   competitive team event aimed at accelerating and improving healthcare
   solutions and providing an educational experience for participants.
   Hackathons are gaining traction as a way to accelerate innovation by
   bringing together a diverse group of interdisciplinary professionals
   from different industries who work collaboratively in teams and learn
   from each other, focus on a specific problem ({''}pain point{''}),
   develop a solution using design thinking techniques, pitch the solution
   to participants, gather fast feedback and quickly alter the prototype
   design ({''}pivoting{''}). 102 hackers including 19 (18.6 \%) physicians
   and other professionals participated, and over the course of 2 days
   worked in teams, pitched ideas and developed design prototypes. Three
   awards were given for prototypes that may improve function in persons
   with disabilities. 43 hackers were women (42.2 \%) and 59 men (57.8 \%);
   they ranged in age from 16 to 79 years old; and, of the 75 hackers who
   reported their age, 63 (84 \%) were less than 40 years old and 12 (16
   \%) were 40 years or older. This report contributes to the emerging
   literature on healthcare hackathons as a means of providing
   interdisciplinary education and training and supporting innovation.},

Abstract = {The detailed understanding of tsunami hazard risk using numerical
   simulations requires a numerical model that can accurately predict
   tsunami inundation phenomena on land. In such models, the structural
   effects are indirectly considered using the variation of bottom
   roughness as a proxy for the differences in building densities. Only a
   few studies have conducted inter-model tests to investigate tsunami
   inundation in complex coastal urban cities. During the tsunami analysis
   hackathon held in September 2020, eight research groups met to have a
   detailed discussion on the current urban inundation problems. In this
   study, we conducted an intermodel comparison of the numerical tsunami
   models, using the data from physical experiments that were performed on
   a detailed urban model. Our objective was to investigate the necessary
   conditions of an accurate numerical model based that can ensure high
   reproducibility and practicality. It was confirmed that the accuracy of
   topographic data is an important parameter for tsunami inundation
   simulations in complex urban areas. Based on the computational cost and
   accuracy, we suggest that a resolution of 1 cm of topographic data is a
   sufficient condition for tsunami inundation simulations on 1/250 scale
   model.},

Abstract = {Open science and collaboration are necessary to facilitate the
   advancement of Parkinson's disease (PD) research. Hackathons are
   collaborative events that bring together people with different skill
   sets and backgrounds to generate resources and creative solutions to
   problems. These events can be used as training and networking
   opportunities, thus we coordinated a virtual 3-day hackathon event,
   during which 49 early-career scientists from 12 countries built tools
   and pipelines with a focus on PD. Resources were created with the goal
   of helping scientists accelerate their own research by having access to
   the necessary code and tools. Each team was allocated one of nine
   different projects, each with a different goal. These included
   developing post-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis
   pipelines, downstream analysis of genetic variation pipelines, and
   various visualization tools. Hackathons are a valuable approach to
   inspire creative thinking, supplement training in data science, and
   foster collaborative scientific relationships, which are foundational
   practices for early-career researchers. The resources generated can be
   used to accelerate research on the genetics of PD.},

Abstract = {Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex
   software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several
   studies have reported that periods of ``crunch time{''} are prevalent in
   the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of
   time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global
   Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results
   suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular
   method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration,
   minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up
   meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular
   communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning
   are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with
   agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in
   the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the
   development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some
   complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our
   findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit
   that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities.
   Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic ``crunch time{''} and
   argue that game jam organizers are in a good position to problematize
   the phenomenon.},

Title = {Prospects of environmental governance in addressing sustainability
   challenges of seawater desalination industry in the Arabian Gulf},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {50},
Pages = {145-154},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The hyper-arid climate of the Arabian Gulf makes it an excessively
   water-deficient region. Ironically, the Gulf States count among the few
   places with the highest per capita water consumption and low tariff.
   Since a few decades ago, seawater desalination has been the most
   reliable source of portable water in the Gulf. Recently, many critical
   scholars raise concerns about the rising levels of brine discharge,
   effects of water intake and outfall systems infrastructure, plants' high
   energy consumption and fragmented regulatory and policy frameworks. In
   this study, we explore the potentials of environmental governance in
   addressing sustainability risks of seawater desalination projects. The
   DPSIR model and the Earth system governance framework guided and
   supported our analysis of several multidimensional issues that underlie
   the characteristics of this industry. Thus, we identified 29 cause and
   effect factors as well as nine environmental governance intervention
   strategies. The study suggests that the industry's network of
   stakeholders can develop good ideas for fostering sustainability by
   using innovative tools such as hackathon-an interdisciplinary,
   participatory, solution-oriented, and consensus building platform.
   Finally, this study enjoins policymakers, businesses, and scientists to
   embrace more transparent, practical and holistic ideas in designing,
   executing and assessing technological innovations and interventions in
   national and regional water security initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessing accessibility: an instrumental case study of a community music

Journal = {MUSIC EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {350-363},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Creating accessible events is a pressing issue for many music
   organisations. In the United States, the term accessibility has strong
   ties to disability, and it is an important concept because what is
   deemed accessible directly impacts who is included and excluded from
   music experiences. Music Community Lab (MCL) runs a series of events in
   New York City called Monthly Music Hackathon NYC. They aim to promote
   `diversity across backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities'. This
   instrumental case study sought to examine how MCL participants
   conceptualise accessibility as well as analyze participants' suggestions
   for improving the accessibility of MCL events. Sixty-two people who
   attended one of three MCL events completed a demographic survey and 57
   of those respondents participated in an interview. Findings reveal that
   63\% (n = 36) of participants associated accessibility with inclusivity
   and 35\% (n = 20) of participants associated accessibility with ease of
   access to resources, places, and experiences. Participants' suggestions
   for improving accessibility included social media marketing (n = 23;
   40\%) and ease of access approaches (n = 11; 19\%) including CART, ASL,
   and live streaming events. Accessibility is challenging for community
   music groups like MCL to navigate because it is a complex construct with
   varied interpretations.},

Title = {Multi-faceted informatics system for digitising and streamlining the
   reablement care model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Reablement is new paradigm to increase independence in the home amongst
   the ageing population. And it remains a challenge to design an optimal
   electronic system to streamline and integrate reablement into current
   healthcare infrastructure. Furthermore, given reablement requires
   collaboration with a range of organisations (including national
   healthcare institutions and community/voluntary service providers), such
   a system needs to be co-created with all stakeholders involved. Thus,
   the purpose of this study is, (1) to bring together stakeholder groups
   to elicit a comprehensive set of requirements for a digital reablement
   system, (2) to utilise emerging technologies to implement a system and a
   data model based on the requirements gathered and (3) to involve user
   groups in a usability assessment of the system. In this study we
   employed a mixed qualitative approach that included a series of
   stakeholder-involved activities. Collectively, 73 subjects were
   recruited to participate in an ideation event, a quasi-hackathon and a
   usability study. The study unveiled stakeholder-led requirements, which
   resulted in a novel cloud-based system that was created using emerging
   web technologies. The system is driven by a unique data model and
   includes interactive features that are necessary for streamlining the
   reablement care model. In summary, this system allows community based
   interventions (or services) to be prescribed to occupants whilst also
   monitoring the occupant's progress of independent living. (C) 2015

Title = {Crowdsourcing Team Formation With Worker-Centered Modeling},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {Modern crowdsourcing offers the potential to produce solutions for
   increasingly complex tasks requiring teamwork and collective labor.
   However, the vast scale of the crowd makes forming project teams an
   intractable problem to coordinate manually. To date, most crowdsourcing
   collaborative platforms rely on algorithms to automate team formation
   based on worker profiling data and task objectives. As a top-down
   strategy, algorithmic crowd team formation tends to alienate workers
   causing poor collaboration, interpersonal clashes, and dissatisfaction.
   In this paper, we investigate different ways that crowd teams can be
   formed through three team formation models namely bottom-up, top-down,
   and hybrid. By simulating an open collaboration scenario such as a
   hackathon, we observe that the bottom-up model forms the most
   competitive teams with the highest teamwork quality. Furthermore, we
   note that bottom-up approaches are particularly suitable for populations
   with high-risk appetites (most workers being lenient toward exploring
   new team configurations) and high degrees of homophily (most workers
   preferring to work with similar teammates). Our study highlights the
   importance of integrating worker agency in algorithm-mediated team
   formation systems, especially in collaborative/competitive settings, and
   bears practical implications for large-scale crowdsourcing platforms.},

Abstract = {Background: Mapping out the research landscape around a project is often
   time consuming and difficult.
   Objective: This study evaluates a commercial artificial intelligence
   (AI) search engine (IRIS.AI ) for its applicability in an automated
   literature search on a specific medical topic.
   Methods: To evaluate the AI search engine in a standardized manner, the
   concept of a science hackathon was applied. Three groups of researchers
   were tasked with performing a literature search on a clearly defined
   scientific project. All participants had a high level of expertise for
   this specific field of research. Two groups were given access to the AI
   search engine IRIS.AI . All groups were given the same amount of time
   for their search and were instructed to document their results. Search
   results were summarized and ranked according to a predetermined scoring
   system.
   Results: The final scoring awarded 49 and 39 points out of 60 to AI
   groups 1 and 2, respectively, and the control group received 46 points.
   A total of 20 scientific studies with high relevance were identified,
   and 5 highly relevant studies ({''}spot on{''}) were reported by each
   group.
   Conclusions: AI technology is a promising approach to facilitate
   literature searches and the management of medical libraries. In this
   study, however, the application of AI technology lead to a more focused
   literature search without a significant improvement in the number of
   results.},

Title = {Iterative Coordination and Innovation: Prioritizing Value over Novelty},
Journal = {ORGANIZATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 OCT 11},
Abstract = {An innovating organization faces the challenge of how to prioritize
   distinct goals of novelty and value, both of which underlie innovation.
   Popular practitioner frameworks like Agile management suggest that
   organizations can adopt an iterative approach of frequent-meetings to
   prioritize between these goals, a practice we refer to as iterative
   coordination. Despite iterative coordination's widespread use in
   innovation management, its effects on novelty and value in innovation
   remain unknown. With the information technology firm Google, we embed a
   field experiment within a hackathon software development competition to
   identify the effect of iterative coordination on innovation. We find
   that iterative coordination causes firms to implicitly prioritize value
   in innovation: Although iteratively coordinating firms develop more
   valuable products, these products are simultaneously less novel.
   Furthermore, by tracking software code, we find that iteratively
   coordinating firms favor integration at the cost of knowledge-creating
   specialization. A follow-on laboratory study documents that increasing
   the frequency and opportunities to reprioritize goals in iterative
   coordination meetings reinforces value and integration, while reducing
   novelty and specialization. This article offers three key contributions:
   highlighting how processes to prioritize among multiple performance
   goals may implicitly favor certain outcomes; introducing a new empirical
   methodology of software code version tracking for measuring the
   innovation process; and leveraging the emergent phenomenon of hackathons
   to study new methods of organizing.},

Title = {Development of an online research platform for use in a large-scale
   multicentre study},
Journal = {BJS OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Participation in research in beneficial but can be challenging at a
   participant, clinician and organisation level. A novel online
   recruitment and data collection platform has been designed to improve
   accessibility to research and reduce the burden for participants and
   centres. The pilot study has demonstrated the platform to be feasible,
   acceptable to patients and accurate. Useful template when resources
   limited.
   Background Participation in research can be beneficial for patients and
   healthcare providers, but may prove demanding at patient, clinician and
   organizational levels. Patient representatives are supportive of online
   research to overcome these challenges. The aim of this pilot study was
   to develop an online recruitment platform and test its feasibility and
   acceptability while evaluating the accuracy of participant-reported
   data.
   Methods The online research platform was developed in a 1-day
   `hackathon' with a digital design company. Women who underwent
   implant-based breast reconstruction in 2011-2016 were invited by letter
   containing the web address (URL) of the study site and their unique
   study number. Once online, participants learned about the study,
   consented, entered data on demographics, treatment received and
   patient-reported outcome measures (BREAST-Q (TM)), and booked an
   appointment for a single hospital visit for three-dimensional surface
   imaging (3D-SI). Real-time process evaluation was performed. The primary
   endpoint was recruitment rate.
   Results The recruitment rate was 40 per cent. Of the 100 women, 50
   logged on to the platform and 40 completed the process through to 3D-SI.
   The majority of discontinuations after logging on occurred between
   consenting and entering demographics (3 women, 6 per cent), and between
   completing the BREAST-Q and booking an appointment for 3D-SI using the
   online calendar (3 women, 6 per cent). All women completed the online
   BREAST-Q (TM) once started. Participants took a median of 23 minutes to
   complete the online process. Patient-reported clinical data were
   accurate in 12 of 13 domains compared with electronic records (95 per
   cent concordance). Process evaluation demonstrated acceptability.
   Conclusion The results of this pilot demonstrate the online platform to
   be acceptable, feasible, and accurate for this population from a single
   institution. The low-burden design may enable participation from centres
   with less research support and participants from hard-to-reach groups or
   dispersed geographical locations, but with online access.},

Title = {<i>EviAtlas</i>: a tool for visualising evidence synthesis databases},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Systematic mapping assesses the nature of an evidence base, answering
   how much evidence exists on a particular topic. Perhaps the most useful
   outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and
   their meta-data, along with visualisations of this database. Despite the
   rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis method,
   there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing
   interactive visualisations of systematic map databases. In April 2018,
   as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis
   Hackathon in Stockholm, we decided to address this issue by developing
   an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use) and
   Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible)
   tool for producing interactive, attractive tables and figures that
   summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes
   the ability to generate vital visualisations for systematic maps and
   reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit
   geographical information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that
   cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of studies
   belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing
   the nature of the evidence base, for example the number of studies
   published per year or number of studies per country. We believe that
   EviAtlas will provide a stimulus for the development of other exciting
   tools to facilitate evidence synthesis.},

Abstract = {In the past few years COVID-19 posed a huge threat to healthcare systems
   around the world. One of the first waves of the pandemic hit Northern
   Italy severely resulting in high casualties and in the near breakdown of
   primary care. Due to these facts, the Covid CXR Hackathon-Artificial
   Intelligence for Covid-19 prognosis: aiming at accuracy and
   explainability challenge had been launched at the beginning of February
   2022, releasing a new imaging dataset with additional clinical metadata
   for each accompanying chest X-ray (CXR). In this article we summarize
   our techniques at correctly diagnosing chest X-ray images collected upon
   admission for severity of COVID-19 outcome. In addition to X-ray
   imagery, clinical metadata was provided and the challenge also aimed at
   creating an explainable model. We created a best-performing, as well as,
   an explainable model that makes an effort to map clinical metadata to
   image features whilst predicting the prognosis. We also did many
   ablation studies in order to identify crucial parts of the models and
   the predictive power of each feature in the datasets. We conclude that
   CXRs at admission do not help the predicting power of the metadata
   significantly by itself and contain mostly information that is also
   mutually present in the blood samples and other clinical factors
   collected at admission.},

Abstract = {Assessing the risk of tsunami-driven debris has increasingly been
   recognized as an important design consideration. The recent ASCE/SEI7-16
   standard Chapter 6 requires all the areas included within a 22.5.
   spreading angle from the debris source to consider the debris impact.
   However, it would be more reasonable to estimate the risks using
   numerical simulation models. Although a number of simulation models to
   predict tsunami debris transport have been proposed individually,
   comparative studies for these simulation models have rarely been
   conducted. Thus, in the present study, an inter-model comparison for
   tsunami debris simulation model was performed as a part of the virtual
   Tsunami Hackathon held in Japan from September 1 to 3 in 2020. The blind
   benchmarking experiment, which recorded the transport of three container
   models under a tsunami-like bore, was conducted to generate a unique
   dataset. Then, four different numerical models were applied to reproduce
   the experiments. Simulated results demonstrated considerable differences
   among the simulation models. Essentially, the importance of accurate
   modelling of a flow field, especially a tsunami front, was confirmed to
   be important in simulating debris motion. Parametric studies performed
   in each model and comparisons between different models also confirmed
   that a drag coefficient and inertia coefficient would influence the
   simulated debris trajectory and velocity. It was also shown that two-way
   coupled modelling to express the interaction between debris and a
   tsunami is important to accurately model the debris motion.},

Abstract = {The transactive memory system has been studied extensively, yet we still
   know little about how it influences the effectiveness of temporary
   teams. Additionally, little is known about the boundary conditions of
   the well-established benefits of transactive memory systems on team
   performance. Our primary goal in this study is to build and test a
   theory that investigates the influence of a transactive memory system on
   the performance of temporary teams while accounting for conditional
   effects of both task and relationship conflict. On the surface, a
   transactive memory systems perspective may seem incompatible with
   temporary teams. Transactive memory systems typically require time or
   team member familiarity to develop. However, team members on temporary
   teams often are selected because of their expertise, not team member
   familiarity, and often must quickly and effectively operate under time
   and outcome pressures. We present a theory that suggests transactive
   memory systems should have a meaningful influence on temporary teams,
   and its effect is accentuated in the presence of task conflict and
   attenuated in the presence of relationship conflict. We test our theory
   using a sample of 202 teams participating in the Global Game Jam, the
   world's largest hackathon devoted to designing and developing games
   within a 48-h period. In addition to implications for literatures on
   transactive memory systems and temporary teams, our study adds to a
   growing literature providing practical advice and insight regarding
   hackathons, a pervasive source of innovation and idea generation.},

Title = {VARMAN: Multi-plane security framework for software defined networks},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {148},
Pages = {215-239},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In the context of future networking technologies, Software-Defined
   paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic
   orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable
   control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN
   operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities,
   security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture
   itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data
   centers, we propose a collaborative ``Network Security and Intrusion
   Detection System(NIDS){''} scheme called ``VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne
   secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks'. The SDN security
   scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the
   dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric
   DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained
   hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It
   is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of
   NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory
   requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these
   problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid
   model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are
   implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack
   prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering,
   feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the
   practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters,
   we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset,
   and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of
   normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by
   organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network
   hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is
   capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98\%
   under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller
   interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70\% on an
   average, and controller response time reduces by 40\%, without incurring
   additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in
   SDN stack. The comparisons of VARMAN under similar attack scenarios and
   test environment, with related recent works that utilized ML-based NIDS,
   demonstrate that our scheme offers higher accuracy, less than 5\% false
   positive rate for various attack intensities and significant training
   space/time reduction.},

Title = {Entrofy your cohort: A transparent method for diverse cohort selection},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 27},
Abstract = {Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and
   beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, and choosing
   speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect
   the selection of any particular candidate, and, thereby the composition
   of the final cohort. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,entrofy,
   designed to be part of a human-in-the-loop decision making strategy
   aimed at making cohort selection as just, transparent, and accountable
   as possible. We suggest embeddingentrofyin a two-step selection
   procedure. During a merit review, the committee selects all applicants,
   submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria.
   This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the
   second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool
   via a new algorithm and software tool calledentrofy.entrofyoptimizes
   differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human
   committee. Criteria could include academic discipline, home country,
   experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable
   characteristics. Theentrofyalgorithm then yields the approximation of
   pre-defined target proportions for each category by solving the
   tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show
   howentrofyselects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in
   simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study
   of Astro Hack Week. This two stage candidate and cohort selection
   process allows human judgment and debate to guide the assessment of
   candidates' merit in step 1. Then the human committee defines relevant
   diversity criteria which will be used as computational parameters
   inentrofy. Once the parameters are defined, the set of candidates who
   meet the minimum threshold for merit are passed through theentrofycohort
   selection procedure in step 2 which yields a cohort of a composition as
   close as possible to the computational parameters defined by the
   committee. This process has the benefit of separating the meritorious
   assessment of candidates from certain elements of their diversity and
   from some considerations around cohort composition. It also increases
   the transparency and auditability of the process, which enables, but
   does not guarantee, fairness. Splitting merit and diversity
   considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to
   explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected, though it does
   not eliminate the possibility of objectionable bias.},

Title = {Community-engaged mHealth intervention to increase uptake of HIV
   pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among gay, bisexual and other men who
   have sex with men in China: study protocol for a pilot randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction The large number of key populations in China who would
   benefit from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the context of
   limited health system capacity and public awareness will pose challenges
   for timely PrEP scale-up, suggesting an urgent need for innovative and
   accessible interventions. This study aims to develop and pilot test a
   theory-informed, tailored mobile phone intervention that was codeveloped
   by young gay men, HIV clinicians and public health researchers to
   increase engagement in PrEP education and initiation among Chinese gay,
   bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who bear a
   disproportionate burden of HIV infections and remain underserved in the
   healthcare system.
   Methods and analysis This two-phase study includes a formative
   assessment using in-depth interviews (N=30) and a 12-week experimental
   pilot study using a two-arm randomised controlled trial design (N=70).
   The primary intervention is delivered through a WeChat-based mini-app (a
   program built into a Chinese multipurpose social media application)
   developed by young GBMSM from a 2019 crowdsourcing hackathon. Using
   mixed methods, we will further investigate the specific needs and
   concerns among GBMSM in terms of using PrEP as an HIV prevention
   strategy, how their concerns and PrEP use behaviours may change with
   exposure to the mini-app intervention during the study period and how we
   can further refine this intervention tool to better meet GBMSM's needs
   for broader implementation.
   Ethics and dissemination This study and its protocols have been reviewed
   and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of
   North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA (19-3481), the Guangdong Provincial
   Dermatology Hospital, China (2020031) and the Guangzhou Eighth People's
   Hospital, China (202022155). Study staff will work with local GBMSM
   community-based organisations to disseminate the study results to
   participants and the community via social media, workshops and journal
   publications.},

Abstract = {Background Recent research has established virtual reality (VR)
   applications as a valid and viable tool for neuropsychological
   assessment. In contrast, there are only a few studies on its potential
   as a therapeutic program. To examine the prospects of VR as a tool for
   functional rehabilitation, a VR training program of attentional
   functions was conceptualized during a Hackathon in 2018. The prototype
   of the immersive VR training program takes the patient on a virtual
   journey around the world (VR Traveller). In different locations around
   the globe, patients exercise different subcomponents of attention in a
   visually appealing and ecologically valid environment. Objective To
   evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and tolerability of the newly
   developed VR Traveller prototype for neurorehabilitation training.
   Method Thirty-five patients with acquired brain injury and mild to
   moderate attention deficits were instructed to complete the VR Traveller
   training program in a 20-30 min session during inpatient
   neurorehabilitation. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed with
   the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) and a self-constructed
   feasibility questionnaire, and tolerability was assessed with the
   virtual reality sickness questionnaire (VRSQ). Results Analyses of the
   UEQ and the feasibility questionnaire yield evidence for a high
   acceptance among most patients. The VRSQ data suggest that symptoms of
   VR sickness were hardly experienced. Conclusion Patients' ratings of the
   VR training in terms of acceptability and feasibility were positive,
   suggesting that VR programs represent an accepted, feasible, and
   well-received alternative to traditional cognitive rehabilitation
   approaches.},

   library websites, thematic resources (MIT Media Lab Research portal,
   websites of software development corporations and official virtual
   reality hackathon websites), professional publications covering the
   specifics of immersive technologies, experience in their use in
   scholarly research and library practice. Systemic, functional methods,
   methods of observation, hypotheses in combination with the social
   communication method have been used.
   Results. The expediency of introduction of immersive technologies into
   the practice of scientific libraries as an innovative tool of
   information and technological support of science and education
   development has been shown. The cognitive potential of immersive
   technologies has been emphasized. Theoretical and methodological
   frameworks for organization of complex library and information service
   based on immersive technologies have been developed. Case studies of
   efficient use of these frameworks by scientific libraries have been
   given.
   Conclusions. The positive effect of using the cognitive potential of
   extended reality in educational practice and research actualizes the
   development of strategies for organizing a comprehensive library and
   information service in scientific libraries to provide access to
   immersive technologies.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the possibility of practical
   use of the Hackathon Platform for ecological protection of the
   university biosystem to prevent a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affects companies and population's
   behaviour. The most significant change occurred in the attitude of
   companies to the environment from technical and technological points of
   view. To increase their production sustainability, these companies are
   looking at the possibilities of waste recovery through sustainable
   recycling, or recovery of waste as a source of secondary raw material.
   One of the simplest ways is to use agricultural waste for energy
   purposes, bringing bioenergy to the forefront as a new area of Industry
   4.0. The ALARA model was used to assess the quality of six biosystem
   components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, the level of
   land pollution with chemicals and littering by the unauthorized dumps;
   sufficient volume of green planting on the territory). This allowed the
   development of management decisions and environmental protection
   measures based on the system of calculated indicators of potential
   environmental damage for each of six biosystem components. The forecast
   of plan implementation: the quality of four from among six biosystem
   components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, sufficient
   volume of green planting on the territory) will increase on average by
   30-40\%. A minor improvement in the quality of the other biosystem
   components (approx. by 10\%) raises concerns about the high probability
   of a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Title = {The Role of Art in Emotional-Moral Reflection on Risky and Controversial
   Technologies: the Case of BNCI},
Journal = {ETHICAL THEORY AND MORAL PRACTICE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Pages = {275-289},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this article, we explore the role that art can play in ethical
   reflection on risky and controversial technologies. New technologies
   often give rise to societal controversies about their potential risks
   and benefits. Over the last decades, social scientists, psychologists,
   and philosophers have criticized quantitative approaches to risk on the
   grounds that they oversimplify its societal and ethical implications.
   There is broad consensus amongst these scholars that stakeholders and
   their values and concerns should be included in decision-making about
   technological risks. It has also been argued that the emotional
   responses of people can shed important light on the ethical aspects of
   risk and uncertainty. However, people's emotions can be narrowly focused
   and biased. This article therefore assesses the role that
   technology-inspired artworks can play in overcoming such biases, by
   challenging our imagination and providing us with different perspectives
   on possible technological developments and their implications for
   society. Philosophers have not yet studied such artworks, so this
   constitutes an entirely new field of research for scholars of risk and
   moral theory. In particular, we focus on the case of BNCI (Brain/Neural
   Computer Interface) technologies and related artworks. These
   technologies and artworks touch on questions of what it means to be
   human, thereby raising profound ethical and philosophical challenges. We
   discuss the experiences of artists, scientists, and engineers who are
   directly involved with BNCI technologies, and who were interviewed
   during a Hackathon at Amsterdam's Waag Society in June 2016. Their views
   are analyzed in light of philosophical and aesthetic theories, which
   allows us to consider relevant ethical and conceptual issues as well as
   topics for further investigation.},

Title = {Perspectives on Great Lakes coastal management: A case study of the
   Point Pelee foreland, Canada},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {228},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coastal systems on the Laurentian Great Lakes are highly affected by
   meter scale variability in water levels that occur across a range of
   temporal scales, from hourly wind set-up and seiches to inter-annual
   highs and lows driven by longer-term patterns of precipitation and
   evaporation. High lake level periods are often associated with increased
   coastal erosion and flooding, stress on sensitive wetland ecosystems,
   and damage to infrastructure. During the late 2010s, water levels on the
   Great Lakes neared or exceeded record highs, initiating a renewed
   interest in coastal management across the region. The objective of this
   study was to inform and engage regional experts and local interest
   groups and to examine their perspectives on the important processes,
   coastal man-agement solutions, and applied research needed for the
   conservation of the Point Pelee (PP) foreland in Lake Erie. A virtual
   conference, the Point Pelee `Hackathon,' used a crowd-sourced approach
   to problem solving where participants were presented `the sum of the
   discourse,' or the current state of knowledge on coastal processes and
   management affecting the region. The conference covered a range of
   topics through invited speaker pre-sentations, followed by individual
   surveys and moderated group discussions. Q-methodology surveys
   incorpo-rated concepts informed by the sum of the discourse and
   identified statistically significant sources of agreement and
   disagreement on management challenges and solutions among `like-minded'
   individuals. Common view-points identified harbours \& jetties and
   sediment nourishment projects as an important cause of erosion and
   mitigation strategy, whereas highly opposed viewpoints were held on the
   importance of sediment supply and adopting a `do-nothing' approach for
   coastal management. Emergent and more nuanced viewpoints were also found
   within group discussions, highlighting important considerations that can
   be used to advance the discourse on proposed management solutions. The
   results of this study can be used to guide the development of a regional
   coastal management strategy, and a similar methodology can be used to
   inform and engage stakeholders and examine perspectives on a range of
   issues affecting the world's marine and lacustrine coasts.},

Title = {Promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African context},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {541-565},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an intervention strategy
   for promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African
   context, followed by a reflection thereof based on qualitative data
   collected from students. Career awareness during study has shown to be a
   factor in the work-readiness of IT graduates.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper suggests an intervention strategy
   aimed at promoting IT students' career awareness. It provides context of
   the exit-level higher education (HE) module used to implement the
   intervention. Career awareness is achieved by industry talks, projects
   and events. Interpretive data collection and content analysis are used
   to understand the impact of the intervention from the students'
   perspective. Findings Recommendations are made towards productive
   interventions for raising career awareness among IT students using
   industry participation in higher education. The proposed intervention
   comprises of a combination of industry talks, capstone projects and
   specific events. Students had largely positive reactions and made
   suggestions for additional interventions they would find beneficial. A
   hackathon attended proved the most influential where seven out of eight
   involved students received job offers from one company. Other students
   became aware of their own employability, limitations and preferred
   career paths. Originality/value Findings provide confirmation on
   existing feasible approaches and also introduces new interventions that
   may be generalised to other fields of study. The paper not only provides
   an instructional design for a module to raise career awareness but also
   reflects on the feedback of the students. The reflection provided by
   students acts as a point of reference to ensure that the process
   followed for the intervention is practical within a South African
   context. The paper highlights the perceived benefits of involving
   industry in higher education to raise career awareness, factors that may
   prevent career awareness among IT students and valuable suggestions made
   by students to further enhance the intervention strategy. An implication
   of the research is a set of guidelines identified towards bridging the
   IT theory-practice gap. These guidelines can be used by many educators
   in similar environments to justify their interventions.},

Title = {Developing reproducible bioinformatics analysis workflows for
   heterogeneous computing environments to support African genomics},
Journal = {BMC BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {19},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Background: The Pan-African bioinformatics network, H3ABioNet, comprises
   27 research institutions in 17 African countries. H3ABioNet is part of
   the Human Health and Heredity in Africa program (H3Africa), an
   African-led research consortium funded by the US National Institutes of
   Health and the UK Wellcome Trust, aimed at using genomics to study and
   improve the health of Africans. A key role of H3ABioNet is to support
   H3Africa projects by building bioinformatics infrastructure such as
   portable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows for use on
   heterogeneous African computing environments. Processing and analysis of
   genomic data is an example of a big data application requiring complex
   interdependent data analysis workflows. Such bioinformatics workflows
   take the primary and secondary input data through several
   computationally-intensive processing steps using different software
   packages, where some of the outputs form inputs for other steps.
   Implementing scalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows
   is particularly challenging.
   Results: H3ABioNet has built four workflows to support (1) the calling
   of variants from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) the analysis of
   microbial populations from 16S rDNA sequence data; (3) genotyping and
   genome-wide association studies; and (4) single nucleotide polymorphism
   imputation. A week-long hackathon was organized in August 2016 with
   participants from six African bioinformatics groups, and US and European
   collaborators. Two of the workflows are built using the Common Workflow
   Language framework (CWL) and two using Nextflow. All the workflows are
   containerized for improved portability and reproducibility using Docker,
   and are publicly available for use by members of the H3Africa consortium
   and the international research community.
   Conclusion: The H3ABioNet workflows have been implemented in view of
   offering ease of use for the end user and high levels of reproducibility
   and portability, all while following modern state of the art
   bioinformatics data processing protocols. The H3ABioNet workflows will
   service the H3Africa consortium projects and are currently in use. All
   four workflows are also publicly available for research scientists
   worldwide to use and adapt for their respective needs. The H3ABioNet
   workflows will help develop bioinformatics capacity and assist genomics
   research within Africa and serve to increase the scientific output of
   H3Africa and its Pan-African Bioinformatics Network.},

Title = {A `Grantathon' model to mentor new investigators in mental health
   research},
Journal = {HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background: There is a critical gap between needs and available
   resources for mental health treatment across the world, particularly in
   low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In countries committed to
   increasing resources to address these needs it is important to conduct
   research, not only to assess the depth of mental health needs and the
   current provision of public and private mental health services, but also
   to examine implementation methods and evaluate mental health approaches
   to determine which methods are most effective in local contexts.
   However, research resources in many LMICs are inadequate, largely
   because conventional research training is time-consuming and expensive.
   Adapting a hackathon model may be a feasible method of increasing
   capacity for mental health services research in resource-poor countries.
   Methods: To explore the feasibility of this approach, we developed a
   `grantathon', i.e. a research training workshop, to build capacity among
   new investigators on implementation research of Indian government-funded
   mental health programmes, which was based on a need expressed by
   government agencies. The workshop was conducted in Delhi, India, and
   brought together junior faculty members working in mental health
   services settings throughout the country, experienced international
   behavioural health researchers and representatives of the Indian Council
   for Medical Research (ICMR), the prime Indian medical research funding
   agency. Pre- and post-assessments were used to capture changes in
   participants' perceived abilities to develop proposals, design research
   studies, evaluate outcomes and develop collaborations with ICMR and
   other researchers. Process measures were used to track the number of
   single-or multi-site proposals that were generated and funded.
   Results: Participants (n = 24) generated 12 single-or multi-site
   research grant applications that will be funded by ICMR.
   Conclusion: The grantathon model described herein can be modified to
   build mental health services research capacity in other contexts. Given
   that this workshop not only was conceptualised and delivered but also
   returned results in less than 1 year, this model has the potential to
   quickly build research capacity and ultimately reduce the mental health
   treatment gap in resource-limited settings.},

Title = {Situational Awareness of Large Infrastructures Using Remote Sensing: The
   Rome-Fiumicino Airport during the COVID-19 Lockdown},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Situational awareness refers to the process of aggregating
   spatio-temporal variables and measurements from different sources,
   aiming to improve the semantic outcome. Remote Sensing satellites for
   Earth Observation acquire key variables that, when properly aggregated,
   can provide precious insights about the observed area. This article
   introduces a novel automatic system to monitor the activity levels and
   the operability of large infrastructures from satellite data. We
   integrate multiple data sources acquired by different spaceborne
   sensors, such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series,
   Sentinel-2 multispectral data, and Pleiades Very-High-Resolution (VHR)
   optical data. The proposed methodology exploits the synergy between
   these sensors for extracting, at the same time, quantitative and
   qualitative results. We focus on generating semantic results, providing
   situational awareness, and decision-ready insights. We developed this
   methodology for the COVID-19 Custom Script Contest, a remote hackathon
   funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission
   (EC), whose aim was to promote remote sensing techniques to monitor
   environmental factors consecutive to the spread of the Coronavirus
   disease. This work focuses on the Rome-Fiumicino International Airport
   case study, an environment significantly affected by the COVID-19
   crisis. The resulting product is a unique description of the airport's
   area utilization before and after the air traffic restrictions imposed
   between March and May 2020, during Italy's first lockdown. Experimental
   results confirm that the proposed algorithm provides remarkable insights
   for supporting an effective decision-making process. We provide results
   about the airport's operability by retrieving temporal changes at high
   spatial and temporal resolutions, together with the airplane count and
   localization for the same period in 2019 and 2020. On the one hand, we
   detected an evident change of the activity levels on those airport areas
   typically designated for passenger transportation, e.g., the one close
   to the gates. On the other hand, we observed an intensification of the
   activity levels over areas usually assigned to landside operations,
   e.g., the one close to the hangar. Analogously, the airplane count and
   localization have shown a redistribution of the airplanes over the whole
   airport. New parking slots have been identified as well as the areas
   that have been dismissed. Eventually, by combining the results from
   different sensors, we could affirm that different airport surface areas
   have changed their functionality and give a non-expert interpretation
   about areas' usage.},

Title = {Public sector, open innovation, and collaborative governance in lockdown
   times. A research of Spanish cases during the COVID-19 crisis},
Journal = {TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT- PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Pages = {612-626},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to study the results of open innovation initiatives in
   Spain under the lockdown during the first stages of the COVID-19 crisis.
   Based on the most recent literature on open innovation in the public
   sector, this paper explores the following research questions, namely,
   what are the key features of collaborative governance processes that
   guided open innovation initiatives in the Spanish public sector during
   the COVID-19 crises? How open public innovation cases generated public
   value to the society during the COVID-19 crises in Spain?
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is based on two in-depth case studies of open innovation in
   the public sector: the collaborative platform Frena la Curva and the
   hackathon Vence al Virus, both launched during the first moments of the
   COVID-19 crisis. The methodology is based on 13 semi-structured
   interviews, content observation and documentary analysis. The data were
   interpreted according to the dimensions described in the analytical
   framework: descriptive dimensions of both initiatives but also their
   degree of elaboration, incentives and objectives, characteristics of
   governance and collaboration between actors and challenges for the
   accountability processes; and finally, their procedural legitimacy,
   considering the COVID-19 crisis context.
   Findings
   The results of the study show that citizens have played a key role
   during the hardest stage of the crisis, collaborating with governments
   and advancing their innovative capabilities, mostly in the digital
   sphere. The analysis also identified different outcomes, including the
   improvement of citizen's involvement, deliberation practices or network
   building. Besides, this paper has identified some limitations and
   barriers to open innovation and collaborative governance processes in
   terms of accountability and legitimacy of these initiatives. Here, their
   contribution was constrained by the emerging stage of implementation and
   by the unique circumstances of the lockdown under the COVID-19 crisis.
   Research limitations/implications
   Future advancements of open innovation initiatives to consolidate
   collaborative governance processes will need further exploration.
   Although this paper diversified the contacts and the data collection in
   the fieldwork to avoid social biases, the results of the interviews
   might reflect very positive outcomes. Despite the case studies that took
   place during the COVID-19 crisis and their planned actions to maintain
   their existence, the post-crisis analysis will be needed to assess the
   impact of these open innovation cases in collaborative governance
   structures.
   Practical implications
   Open innovation is an emerging narrative and practice in the public
   sector requiring time and energy from public officials and managers. The
   study also highlighted the problem of how to legitimate open innovation
   cases in the public sector and the implications for their
   institutionalization. Public managers involved in these types of
   initiatives need to keep the momentum both inside and outside their
   organizations. Regarding the utilization of information and
   communications technologies (ICTs), open innovation processes do not
   need technology to develop their full potential, whereas the COVID-19
   crisis and the ongoing digitalization of work settings, accessibility,
   etc., could transform ICTs into a critical tool for public managers
   leading innovation initiatives within their organizations.
   Social implications
   The social implications of this paper are manifold. This study provides
   evidence of one of the future avenues of public management: open
   innovation.
   New avenues for the involvement and collaboration of citizens with
   public authorities are another social implication pinpointed by this
   paper. Democratic legitimacy and procedural accountability are assessed
   using the open innovation case studies during the COVID-19 crisis.
   Finally, transforming governments using collaborative platforms deserves
   social oversight understanding if they really contribute to build trust
   in political institutions.
   Originality/value
   Despite their differences, both Frena la Curva and Vence al Virus
   demonstrated the potential and limitations of public innovation and
   collaborative governance to cope with an unprecedented crisis such as
   the COVID-19. The special features of this emergency, including the long
   period of confinement, posed challenges and also opportunities to
   develop these initiatives: as several interviewees stated, these
   projects helped to channel the civic energy to co-produce solutions in
   collaboration with a wide range of actors. Data allow us to identify the
   key features of collaborative governance that guided open innovation
   initiatives in the Spanish public sector during the COVID-19 crisis.},
