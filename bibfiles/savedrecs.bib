Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisted educational institutions
   extensively utilize electronic learning context to guarantee improved
   teaching and learning experiences accompanied by educational activities.
   E-learning or online learning plays a significant role in Chinese higher
   education. There is a challenge to implement e-learning in China's
   higher education to improve course resources, student learning style
   prediction, teaching quality, and service support. Hence in this paper,
   Artificial Intelligence based Efficient E-learning Framework (AI-EELF)
   has been proposed to overcome the challenges faced by China's higher
   education while implementing e-learning modules. The collected student
   data can be efficiently utilized and exploited to progress in an
   adaptive learning environment. The proposed AI-EELF method introduces
   multiple learning models to enhance teaching quality and predict the
   student learning style. The experimental results show that the proposed
   AI-EELF achieves high performance, prediction ratio in determining
   students' learning style and improves teaching quality compared to other
   existing methods.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant implications for higher
   education; however, references to AI in the literature are often vague
   and open to debate. In order to understand how to progress AI-related
   research and analysis, this critical review systematically searched top
   higher education journals for references to the term `artificial
   intelligence'. We reviewed definitions and conducted a discourse
   analysis of included texts. Our findings identify few, confusing
   definitions and little overt reference to AI as a research object. We
   delineated two Discourses. The Discourse of imperative change outlines
   how AI is seen as an inevitable change to which all must respond.
   Additionally, the Discourse of altering authority describes how texts
   position AI as decentring the teacher and spreading authority across
   staff, machines, corporations and students. Our analysis prompts a call
   for new research foci that attend to the social implications of AI,
   including tracing accountability in AI-mediated practices and exploring
   how AI influences learning and teaching relationships.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a very significant ability for students
   in the learning process, and SRL strategies are used to assist students
   in learning efficiently in higher education. Many SRL environments face
   challenges and barriers, including less immediate feedback and guidance,
   a high level of self-personalization, environment, and resources from
   teachers or learner designers. Hence, in this paper, the artificial
   intelligence framework for self-regulated learning (AIF-SRL) overcame
   the SRL environment's challenges in higher education. Self-regulated
   students are active participants in their learning and may select from a
   strategic portfolio and monitor their progress towards the objective.
   The proposed artificial intelligence-based solution has been used to
   monitor student behavior through students' feedback and responses. The
   experimental results show that the proposed AIF-SRL method improves the
   student's self-evaluation, self-regulation behavior, self-efficacy,
   learning gain, and self-satisfaction compared to other existing methods.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence applications in Latin American higher education:
   a systematic review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},

Month = {APR 18},
Abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been great research interest in the
   application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, such as
   medicine, finance, and law. Recently, there has been a research focus on
   the application of AI in education, where it has great potential.
   Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on AI in education is
   therefore necessary. This article considers its usage and applications
   in Latin American higher education institutions. After identifying the
   studies dedicated to educational innovations brought about by the
   application of AI techniques, this review examines AI applications in
   three educational processes: learning, teaching, and administration.
   Each study is analyzed for the AI techniques used, such as machine
   learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, the AI tools
   and algorithms that are applied, and the main education topic. The
   results reveal that the main AI applications in education are:
   predictive modelling, intelligent analytics, assistive technology,
   automatic content analysis, and image analytics. It is further
   demonstrated that AI applications help to address important education
   issues (e.g., detecting students at risk of dropping out) and thereby
   contribute to ensuring quality education. Finally, the article presents
   the lessons learned from the review concerning the application of AI
   technologies in higher education in the Latin American context.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence techniques, including
   machine learning models, have led to the expansion of prevailing and
   practical prediction simulations for various fields. The quality of
   teachers' performance mainly influences the quality of educational
   services in universities. One of the major challenges of higher
   education institutions is the increase of data and how to utilize them
   to enhance the academic program's quality and administrative decisions.
   Hence, in this paper, Artificial Intelligence assisted Multi-Objective
   Decision-Making model (AI-MODM) has been proposed to predict the
   instructor's performance in the higher education systems. The proposed
   AI-assisted prediction model analyzes the numerical values on various
   elements allocated for a cluster of teachers to evaluate an overall
   quality evaluation representing the individual instructor's performance
   level. Instead of replacing teachers, AI technologies would increase and
   motivate them. These technologies would reduce the time necessary for
   routine tasks to enable the faculty to focus on teaching and analysis.
   The usage for administrative decision-making of artificial intelligence
   and associated digital tools. The experimental results show that the
   suggested AI-MODM method enhances the accuracy (93.4\%), instructor
   performance analysis (96.7\%), specificity analysis (92.5\%), RMSE
   (28.1\%), and precision ratio (97.9\%) compared to other existing
   methods.},

Abstract = {This systematic review provides unique findings with an up-to-date
   examination of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE)
   from 2016 to 2022. Using PRISMA principles and protocol, 138 articles
   were identified for a full examination. Using a priori, and grounded
   coding, the data from the 138 articles were extracted, analyzed, and
   coded. The findings of this study show that in 2021 and 2022,
   publications rose nearly two to three times the number of previous
   years. With this rapid rise in the number of AIEd HE publications, new
   trends have emerged. The findings show that research was conducted in
   six of the seven continents of the world. The trend has shifted from the
   US to China leading in the number of publications. Another new trend is
   in the researcher affiliation as prior studies showed a lack of
   researchers from departments of education. This has now changed to be
   the most dominant department. Undergraduate students were the most
   studied students at 72\%. Similar to the findings of other studies,
   language learning was the most common subject domain. This included
   writing, reading, and vocabulary acquisition. In examination of who the
   AIEd was intended for 72\% of the studies focused on students, 17\%
   instructors, and 11\% managers. In answering the overarching question of
   how AIEd was used in HE, grounded coding was used. Five usage codes
   emerged from the data: (1) Assessment/Evaluation, (2) Predicting, (3) AI
   Assistant, (4) Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and (5) Managing
   Student Learning. This systematic review revealed gaps in the literature
   to be used as a springboard for future researchers, including new tools,

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important technology
   affecting the development of society and education, and it is crucial to
   explore AI to enhance students' creativity and learning performance.
   This research proposes the model and hypothesis based on the
   resource-based theory and related research. AI of higher education
   institute (HEI) affects students' learning performance and combines the
   existing literature to develop measurement tools and to obtain a formal
   questionnaire after pre-research and received 561 valid questionnaires
   collected from HEIs in China that have applied AI. Then we used SmartPLS
   3.0 to construct a partial least squares structural equation model
   (PLS-SEM) for data analysis on the received data samples. The research
   results show that: 1) HEIs' artificial intelligence capability is a
   three-order variable and formed by three formative second-order
   variables such as resources (data, technical, basic resources), skills
   (technical skills, teaching applications, collaboration competencies),
   and consciousness (reform, innovation consciousness); 2) HEIs'
   artificial intelligence capability significantly affects students'
   self-efficacy and creativity; 3) HEIs' artificial intelligence
   capability affects students' learning performance via two mediating
   variables: student creativity and self-efficacy. This study focuses on
   AI applications within the HEI, confirms the new explanatory power of
   resource-based theory in technological practices, and deconstructs the
   intrinsic mechanics, especially in relationships between students'
   creativity, self-efficacy, and learning performance. This research also
   puts forward suggestions to reserve and deploy artificial intelligence
   resources, improve the digital literacy of teachers and students, use AI
   to drive teaching and learning, and improve students' creativity and
   learning performance.},

Abstract = {The quality of management decisions is one of the main issues facing
   higher education institutions today. Strategic decisions taken by the
   higher education institutions affect policies, schemes, and actions that
   the institutions are considering. Machine learning is an emergent
   artificial intelligence field that utilizes different algorithms,
   analyses data, and delivers a better understanding of the data contained
   in a specific context. Hence, in this paper, data-driven decision-making
   model has been proposed based on artificial intelligence in colleges and
   universities. Student data, graduation rate and curriculum design have
   been analysed for administrative decision-making in college or
   university based on the machine learning method. With the availability
   of huge quantities and high-quality input training data,
   machine-learning progressions can attain precise outcomes and enable
   informed decision-making. The experimental findings show that the
   suggested model improves the outcome ratio of 90.72\%, the performance
   ratio of 97.62\%, prediction ratio of 96.35\%, decision-making level of
   95.51\%, accuracy ratio of 95.61\%, an efficiency ratio of 98.14\%,
   graduation rate of 85.86\%, data security rate (95.61\%) and error rate
   33.21\% compared to other methods.},

Abstract = {The term ``Artificial Intelligence{''} (AI) refers to the simulation of
   human intelligence on a computer. Higher education can benefit from AI
   because it is a computationally efficient paradigm. Learning adapted to
   the changing demands of students is one of the key educational
   advantages of AI. Students can modify the pace of a course to better
   competency. Poor faculty and teaching quality and a general lack of
   motivation and interest among students are among the difficulties facing
   higher education. An artificial intelligence-assisted integrated
   teaching-learning framework (AL-ITLF) for higher education is proposed
   in this research. Multiple tutoring services are also involved in the
   curriculum, which is skill-based. The extreme learning machine (ELM)
   technique evaluates designs integrated into the suitable student
   monitoring model weighted score (WS) and exam results. An educational
   model that is more efficient, adaptable, and effective than current
   traditional education has been developed due to AI research in higher
   education. Higher education's use of AI has resulted in a more
   efficient, adaptive, and effective educational model than traditional
   schooling. High accuracy, higher performance, lower processing costs,
   and a high prediction and low error rate are advantages of the suggested
   AI-ITLF approach. The WS and exam results were evaluated using an ELM
   algorithm as part of a proper student monitoring model.},

Abstract = {The way people travel, organise their time, and acquire information has
   changed due to information technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI)
   and machine learning (ML) are mechanisms that evolved from data
   management and developing processes. Incorporating these mechanisms into
   business is a trend many different industries, including education, have
   identified as game-changers. As a result, education platforms and
   applications are more closely aligned with learners' needs and
   knowledge, making the educational process more efficient. Therefore, AI
   and ML have great potential in e-learning and higher education
   institutions (HEI). Thus, the article aims to determine its potential
   and use areas in higher education based on secondary research and
   document analysis (literature review), content analysis, and primary
   research (survey). As referent points for this research, multiple
   academic, scientific, and commercial sources were used to obtain a
   broader picture of the research subject. Furthermore, the survey was
   implemented among students in the Republic of Serbia, with 103
   respondents to generate data and information on how much knowledge of AI
   and ML is held by the student population, mainly to understand both
   opportunities and challenges involved in AI and ML in HEI. The study
   addresses critical issues, like common knowledge and stance of research
   bases regarding AI and ML in HEI; best practices regarding usage of AI
   and ML in HEI; students' knowledge of AI and ML; and students' attitudes
   regarding AI and ML opportunities and challenges in HEI. In statistical
   considerations, aiming to evaluate if the indicators were considered
   reflexive and, in this case, belong to the same theoretical dimension,
   the Correlation Matrix was presented, followed by the Composite
   Reliability. Finally, the results were evaluated by regression analysis.
   The results indicated that AI and ML are essential technologies that
   enhance learning, primarily through students' skills, collaborative
   learning in HEI, and an accessible research environment.},

Title = {Systematic review of research on artificial intelligence applications in
   higher education - where are the educators?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in
   Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational
   technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still
   unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a
   broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching
   and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an
   overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a
   systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the
   period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final
   synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
   descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd
   papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative
   methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The
   synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in
   academic support services, and institutional and administrative
   services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3.
   adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring
   systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical
   reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to
   theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further
   exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of
   AIEd in higher education.},

Abstract = {As higher education institutions (HEIs) go online, several benefits are
   attained, and also it is vulnerable to several kinds of attacks. To
   accom-plish security, this paper presents artificial intelligence based
   cybersecurity intrusion detection models to accomplish security. The
   incorporation of the strategies into business is a tendency among
   several distinct industries, comprising education, have recognized as
   game changer. Consequently, the HEIs are highly related to the
   requirement and knowledge of the learner, making the education procedure
   highly effective. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
   learning (ML) models have shown significant interest in HEIs. This study
   designs a novel Artificial Intelligence based Cybersecurity Intrusion
   Detection Model for Higher Education Institutions named AICID-HEI
   technique. The goal of the AICID-HEI technique is to determine the
   occurrence of distinct kinds of intrusions in higher education
   institutes. The AICID-HEI technique encompasses min-max normalization
   approach to pre -process the data. Besides, the AICID-HEI technique
   involves the design of improved differential evolution algorithm based
   feature selection (IDEA-FS) technique is applied to choose the feature
   subsets. Moreover, the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)
   model is utilized for the detection and classification of intrusions in
   the network. Furthermore, the Adam optimizer is applied for
   hyperparameter tuning to properly adjust the hyperparameters in higher
   educational institutions. In order to validate the experimental results
   of the proposed AICID-HEI technique, the simulation results of the
   AICID-HEI technique take place by the use of benchmark dataset. The
   experimental results reported the betterment of the AICID-HEI technique
   over the other methods interms of different measures.},

Abstract = {Higher education provides a common educational pattern to all students
   in colleges and universities. However, under the general law of higher
   education, the teaching and education of a certain category or subject
   has its special regularity. Besides, students in colleges and
   universities have different demands of education. To address the
   challenges in higher education, it is very important to carry out higher
   education reform in colleges and universities. Personalized education
   has been considered to be a new educational model that is a result of
   the individual desire of students and the development of society.
   Traditional methodologies of teaching in colleges and universities
   cannot fulfill the implementation of personalized training. Hence, it is
   very urgent to develop new methodologies for personalized training.
   Among the methodologies of realization of personalized training,
   artificial intelligence is one of the most important methodologies. We
   exploit artificial intelligence for personalize education reform. First,
   we analyze the information of students before entering the colleges and
   universities. Then, we propose a method to extract modeling features of
   the student information. Second, we propose a method to build a
   personalized training model based on artificial intelligence. Third, we
   propose a method to predict the development track of students based on
   the personalized training model. On the basis of above designs, we
   design personalized training for students in colleges and universities.
   Furthermore, we implement our design by using artificial intelligence.
   Besides, our design can be applied to the career planning or related
   areas.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming
   increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry
   and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science {[}84]. The
   Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning
   and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack
   of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex
   domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge.
   We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and
   Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions,
   with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this
   area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics
   anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key
   factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and
   whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining
   to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine
   learning. This article shares the insights from both students and
   lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning
   education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies
   within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in
   teaching and learning of these topics.},

Abstract = {Education 4.0 is being authorized more and more by the design of
   artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Higher education institutions
   (HEI) have started to utilize Internet technologies to improve the
   quality of the service and boost knowledge. Due to the unavailability of
   information tech-nology (IT) infrastructures, HEI is vulnerable to
   cyberattacks. Biometric authentication can be used to authenticate a
   person based on biological fea-tures such as face, fingerprint, iris,
   and so on. This study designs a novel search and rescue optimization
   with deep learning based learning authentication technique for
   cybersecurity in higher education institutions, named SRODL-LAC
   technique. The proposed SRODL-LAC technique aims to authenticate the
   learner/student in HEI using fingerprint biometrics. Besides, the
   SRODL-LAC technique designs a median filtering (MF) based preprocessing
   approach to improving the quality of the image. In addition, the Densely
   Connected Networks (DenseNet-77) model is applied for the extraction of
   features. Moreover, search and rescue optimization (SRO) algorithm with
   deep neural network (DNN) model is utilized for the classification
   process. Lastly, tem -plate matching process is done for fingerprint
   identification. A wide range of simulation analyses is carried out and
   the results are inspected under several aspects. The experimental
   results reported the effective performance of the SRODL-LAC technique
   over the other methodologies.},

Abstract = {Within the framework of the ongoing implementation of the 2030 Vision
   for Comprehensive Development of Higher Education in Saudi Arabia, the
   integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal
   objective for the country's numerous higher education institutions. This
   study aims to examine the opportunities and challenges that arise from
   the adoption of AI-based learning outcomes in Saudi Arabia's higher
   education institutes. Moreover, the research also investigates the
   contribution of major higher education institutes in Saudi Arabia to the
   field of AI-based learning outcomes. To gather relevant literature, the
   Scopus and Web of Science databases were utilised, resulting in the
   selection of fifty-five studies for final analysis. The study employed
   the PRISMA statement 2020 for records filtration and utilised VOS viewer
   software to classify the literature on AI-based learning outcomes in
   Saudi Arabian universities. Through detailed analysis, three significant
   data streams were identified and examined. The findings indicate that AI
   is in a nascent stage within the realm of learning, and it has become an
   undeniable reality for higher education institutions. Embracing this
   transformative technology is crucial for meeting future learning
   challenges, and it is imperative that all students acquire the necessary
   technical skills to interact with and create artificial intelligence in
   the future. According to the findings, AI has the potential to address
   significant educational challenges, revolutionise teaching and learning
   methodologies, and accelerate progress toward the Saudi 2030 objectives.
   However, the study also highlights certain challenges associated with
   the implementation of AI-based learning in the higher education context
   of Saudi Arabia, emphasising the need for teachers to acquire new
   technological skills to effectively utilise AI pedagogically.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {As online learning has been widely adopted in higher education in recent
   years, artificial intelligence (AI) has brought new ways for improving
   instruction and learning in online higher education. However, there is a
   lack of literature reviews that focuses on the functions, effects, and
   implications of applying AI in the online higher education context. In
   addition, what AI algorithms are commonly used and how they influence
   online higher education remain unclear. To fill these gaps, this
   systematic review provides an overview of empirical research on the
   applications of AI in online higher education. Specifically, this
   literature review examines the functions of AI in empirical researches,
   the algorithms used in empirical researches and the effects and
   implications generated by empirical research. According to the screening
   criteria, out of the 434 initially identified articles for the period
   between 2011 and 2020, 32 articles are included for the final synthesis.
   Results find that: (1) the functions of AI applications in online higher
   education include prediction of learning status, performance or
   satisfaction, resource recommendation, automatic assessment, and
   improvement of learning experience; (2) traditional AI technologies are
   commonly adopted while more advanced techniques (e.g., genetic
   algorithm, deep learning) are rarely used yet; and (3) effects generated
   by AI applications include a high quality of AI-enabled prediction with
   multiple input variables, a high quality of AI-enabled recommendations
   based on student characteristics, an improvement of students' academic
   performance, and an improvement of online engagement and participation.
   This systematic review proposes the following theoretical,
   technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of
   educational and learning theories into AI-enabled online learning; (2)
   the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect and analyze
   real-time process data; and (3) the implementation of more empirical
   research to test actual effects of AI applications in online higher
   education.},

   widely formulated and applied in varying ways in education, particularly
   by universities/colleges. AI is primarily established as information
   technology, a shift to internet-based and online intelligent education
   systems, and, eventually, integrated computer systems, other
   technologies, robotic devices, and internet Talkbots to execute
   teachers' roles and duties individually or through instructors. Talkbots
   are limited to audio and text inputs. The Real-Time Communication and
   AI-multimedia service assistance to the learners and teachers helps the
   education for a higher level of performance. Another trending aspect of
   higher education is virtual reality or augmented reality. This research
   designs AI-assisted Real-Time Communication and AI-multimedia Services
   Framework (AI-RCMP) to support higher education in
   universities/colleges. The Recurrent- Convolutional Neural Network
   applies for information decoding from AI-multimedia resources and
   Dimensional Pose estimation from augmented reality objects. The
   simulation analysis performed for this framework results in 94.68\%
   accuracy. The other performance metrics such as precision, recall and F1
   score are evaluated in the research to compare the proposed model with

Abstract = {The integrated chatbot for artificial intelligence customizes the
   learning experience for the students in higher education platform. The
   chatbot tests the answers of the students and offers insights for the
   students to improve their learning skills. Further, It helps to improve
   students' thinking ability and expectations in higher education
   platform. The demanding factors for the students in the higher education
   platform include the need for interactive learning in a non-linear
   world, enhancing the thinking ability and expectations of the students.
   This paper proposes Artificial Intelligence Based Inquiry Evaluation
   Student Learning System (AI-IESLS) to increase interactive learning
   experience in a non-linear environment. The principal aim of this system
   is to improve the learning ability of the student on a specific subject
   using concept mapping in the chatbot. In addition, mapping has been
   validated for students based on the probability distribution analysis
   using a concept mapping. Besides, the probability graph's curve
   generated by this system assesses the student's understanding of the
   topic. The simulation results have been analyzed among students based on
   concept mapping using the AI-IESLS system in correlation with the
   traditional approach based on assessment ratio, feedbacks, reciprocity,
   timing analysis, expectation ratio, and active learning factor.},

Abstract = {Higher education in the Republic of Serbia needs to be reformed. This
   paper presents a performance analysis of the changes that the authors
   assume are mandatory, presenting the research problem this article
   addresses. Cabinet research, performed by analyzing the theoretical
   building blocks of available knowledge and experience, is underway.
   Articles and studies from various publications, such as academic
   journals and institutes, were used as sources. In addition, academic
   articles and papers and studies about artificial intelligence, machine
   learning, and extended reality were also consulted. The authors consider
   that these technologies could be of great assistance in developing a new
   higher education strategy. Further, this research is exploratory given
   that information from the 100 Serbian students from selected higher
   education institutions was used to better understand if these
   technologies are welcomed by students. Based on SmartPls software, the
   research analysis proved that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
   learning (ML) are appropriate technologies implemented in higher
   education institutions (HEI) to develop skills among students, a
   collaborative learning environment, and an accessible research
   environment. Additionally, extended reality (XR) facilitates increased
   motivation, engagement, and learning-by-doing activities between
   students, offering a realistic environment for learning.</p>},

   accelerator for the creation of teaching resources in Higher Education
   for non -engineering students, and to analyze its educatio-nal
   effectiveness based on an exploratory study de-veloped at the Regional
   Autonomous University of the Andes (UNIANDES), from Ecuador. A workflow
   consisting of 6 activities was proposed for the selec-tion and design of
   teaching resources with Artificial Intelligence. There was the
   participation of 12 tea-chers; 5 AI experts; and 38 fourth-year college
   students. The 5 experts delivered a cycle of three lectures on the
   concepts and use of AI in automatic assessment, which significantly
   improved AI literacy. The result of the survey shows that the
   application of AI-based teaching resources to non-engineering careers
   indicates that the attitude and learning mo-tivation to accept AI were
   high. Although the results were satisfactory, 15 challenges were
   identified for the creation of teaching resources with AI in Higher
   Education that will be part of future lines of research.},

Abstract = {Modern technology integration in higher education on the example of
   artificial intelligence use as a personalized learning platform can
   facilitate learning of various subjects. The research questions are
   explained by the desire to obtain new experimental data on the modern
   technology integration in higher education using artificial intelligence
   as an example, and based on the data obtained, to optimize and improve
   teaching approaches. The research aims to study the impact of artificial
   intelligence technologies in higher educational institutions of the
   People's Republic of China on improving education system. The study
   relies on experimental design to determine the effectiveness of
   implementing the Raptivity personalized learning platform by integrating
   statistical data analysis and paired t-test. The study involved 356
   students. The students demonstrated poor or average performance in the
   pre-assessment of all five subjects before the introduction of
   artificial intelligence technologies and average or high knowledge in
   the post-assessment. Students' post-assessment performance in
   mathematics increased by 22.9\%, computer science - by 18.4\%,
   management - by 13.4\%, English - by 14.7\%, sociology - by 13.7\%.
   According to the t-values that were calculated during the study, there
   is a significant difference in student performance in the five subjects
   before and after the Raptivity personalized learning platform
   introduction. Thus, the intervention in the form of artificial
   intelligence integration has demonstrated its effectiveness in the
   context of improving student performance in five humanities and exact
   subjects. This contributed to an increase in the learning process
   effectiveness. This research is of practical significance as it
   demonstrates the positive impact of the Raptivity personalized learning
   platform on students' performance. The results obtained confirm the need
   for the modern technology integration on the example of the artificial
   intelligence introduction in the education system of the People's
   Republic of China and other countries.},

Title = {Development of IOT-based methodology for the execution of knowledge
   management using artificial intelligence in higher education system},
Journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 22},
Abstract = {Knowledge management (KM) is the process used by businesses to collect,
   organize, and distribute information with customers, employees, business
   partners, and others. Higher education can greatly benefit from
   knowledge management, which can support high-level planning and
   innovation while increasing efficiency, productivity, collaboration, and
   employee happiness. Without the use of KM in higher education they
   suffer for many reasons such as security, motivating people, keeping up
   with technology, measuring knowledge, dominating shared leadership, etc.
   As a result, it can be concluded that knowledge management has the
   primary role of educational institutions. The present research focuses
   on developing an innovative methodology based on advanced technology
   including ``The Internet of Things{''} and ``Artificial Intelligence{''}
   for the effective performance of KM in higher education systems. With
   the help of technology, this research helps educational institutions to
   understand how to analyze, collect, classify, and store the tacit
   knowledge recorded and through various activities carried out in the
   institutions for the staff and students. This methodology will help to
   index, share, repackage, and store. For better results, additional
   research methodologies were explored. It was including a detailed survey
   of available literature and collecting data from primary and secondary
   sources. The methodologies were explored by an amalgamated approach of
   advanced technology adaptation integrated with KM strategies. The
   proposed approaches have the potential to enhance administrative and
   academic services at reduced time and financial costs in the higher
   education system. The objectives of the present study are to design an
   effective tool for knowledge management and to transform unprocessed
   data into an information system that can be shared among the targeted
   group of individuals. The secondary objectives are based on experiences
   of comparable types, and that knowledge is stored in a reusable
   repository for the benefit of any future need.},

Abstract = {In their struggle to offer a sustainable educational system and
   transversal competencies for market requests, significant
   transformations characterise the higher education system in Serbia and
   Romania. According to EU policy, these transformations are related to
   educational reforms and the introduction of new technology and
   methodologies in teaching and learning. They are expected to answer to
   the PISA requirements and to increase the DESI (Digital Economy and
   Society Index). They are also likely to mitigate the inequity of HEIs
   (higher education institutions), empowered by a structured,
   goal-oriented strategy towards agile management in HEIs that is also
   appropriate for new market demands. Our study is based on an exploratory
   survey applied to 139 Romanian and Serbian teachers from the Information
   Technology School-ITS, Belgrade, and Spiru Haret University, Romania.
   The survey let them provide their knowledge of AI or their perceptions
   of the difficulties and opportunities of these technologies in HEIs. Our
   study discovered how difficulties and opportunities associated with AI
   impact HEIs. This study aims to see how AI might assist higher education
   in Romania and Serbia. We also considered how they might be integrated
   with the educational system, and if instructors would utilise them.
   Developing creative and transversal skills is required to anticipate
   future breakthroughs and technological possibilitiesThe new methods of
   education focuses on ethics, values, problem-solving, and daily
   activities. Students' learning material, how they might achieve critical
   abilities, and their educational changes must be addressed in the
   future. In this environment, colleges must create new digital skills in
   IA, machine learning, IoT, 5G, the cloud, big data, blockchain, data
   analysis, using MS Office and other applications, MOOCs, simulation
   applications, VR/AR, and gamification. They must also develop
   cross-disciplinary skills and a long-term mindset.},

Abstract = {In the context of the information age, the development of artificial
   intelligence is flourishing, and it is becoming more and more closely
   integrated with economic life, which is an inevitable trend of future
   social development. Education is also inseparable from the support of
   science and technology. The penetration of artificial intelligence has
   changed traditional teaching models and methods. Under the influence of
   artificial intelligence technology, college education is developing more
   and more in the direction of informatization and intelligence. For
   college teachers, the study and application of artificial intelligence
   is an important and necessary means to achieve professional development.
   It is more important to train students to take independent self-study
   exams and focus on applying social skills, so that students can better
   adapt to the coming era of intelligence. Therefore, the purpose of this
   article is to explore the development of higher education and the
   improvement of teaching skills based on artificial intelligence and to
   analyze the problems and solutions in the process of higher education
   development. This article will use the research methods of specific
   problems and specific analysis to compare the data and draw conclusions.
   The research results show that in the information-based education
   innovation created by knowledge sharing, the teaching goals and methods
   are constantly changing. And about 85\% of the students believe that the
   development prospect of intelligent teaching is good, which verifies the
   feasibility of artificial intelligence technology in the development of
   college education. Only by training students' imagination, creativity,
   critical thinking, and autonomous learning can they adapt to today's
   rapidly developing society. Therefore, active learning and research on
   artificial intelligence is the embodiment of cultivating lifelong
   learning ability, improving rich teaching skills, constantly summing up
   experience, actively improving and trimming relevant change programs,
   and jointly promoting the rapid development of higher education under
   artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies (ETs) will most likely have a strong impact on
   education (starting with higher education), just like they have already
   had in so many economic and social areas. This paper is based on the
   results obtained in the project ``My Future Colleague Robot{''}, an
   initiative that aimed to improve the competence of university teaching
   staff regarding the introduction of ETs in teaching practices at
   university level. In this paper, we identified the strengths and
   weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that are related to the adoption
   in higher education of the combination of two ETs: robotics together
   with artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, we analyzed the
   perceptions of university-level teaching staff about the potential of
   introducing ETs in education. The empirical data presented here were
   collected using written essays from 18 university teachers and students.
   Deductive and inductive approaches with thematic analysis were used for
   the data analysis. The findings support the idea that previous
   ET-related experience can support positive attitudes and the
   implementations of ETs in university teaching; in this study, university
   teachers had optimistic expectations towards ETs, accepting them as part
   of teaching practice development, while discussion about the negative
   effects of ETs was negligible.},

Title = {Implementing Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: Pros and Cons
   from the Perspectives of Academics},
Journal = {SOCIETIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {This article investigates the perspectives of Romanian academics on
   implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE). The
   article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of
   eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and
   heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong
   supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the
   implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the
   advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for
   us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less
   well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a
   domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE
   is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies'
   leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will
   apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or
   in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this
   study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The
   positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of
   academics, to gains in the learning-teaching process, improvements in
   students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater
   efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects
   revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data
   security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are
   some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are
   less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to
   the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation
   of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in
   fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves,
   and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in
   the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results
   of this research is mainly empirical and practical. These opinions
   should be used as resources for managers of HE institutions to develop
   better policies concerning the implementation of AI in HE and for
   strategic vision toward AI, with the ultimate purpose of achieving
   progress and prosperity for the entire society.},

Title = {Is Artificial Intelligence Really the Next Big Thing in Learning and
   Teaching in Higher Education? A Conceptual Paper},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence in higher education (AIED) is becoming a more
   important research area with increasing developments and application of
   AI within the wider society. However, as yet AI based tools have not
   been widely adopted in higher education. As a result there is a lack of
   sound evidence available on the pedagogical impact of AI for learning
   and teaching. This conceptual paper thus seeks to bridge the gap and
   addresses the following question: is artificial intelligence really the
   new big thing that will revolutionise learning and teaching in higher
   education? Adopting the technological pedagogical content knowledge
   (TPACK) framework and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
   Technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical foundations, we argue that
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, at least in their current
   state of development, do not afford any real new advances for pedagogy
   in higher education. This is mainly because there does not seem to be
   valid evidence as to how the use of AI technologies and applications has
   helped students improve learning, and/or helped tutors make effective
   pedagogical changes. In addition, the pedagogical affordances of AI have
   not yet been clearly defined. The challenges that the higher education
   sector is currently experiencing relating to AI adoption are discussed
   at three hierarchical levels, namely national, institutional and
   personal levels. The paper ends with recommendations with regard to
   accelerating AI use in universities. This includes developing dedicated
   AI adoption strategies at the institutional level, updating the existing
   technology infrastructure and up-skilling academic tutors for AI.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics are likely to have a
   significant long-term impact on higher education (HE). The scope of this
   impact is hard to grasp partly because the literature is siloed, as well
   as the changing meaning of the concepts themselves. But developments are
   surrounded by controversies in terms of what is technically possible,
   what is practical to implement and what is desirable, pedagogically or
   for the good of society. Design fictions that vividly imagine future
   scenarios of AI or robotics in use offer a means both to explain and
   query the technological possibilities. The paper describes the use of a
   wide-ranging narrative literature review to develop eight such design
   fictions that capture the range of potential use of AI and robots in
   learning, administration and research. They prompt wider discussion by
   instantiating such issues as how they might enable teaching of high
   order skills or change staff roles, as well as exploring the impact on
   human agency and the nature of datafication.},

Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {22-42},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education has proven to be a
   useful learning technology; it can help learners achieve positive
   learning outcomes in the learning environment and can also enable
   teachers to better understand learners' learning status and further
   improve their teaching strategies. This study reviewed the top 50 AI in
   higher education studies in the Web of Science database from the
   perspective of highly cited papers and based on a technologybased
   learning model. The results show that predictions of learners' learning
   status (including dropout and retention, student models, and academic
   achievement) are most frequently discussed in the AI in higher education
   studies; AI technology is most commonly applied in engineering
   (including computer courses); AI technologies most often play the role
   of profiling and prediction in higher education, followed by intelligent
   tutoring systems and assessment and evaluation. In terms of research
   issues, the most frequently discussed issues are learning behaviour,
   accuracy, sensitivity and precision, cognition and affect. Learners'
   higher order thinking skills, collaboration or communication,
   self-efficacy or confidence and skills are less frequently discussed in
   AI in higher education studies. Accordingly, we propose potential
   research issues and practitioner notes for AI in higher education as a
   reference for researchers, educators and decision-makers.
   Implications for practice or policy:
   Higher education practitioners and researchers need to be aware of the
   latest developments in the research and practice of AI in higher
   education.
   Teachers need to understand the role they can play in teaching and
   learning practices through AI technology and how to use it to assist
   learners.
   It is important for administrators of educational institutions to
   understand the challenges teachers face in their teaching practices with
   AI technology and to develop measures to support them.},

Month = {DEC 28},
Abstract = {In order to solve the problems of low security and response efficiency
   and slow running speed of the current designed higher education system,
   a higher education system based on artificial intelligence technology is
   designed. Firstly, according to the characteristics of artificial
   intelligence technology, intelligent teaching system, agent technology,
   and data mining technology are introduced in detail. Then it analyzes
   the overall and detailed functional requirements of the system and
   adaptively generates knowledge content and teaching mode suitable for
   students' ability and personality by using intelligent reasoning ability
   and the collection and analysis of students' personality
   characteristics. Through data mining of intelligent teaching system, the
   decision tree about curriculum is obtained, and the students' cognitive
   ability is calculated. Based on the theory of cognitive science, using
   the ``double master{''} teaching mode, combined with agent technology
   and intelligent teaching system, the system function is divided into six
   modules. Through the design of database structure and data table, the
   design of higher education system based on artificial intelligence
   technology is realized. The experimental results show that the proposed
   method has high security and response efficiency, fast running speed,

Title = {Navigating the Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Higher
   Education: An Analysis of Seven Global AI Ethics Policies},

Abstract = {AI use in higher education raises ethical concerns that must be
   addressed. Biased algorithms pose a significant threat, especially if
   used in admission or grading processes, as they could have devastating
   effects on students. Another issue is the displacement of human
   educators by AI systems, and there are concerns about transparency and
   accountability as AI becomes more integrated into decision-making
   processes. This paper examined three AI objectives related higher
   education: biased algorithms, AI and decision-making, and human
   displacement. Discourse analysis of seven AI ethics policies was
   conducted, including those from UNESCO, China, the European Commission,
   Google, MIT, Sanford HAI, and Carnegie Mellon. The findings indicate
   that stakeholders must work together to address these challenges and
   ensure responsible AI deployment in higher education while maximizing
   its benefits. Fair use and protecting individuals, especially those with
   vulnerable characteristics, are crucial. Gender bias must be avoided in
   algorithm development, learning data sets, and AI decision-making. Data
   collection, labeling, and algorithm documentation must be of the highest
   quality to ensure traceability and openness. Universities must study the
   ethical, social, and policy implications of AI to ensure responsible
   development and deployment. The AI ethics policies stress responsible AI
   development and deployment, with a focus on transparency and
   accountability. Making AI systems more transparent and answerable may
   reduce the adverse effects of displacement. In conclusion, AI must be
   considered ethically in higher education, and stakeholders must ensure
   that AI is used responsibly, fairly, and in a way that maximizes its
   benefits while minimizing its risks.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence is an emerging technology that revolutionizes
   human lives. Despite the fact that this technology is used in higher
   education, many professors are unaware of it. In this current scenario,
   there is a huge need to arise, implement information bridge technology,
   and enhance communication in the classroom. Through this paper, the
   authors try to predict the future of higher education with the help of
   artificial intelligence. This research article throws light on the
   current education system the problems faced by the subject faculties,
   students, changing government rules, and regulations in the educational
   sector. Various arguments and challenges on the implementation of
   artificial intelligence are prevailing in the educational sector. In
   this concern, we have built a use case model by using a student
   assessment data of our students and then built a synthesized using
   generative adversarial network (GAN). The dataset analyzed, visualized,
   and fed to different machine learning algorithms such as logistic
   Regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbors
   (KNN), classification and regression trees (CART), naive Bayes (NB),
   support vector machines (SVM), and finally random forest (RF) algorithm
   and achieved a maximum accuracy of 58\%. This article aims to bridge the
   gap between human lecturers and the machine. We are also concerned about
   the psychological emotions of the faculty and the students when
   artificial intelligence takes control.},

Abstract = {Being one of the most commonly used and discussed communication
   technologies, artificial intelligence has been defined as both a machine
   intelligence that can be applied to business, presented by humanoid and
   non-humanoid robots, to promote and advance operational efficiency and a
   communication technology that can be used to communicate highly
   complicated applications and technological development via a machine
   displaying human mental functions like problem-solving, learning, and
   reasoning. The purpose of this study is to investigate how frequently
   artificial intelligence is employed in Turkey master's theses and Ph.D.
   dissertations, with a particular focus on how it is represented in the
   field of communication. The study is being developed in accordance with
   this goal by reviewing at postgraduate theses based on artificial
   intelligence that are permitted between 2019 and 2021 in the Council of
   Higher Education National Thesis Center. By using the content analysis
   method, quantitative data pertinent to the analyzed theses have been
   collected. The detailed and advanced search has conducted by being used
   artificial intelligence keyword. Of all examined theses regarding
   artificial intelligence in the Council of Higher Education National
   Thesis Center, the communication field's theses rate is only four
   percent. Furthermore, it is observed that thesis rate by years and
   interest to artificial intelligence has increased. Among departments of
   Social Science, the most theses written fields are communication,
   business, and economy. On the other hand, computer engineering is by far
   the most thesis written field including social, physical and health
   sciences. It is observed that in communication fields while Radio Cinema
   and Television and subsequently Public Relations fields are the most
   artificial intelligence based thesis, Journalism, Communication Design
   and Management and New Media fields are not found artificial
   intelligence based thesis.},

Abstract = {Sentiment Analysis (SA), a technique based on applying artificial
   intelligence to analyze textual data in natural language, can help to
   characterize interactions between students and teachers and improve
   learning through timely, personalized feedback, but its use in education
   is still scarce. This systematic literature review explores how SA has
   been applied for learning assessment in online and hybrid learning
   contexts in higher education. Findings from this review show that there
   is a growing field of research on SA, although most of the papers are
   written from a technical perspective and published in journals related
   to digital technologies. Even though there are solutions involving
   different SA techniques that can help predicting learning performance,
   enhancing feedback and giving teachers visual tools, its educational
   applications and usability are still limited. The analysis evidence that
   the inclusion of variables that can affect participants' different
   sentiment expression, such as gender or cultural context, remains
   understudied and should need to be considered in future developments.},

Abstract = {Online education has been facing difficulty in predicting the academic
   performance of students due to the lack of usage of learning process,
   summative data and a precise prediction of quantitative relations
   between variables and achievements. To address these two obstacles, this
   study develops an artificial intelligence-enabled prediction model for
   student academic performance based on students' learning process and
   summative data. The prediction criteria are first predefined to
   characterize and convert the learning data in an online engineering
   course. An evolutionary computation technique is then used to explore
   the best prediction model for the student academic performance. The
   model is validated using another online course that applies the same
   pedagogy and technology. Satisfactory agreements are obtained between
   the course outputs and model prediction results. The main findings
   indicate that the dominant variables in academic performance are the
   knowledge acquisition, the participation in class and the summative
   performance. The prerequisite knowledge tends not to play a key role in
   academic performance. Based on the results, pedagogical and analytical
   implications are provided. The proposed evolutionary computation-enabled
   prediction method is found to be a viable tool to evaluate the learning
   performance of students in online courses. Furthermore, the reported
   genetic programming model provides an acceptable prediction performance
   compared to other powerful artificial intelligence methods.},

Abstract = {The successes of using artificial intelligence (AI) in analysing
   large-scale data at a low cost make it an attractive tool for analysing
   student data to discover models that can inform decision makers in
   education. This article looks at the case of decision making from models
   of student satisfaction, using research on ten years (2008-17) of
   National Student Survey (NSS) results in UK higher education
   institutions. It reviews the issues involved in measuring student
   satisfaction, shows that useful patterns exist in the data and presents
   issues involved in the value within the data when they are examined
   without deeper understanding, contrasting the outputs of analysing the
   data manually, and with AI. The article discusses risks of using AI and
   shows why, when applied in areas of education that are not clear,
   understood and widely agreed, AI not only carries risks to a point that
   can eliminate cost savings but, irrespective of legal requirement, it
   cannot provide algorithmic accountability.},

Abstract = {The development of digital competence has become an important part of
   higher education, and digital competence assessments have attracted
   considerable attention and concerns. Previous studies in this area
   mainly focused on self-reporting and manual review methods such as
   questionnaires, which offer limited assessment value. To solve this
   issue, this study uses natural language processing (NLP)-a current
   promising artificial intelligence (AI) technology-to analyze syllabi for
   assessing digital competence in universities. Analysis results show that
   the proposed method can achieve an average accuracy and consistency of
   over 80\% with excellent efficiency. Moreover, the method demonstrates
   high consistency with manual evaluation results (kappa > 0.6) and
   enables automated large-scale objective assessment. In brief, the
   results suggest that the proposed method is efficient, effective, and
   reliable, making it a valuable solution for digital competence
   assessment. We accordingly explore the application expansion of this
   method in building the digital competence of universities. Furthermore,
   we discuss the theoretical, methodological, and applied contributions of

Title = {Learning to work with the black box: Pedagogy for a world with
   artificial intelligence},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 22},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into our
   society. University education needs to maintain its relevance in an
   AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to
   engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI
   according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a
   particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement
   about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be
   traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a `black box'.
   Rather than seeking to explain `black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy
   for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial
   and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships
   between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI
   as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts
   of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a)
   orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be
   called the tacit and explicit `rules of the game'; and (b) providing
   meaningful interactions with AI systems.},

   predictive modeling concepts relevant to cardiology such as feature
   selection and frequent pitfalls such as improper dichotomization.
   Second, it discusses common algorithms used in supervised learning and
   reviews selected applications in cardiology and related disciplines.
   Third, it describes the advent of deep learning and related methods
   collectively called unsupervised learning, provides contextual examples
   both in general medicine and in cardiovascular medicine, and then
   explains how these methods could be applied to enable precision

Abstract = {As a result of the instability of oil prices, the economic prospects of
   the Gulf region are increasing their focus on new technologies. Thus,
   Saudi Arabia has demonstrated a strong commitment towards the
   development and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   technologies as alternative sources for revenue and growth in line with
   globalisation, development, and the vision 2030. This paper examines the
   impact of AI in the Saudi Arabia community, especially for social and
   economic evolution. Special focus on the use of smart cars and smart
   cameras to monitor intelligently traffic, public services and national
   security is explored. A total of 424 participants from Eastern Province
   took part in this study. Analysis and discussion of the obtained results
   are also presented. The findings showed that 75.71\% of participants
   mostly highly agreed about the AI economic impact leading to an increase
   in both government and business financial incomes. Whereas only 59.84\%
   of participants mostly highly agreed about the social impact of AI as
   they are worried about AI ethical concerns, job loss and the changing

Abstract = {Over the past year, defined by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed
   a boom in applying key emerging technologies in education. In such
   challenging situations, technology and education expanded their work
   together to strengthen and interactively impact the learning process in
   the online higher education context. From a pedagogical perspective,
   extended reality (XR) and artificial intelligence (AI) were accessible
   toolboxes to amplify an active and learner-centered teaching method.
   Whether and how such activities will continue in a post-COVID-19
   situation remains unclear. In this systematic literature review, we
   document the application of XR and AI in online higher education
   settings and build up an accurate depiction of their influence after the
   COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. A significant contribution of the thorough
   analysis conducted was the corroboration of the growing interest of
   these fast-emerging technologies and their impact on learner agency and
   outcomes, making online education more accessible, effective, engaging,
   collaborative, self-paced, and adapted to the diverse academic
   trajectories. The momentum brought about by the pandemic has served as
   an impulse for educators and universities to expand the use of these
   technologies progressively, meet new challenges, and shape the future of
   online higher education.},

Abstract = {To improve the English proficiency of college students, this paper
   attempts to promote autonomous English learning among these students
   using artificial intelligence technology. Specifically, the principles,
   features and application fields of artificial intelligence were
   introduced in details, and the requirements, structure, database and
   processes of autonomous English learning systems were discussed at
   length. On this basis, the backpropagation (BP) neural network, a
   typical artificial intelligence technique, was selected to design the
   modules of the autonomous English learning system for college students.
   The proposed system was then implemented in integrated open environment
   of Visual Studio, the architecture of the browser/server system and the
   SQL Server database on the Windows platform. The results show that the
   proposed system provides college students with intelligent and open
   self-evaluation tests and effective learning feedbacks. The research
   findings shed new light on improving the English learning of college
   students and reliving the pressure on college English teachers.},

Abstract = {A major challenge in educational technology integration is to engage
   students with different affective characteristics. Also, how technology
   shapes attitude and learning behavior is still lacking. Findings from
   educational psychology and learning sciences have gained less traction
   in research. The present study was conducted to examine the efficacy of
   a group format of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered writing tool
   for English second postgraduate students in the English academic writing
   context. In the present study, (N = 120) students were randomly
   allocated to either the equipped AI (n = 60) or non-equipped AI (NEAI).
   The results of the parametric test of analyzing of covariance revealed
   that at post-intervention, students who participated in the AI
   intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvement in
   the scores, of the behavioral engagement (Cohen's d =.75, 95\% CI
   {[}0.38, 1.12]), of the emotional engagement Cohen's d =.82, 95\% CI
   {[}0.45, 1.25], of the cognitive engagement, Cohen's d =.39,95\% CI
   {[}0.04, .76], of the self-efficacy for writing, Cohen's d =.54, 95\% CI
   {[}0.18, 0.91], of the positive emotions Cohen's d =. 44, 95\% CI
   {[}0.08, 0.80], and of the negative emotions, Cohen's d = -.98, 95\% CI
   {[}-1.36, - 0.60], compared with NEAI. The results suggest that
   AI-powered writing tools could be an efficient tool to promote learning
   behavior and attitudinal technology acceptance through formative
   feedback and assessment for non-native postgraduate students in English
   academic writing.},

Abstract = {- AI is transforming many fields, including higher education. The
   pandemic has shown how AI can improve learning and teaching in higher
   education. This review examines how AI affects education quality,
   learning assessment, and higher education jobs (HE). The study employs a
   systematic qualitative method to review the academic literature on AI
   and higher education between 1900 and 2021. The data was gathered from
   various sources, including ERIC, Scopus, and the Web of Science, using
   specific exclusion and inclusion criteria centred on publication date,
   language, reported outcomes, setting, and publication type. From there
   on, the articles were analysed by Rayyan Software and categorised in
   Excel according to a scale that included aspects such as the quality of
   learning and teaching, assessment, and potential ethical future careers.
   The research also produced two bibliometric figures using VOSviewer to
   investigate co-authorship and the frequency of keyword occurrences in
   academic journals published in AI and HE. The analysis was done to
   ensure the study's validity in the scientific community. The study found
   that AI can improve education quality, provide practical learning and
   teaching methods, and improve assessments to better prepare students for
   careers. The study also emphasises the potential of AI to shape future
   employment opportunities and the need for higher education institutions
   to adopt AI to meet market demands. The study calls for more research on
   AI's effects on assessment, integrity, and higher education careers.},

Abstract = {The `growth' of academics in higher education is focused on quality
   improvements in teaching. However, the analysis has shown that the sense
   of academics significantly affects their practices that have been
   unaddressed due to inconsistent contextual conditions. This paper
   proposes a framework to study teachers' workplaces on the subjective
   factors that improve educational enhancement, supported by artificial
   intelligence (AI). Here, the administrative documents are analysed in
   the theory of history and culture framework, and it provides a technique
   for both traditional data analysis and modelling estimation of
   individual output in the feed-forward neural networks. A traditional
   statistical procedure is used to evaluate the variables that influence
   the success of students. Several differences in the teacher's
   socio-cultural context are identified based on the performance of the
   feed-forward neural network model, and it is measured by error rate
   reduction of 0.33, uncertainty matrix, the performance level of
   students. The feed-forward network model is the platform, and it is
   useful for predicting future academic achievement of students.
   Departmental teaching cultures and behavioural practices have affected
   both positive and negative behaviour in higher education teaching, which
   has been firmly addressed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Emergence of the use and application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
   higher education in India has opened new possibilities and challenges.
   Use of AI in will bring in effective change of governance in the entire
   internal architecture of Indian Institutes of higher education. The
   prospect of use of AI includes investigation of educational implications
   as to how teachers would enrich them, how students would learn, and how
   accurate and prompt decisions can be taken in the institutes of higher
   education. This is important since the workload has been multiplied due
   to massification of higher education. Such being the scenario, help of
   AI is highly essential. The question of adoption of AI in higher
   education is an important issue in this perspective. The purpose of this
   study is to explore how the stakeholders would be able to adopt it. For
   this, we have taken help of many adoption theories and models including
   `Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology' (UTAUT) model. We
   have developed hypotheses and a conceptual model and got it validated
   through survey with the help of feedbacks from useable 329 respondents.
   It has been found that the model can help the authorities to facilitate
   adoption of AI in higher education.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Academic integrity among radiographers and nuclear
   medicine technologists/scientists in both higher education and
   scientific writing has been challenged by advances in artificial
   intelligence (AI). The recent release of ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by
   GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to
   questions in real-time, has redefined the boundaries of academic and
   scientific writing. These boundaries require objective evaluation.
   Method: ChatGPT was tested against six subjects across the first three
   years of the medical radiation science undergraduate course for both
   exams (n = 6) and written assignment tasks (n = 3). ChatGPT submissions
   were marked against standardised rubrics and results compared to student
   cohorts. Submissions were also evaluated by Turnitin for similarity and
   AI scores.Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 performed below the
   average student performance in all written tasks with an increasing
   disparity as subjects advanced. ChatGPT performed better than the
   average student in foundation or general subject examinations where
   shallow responses meet learning outcomes. For discipline specific
   subjects, ChatGPT lacked the depth, breadth, and currency of insight to
   provide pass level answers.Conclusion: ChatGPT simultaneously poses a
   risk to academic integrity in writing and assessment while affording a
   tool for enhanced learning environments. These risks and benefits are
   likely to be restricted to learning outcomes of lower taxonomies. Both
   risks and benefits are likely to be constrained by higher order
   taxonomies. Implications for practice: ChatGPT powered by GPT3.5 has
   limited capacity to support student cheating, introduces errors and
   fabricated information, and is readily identified by software as AI
   generated. Lack of depth of insight and appropriateness for professional
   communication also limits capacity as a learning enhancement tool.},

Abstract = {As a cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd)
   that depends on advanced computing technologies, AI performance
   prediction model is widely used to identify at-risk students that tend
   to fail, establish student-centered learning pathways, and optimize
   instructional design and development. A majority of the existing AI
   prediction models focus on the development and optimization of the
   accuracy of AI algorithms rather than applying AI models to provide
   student with in-time and continuous feedback and improve the students'
   learning quality. To fill this gap, this research integrated an AI
   performance prediction model with learning analytics approaches with a
   goal to improve student learning effects in a collaborative learning
   context. Quasi-experimental research was conducted in an online
   engineering course to examine the differences of students' collaborative
   learning effect with and without the support of the integrated approach.
   Results showed that the integrated approach increased student
   engagement, improved collaborative learning performances, and strengthen
   student satisfactions about learning. This research made contributions
   to proposing an integrated approach of AI models and learning analytics
   (LA) feedback and providing paradigmatic implications for future
   development of AI-driven learning analytics.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having an impact on
   distance-based higher education, where it is revealing multiple ethical
   issues. However, to date, there has been limited research addressing the
   perspectives of key stakeholders about these developments. The study
   presented in this paper sought to address this gap by investigating the
   perspectives of three key groups of stakeholders in distance-based
   higher education: students, teachers, and institutions. Empirical data
   collected in two workshops and a survey helped identify what concerns
   these stakeholders had about the ethics of AI in distance-based higher
   education. A theoretical framework for the ethics of AI in education was
   used to analyse that data and helped identify what was missing. In this
   exploratory study, there was no attempt to prioritise issues as more, or
   less, important. Instead, the value of the study reported in this paper
   derives from (a) the breadth and detail of the issues that have been
   identified, and (b) their categorisation in a unifying framework.
   Together these provide a foundation for future research and may also
   usefully inform future institutional implementation and practice.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), especially the machine learning, is
   playing an increasingly important role in contemporary scientific
   research. Unlike the traditional computer program, machine learning can
   analyze a large number of data repeatedly and optimize its own model, a
   process which is called a ``learning process{''}. So that the AI can
   find the relationship underling the experiments from a large number of
   data, form a new model with better prediction and decisionmaking
   ability, and make an optimized strategy. The characteristics of chemical
   research just hit the strengths of machine learning. Chemical research
   often faces very complex material system and experimental process, so it
   is difficult to accurately analyze and making judgment through physical
   chemistry principles. Artificial intelligence can mine the correlation
   of massive experimental data generated in chemical experiments, help
   chemists make reasonable analysis and prediction, and therefore greatly
   accelerate the process of chemical research. This review presents the
   modern artificial intelligence method and its basic principles on
   solving chemical problems, by representative examples with specific
   machine learning algorithm. The application of artificial intelligence
   in chemical science is in a period of vigorous rise. Artificial
   intelligence has initially shown a powerful assist to chemical research.
   We hope this review can help more domestic chemical workers understand
   and use this powerful tool.},

Abstract = {The concept of artificial intelligence was first introduced in 1955 with
   the official proposal letter of the Dartmouth Summer Research Project
   prepared in Dartmouth College. With time and developments in artificial
   intelligence technology, the use of this concept has gained increasing
   popularity. Today, the effects of artificial intelligence, particularly
   on human rights, are being increasingly discussed in international
   meetings held between many states such as United Kingdom, France etc.
   The development of artificial intelligence technology and its
   integration in our lives has brought several conspiracy theories. Some
   people perceive it as a threat, whereas others see it as a useful
   technology for humanity. Artificial intelligence contributes to
   significant developments in several fields such as technology, health,
   and education. Similarly, it may contribute to the further improvement
   of human rights. However, its negative effects on human rights cannot be
   ignored. Identifying and eliminating such negative effects will also
   result in the prevention of human right violations. Considering the
   aforementioned reasons, it is essential to consider the positive and
   negative effects of artificial intelligence on human rights. In this
   study, first, the concept of artificial intelligence is detailed. Then,
   types of artificial intelligence based on their developments are
   discussed. Next, the artificial intelligence law is examined in the
   context of human rights and subsequently, the effects of artificial
   intelligence applications on human rights are detailed. Finally, the
   artificial intelligence applications are discussed in terms of some
   fundamental rights and freedoms. In this framework, the effects of
   artificial intelligence applications on the ``right to life,{''} ``right
   to a fair trial,{''} ``right to respect private and family life,{''}
   ``freedom of expression,{''} and ``principle of equality and prohibition
   of discrimination{''} are evaluated.},

Abstract = {Visual programming language is a crucial part of learning programming.
   On this basis, it is essential to use visual programming to lower the
   learning threshold for students to learn about artificial intelligence
   (AI) to meet current demands in higher education. Therefore, a 3-h AI
   course with an RGB-to-HSL learning task was implemented; the results of
   which were used to analyze university students from two different
   disciplines. Valid data were collected for 65 students (55 men, 10
   women) in the Science (Sci)-student group and 39 students (20 men, 19
   women) in the Humanities (Hum)-student group. Independent sample t-tests
   were conducted to analyze the difference between cognitive styles and
   computational thinking. No significant differences in either cognitive
   style or computational thinking ability were found after the AI course,
   indicating that taking visual AI courses lowers the learning threshold
   for students and makes it possible for them to take more difficult AI
   courses, which in turn effectively helping them acquire AI knowledge,

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution is opening up new opportunities and
   challenges for all industries, professions, and fields, aiming to bring
   humanity more optimal tools and services. During the Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, digital transformation has been one of the most critical
   problems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT)
   are two technologies that have the potential to cause the biggest
   breakout to evolve in the educational domain. In recent years, digital
   transformation has seen implementation across all sectors, including
   education, healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and other smart
   ecosystems. Among those areas, education, especially higher education,
   is among the most challenging due to the diversity in training programs,
   duration, and subjects. The Internet of Things makes it possible to
   create smart and ubiquitous learning environments, while artificial
   intelligence can completely transform the way we learn and teach. In
   this paper, we present the digital transformation process in higher
   education in Vietnam and internationally and analyze some
   characteristics of Vietnamese higher education in the digital
   transformation process. Moreover, we present the vision, approach, and
   challenges to digital transformation at universities of low- and
   middle-income countries from the perspective of the Hung Yen University
   of Technology and Education in Vietnam.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the practical prospects for using artificial
   intelligence technologies in professional English-speaking translator
   education. At the online conference `Translation Skills in Times of
   Artificial Intelligence' (DingTalk platform, January 2022), the teachers
   of higher education institutions in China prioritized the translator's
   competencies necessary for successful professional activity during the
   digital transformation of social and economic business relations. The
   educators also evaluated the demand for online services used in the
   education of English-Chinese interpreters. The survey results showed
   that the use of artificial intelligence technologies in educational
   practices could have a significant impact on the development of key
   competencies of future translators. Using a competency-based approach to
   interpreter training and considering the need to develop abilities,
   knowledge, and skills required for successful professional translation
   activity, the author developed the pedagogical concept of the online
   educational course `Simultaneous and asynchronous translation in a
   digital environment.'},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown, and technologies have
   intensified across all fields of life, particularly in education. AI has
   been applied to resources to improve skills giving teachers the time and
   freedom to provide understanding and adaptability and drive performance.
   This paper, written for policymakers in the field of education,
   highlights the impact of AI and advancements in academic policy. These
   academic policymakers generate ideas and strategies for applying AI
   across various disciplines. There is also discussion around AI
   implementation in education throughout developing nations for moving
   towards and ensuring affordable, high-quality education for every
   individual. Education for sustainable development (ESD) aims to promote
   the development of knowledge, skills, understanding, values and actions
   necessary to build a sustainable world, to protect and preserve the
   environment, and promote social equity and economic sustainability. This
   paper analyses how AI can be used to update learning probabilities by
   providing examples of how it can be integrated with existing educational
   systems, using data to improve educational capital and quality in
   developing countries. It goes on to discuss whether policymakers and
   institutions can reinvent and rework educational programs to polish
   graduates' skills for the growing presence of AI across all disciplines.
   There are four main parts to this work: (1) different dimensions
   regarding the complexities and potential implications, (2) the pros and
   cons of educational sustainability policy related to AI, (3) carving out
   AI and its outstanding execution, and finally (4) the linkage of AI with
   higher education within the context of educational expansions. In
   conclusion, the paper focuses on AI's applications, benefits and
   sustainable development education challenges.},

Abstract = {Reviewing the history of the development of artificial intelligence (AI)
   clearly reveals that brain science has resulted in breakthroughs in AI,
   such as deep learning. At present, although the developmental trend in
   AI and its applications has surpassed expectations, an insurmountable
   gap remains between AI and human intelligence. It is urgent to establish
   a bridge between brain science and AI research, including a link from
   brain science to AI, and a connection from knowing the brain to
   simulating the brain. The first steps toward this goal are to explore
   the secrets of brain science by studying new brain-imaging technology;
   to establish a dynamic connection diagram of the brain; and to integrate
   neuroscience experiments with theory, models, and statistics. Based on
   these steps, a new generation of AI theory and methods can be studied,
   and a subversive model and working mode from machine perception and
   learning to machine thinking and decision-making can be established.

   scenarios representing a 2 x 2 design (experimental and control
   cohorts). Data was garnered utilizing an academic achievement test and
   focus groups, which allowed more in depth analysis of the students'
   experience with the chatbot. The results of the study demonstrated that
   the students who interacted with the chatbot performed better
   academically comparing to those who interacted with the course
   instructor. Besides, the focus group data garnered from the experimental
   cohort illustrated that they were confident about the chatbot's
   integration into the course. The present study essentially focused on
   the learning of the experimental cohort and their view regarding
   interaction with the chatbot. This study contributes the emerging
   artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot literature to improve student
   academic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Ghana
   to integrate a chatbot to engage undergraduate students. This study
   provides critical information on the use and development of virtual
   teaching assistants using a zero-coding technique, which is the most
   suitable approach for organizations with limited financial and human
   resources.},

Abstract = {To evaluate the moral awareness of college students regarding artificial
   intelligence (AI) systems, we have examined 467 surveys collected from
   152 Japanese and 315 non-Japanese students in an international
   university in Japan. The students were asked to choose a most
   significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list
   of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show
   that most of the students (n = 269, 58\%) considered unemployment to be
   the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of
   students (n = 54, 12\%) was concerned with ethical issues related to
   emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion
   and robots' rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students
   referred to the risk of social control by AI (6\%), AI discrimination
   (6\%), increasing inequality (5\%), loss of privacy (4\%), AI mistakes
   (3\%), malicious AI (3\%), and AI security breaches (3\%). Calculation
   of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese
   students were much less concerned about AI control of society (- 3.1276,
   p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about
   discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were less concerned
   about unemployment (- 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more concerned
   about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05). The study concludes that the
   moral awareness of college students regarding AI technologies is quite
   limited and recommends including the ethics of AI in the curriculum.},

Abstract = {According to large-scale international studies, infertility affects
   about 186 million people around the world. The number of infertile
   couples increases every year. There are chances to solve this problem by
   implementing assisted reproductive technologies, mainly in vitro
   fertilization, into clinical practice. Despite high level of modern
   reproductive medicine development, only about a third of interventions
   succeed. Artificial Intelligence technologies are being integrated to
   make the stages of infertility diagnosis and treatment more accurate and
   effective. The most progressive directions of current studies are:
   improvement of quality of biomaterial assessment for IVF, prediction of
   IVF outcome based on patient data, as well as other methods. This review
   presents main applications of machine learning algorithms in
   reproductive medicine, steps involved in creating learning models, some
   of limitations as well as prospects for implementing these methods into
   clinical practice.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence based cognitive routing for cognitive radio
   networks},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-96},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are networks of nodes equipped with
   cognitive radios that can optimize performance by adapting to network
   conditions. Although various routing protocols incorporating varying
   degrees of adaptiveness and cognition have been proposed for CRNs, these
   works have mostly been limited by their system-level focus (that
   emphasizes optimization at the level of an individual cognitive radio
   system). The vision of CRNs as cognitive networks, however, requires
   that the research focus progresses from its current system-level
   fixation to the a network-wide optimization focus. This motivates the
   development of cognitive routing protocols envisioned as routing
   protocols that fully and seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based techniques into their design. In this paper, we provide a
   self-contained exposition of various decision-theoretic and learning
   techniques from the field of AI and machine-learning that are relevant
   to the problem of cognitive routing in CRNs. Apart from providing
   necessary background, we present for each technique discussed in this
   paper their application in the context of CRNs in general and for the
   routing problem in particular. We also highlight challenges associated
   with these techniques and common pitfalls. Finally, open research issues
   and future directions of work are identified.},

Abstract = {From the outset the incorporation of ICT and artificial intelligence
   (AI) in the education field generated a social debate that is still
   ongoing. One of the most controversial aspects was the introduction of
   intelligent tutoring and online learning systems. In 2016, the
   Artificial Intelligence and Life in 2030 report predicted that these
   systems would become the norm in classrooms in just fifteen years. Five
   years since the publication of that report, we need to know the current
   state of the art. One aim of this study is to investigate the
   relationship between the teacher-recommended use of ICT and artificial
   intelligence in the writing process and how this technology is actually
   used by students. Another aim is to determine what type of automated
   assessment and corrective feedback is applied by teachers and what
   perception both groups have about the use of ICT and AI. To conduct this
   study, we designed two ad hoc questionnaires, which were completed by 53
   professors and 101 students from the Polytechnic University of Valencia
   (UPV) and the University of Valencia (UV). One result from this research
   is that while 79\% of teachers recommend using ICT, only 61.4\% of
   students follow this recommendation. One conclusion we can draw is that
   ICT and AI have not yet been fully integrated into language teaching and
   learning. At the same time, most participants in this study admit that
   they do not take full advantage of this technology.},

Title = {Analysis on the Particularity of Higher Education Subject Development
   under the Background of Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Subject development plays a crucial role in higher education (HE),
   improving student academic performance. The HE continuously requires
   conceptual and empirical development to deliver valuable content to the
   students. The subject reforms offer quality, accessibility,
   affordability, accountability, and equity to accomplish continual
   learning. The changes in higher education subjects require a continuous
   assessment to understand the relationship between the reform and student
   performance. The subject development quality is evaluated using machine
   learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The existing
   researchers use intelligent techniques to identify student academic
   performance. However, the exact relationship between student performance
   and subject changes fails to address. Therefore, higher education
   learning (HEL) requires improvement to manage the Higher Education
   Subject Development (HESD). To achieve the research goal, AdaBoost
   Adaptive-Bidirectional Associative Memory (AA-BAM) network is introduced
   in this work. The network model uses the Hebbian supervised learning
   (HSL) process to create the training model. The learning process has a
   network parameter updating procedure that reduces the total error and
   deviation between the academic details. In addition, the neural model
   uses the memory cell that stores every processing information that
   recalls the output patterns with maximum accuracy. The output pattern
   identifies the student's academic performance, which helps to analyze
   the quality of the subject development in institutions. The created
   system ensures 98.78\% accuracy, showing that subject development
   correlates highly with student academic performance.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence for Assessment and Feedback to Enhance Student
   Success in Higher Education},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {The core focus of this review is to show how immediate and valid
   feedback, qualitative assessment influence enhances students learning in
   a higher education environment. With the rising trend of online
   education especially in this COVID-19 pandemic, the role of assessment
   and feedback also changes. Earlier the assessment part is not considered
   the main focus in learning and teaching in HEIs, but now with the
   increase in online education, it is observed that the paradigm is
   shifted toward assessing those activities of students that enhance their
   learning outcomes. A lot of research work has been done on developing
   assessment strategies and techniques that can support learning and
   teaching effectively. Yet, there is limited research that looks at how
   methods applied in learning analytics can be used and possibly
   constitutes the assessment process. The objective of this work is to
   provide an exploratory and comparative study of how assessment and
   feedback practices can enhance students learning outcomes using AI. The
   key contribution of this study attempts to capture an outline of the
   most used artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for
   student success. The results showed that I-FCN performed better than
   other techniques (ANN, XG Boost, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Trees)
   in all measured performance metrics. Also, the result of the comparative
   analysis study will help the educators, instructors, and administrators
   on how they could take the advantage of a data-driven approach, design
   less pressurized, more valid, reliable, constructive assessment
   findings, and connect the power of assessment and feedback to enhance
   the learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Background \& Aim: This study aims to examine the perception of
   artificial intelligence interviews experienced by prospective nursing
   graduates who have experienced artificial intelligence interviews at
   medical institutions using focus groups and provide necessary data to
   increase the efficiency of artificial intelligence interviews.
   Methods \& Materials: This study was conducted to examine nursing
   students' artificial intelligence interview experience during COVID-19
   by performing a focus group interview and qualitative content analysis.
   The focus group interview was carried out on November 17, 2021, to
   understand nursing students' artificial intelligence interview
   experience during COV1D-19, selecting a total of 14 senior nursing
   students.
   Results: As a result of analyzing the artificial intelligence interview
   experiences of nursing students who participated in this study, 35
   codes, grouped into eight subcategories, were derived. They are also
   classified into three categories 1) Finding your way in the dark, 2)
   Confronting artificial intelligence, and 3) Going beyond artificial
   intelligence. The eight subcategories derived are as follows: 1)
   Vagueness, 2) Find your way, 3) The fight between artificial
   intelligence and me, 4) Strong questions about interview evaluation, 5)
   New experience, 6) Learn your own tricks for artificial intelligence
   interviews, 7) Setting up the environment for artificial intelligence
   interview, 8) Establishment of information system for artificial
   intelligence interview.
   Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, an educational program
   should be developed based on the main data obtained from the artificial
   intelligence interview experience so that nursing college students can
   adapt to the artificial intelligence interview.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a disruptive technology that nowadays
   has countless applications in many day-to-day and professional domains.
   Higher education institutions need to adapt both to changes in their
   processes and to changes in curricula brought on by AI. Studying
   students' attitudes toward AI can be useful for analyzing what changes
   in AI teaching need to be implemented. This article uses an electronic
   survey to study the attitudes of Spanish students in the fields of
   economics and business management and education. A learning experience
   was also implemented with a small subset of students as a hands-on
   introduction to AI, where students were prompted to reflect on their
   experiences as users of AI. The results show that students are aware of
   AI's impact and are willing to further their education in AI, although
   their current knowledge is limited due to a lack of training. We believe
   that AI education should be expanded and improved, especially by
   presenting realistic use cases and the real limitations of the
   technology, so that students are able to use AI confidently and
   responsibly in their professional future.},

Title = {Implementing the Bashayer chatbot in Saudi higher education: measuring
   the influence on students' motivation and learning strategies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Since the fourth industrial revolution, intelligent software and
   applications that attempt to mimic human behavior have become
   increasingly common. The chatbot is an example of an artificial
   intelligence-based computer program that simulates human behavior by
   having a conversation and interacting with users using natural language.
   The implementation of chatbot technology in the educational context is
   still in its nascent stage, and further investigation into measuring its
   effectiveness in supporting learning and teaching processes is required,
   particularly in the context of higher education. Thus, this study
   presents the design and implementation of a task-oriented chatbot, that
   is embedded into the WhatsApp application, called Bashayer. It aims at
   supporting postgraduate students' motivation and learning strategies in
   Saudi Arabia. A quasi-experimental design with a single-subject
   experimental approach was adopted with a sample of 60 Saudi postgraduate
   students. The descriptive analysis of the collected data showed
   promising results of postgraduate students utilized the Bashayer chatbot
   system. Participants in the experimental group that used Bashayer were
   more motivated to learn than those in the control group. Participants
   also practiced more cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies
   while utilizing the chatbot compared to the control group. The results
   of this study are encouraging for the development of chatbot systems
   similar to Bashayer to support postgraduate students' successful
   learning. These results contribute to bridging the research gap and
   adding to the literature on chatbots use in postgraduate educational
   contexts.},

Month = {2023 MAY 16},
Abstract = {University teaching practices impact student interest, engagement, and
   academic performance. This paper presents a study that uses artificial
   intelligence (AI) to examine students' preferences for university
   teaching practices. We asked students in various fields open-ended
   questions about the best teaching practices they had experienced. Due to
   the large amount of data obtained, we used the AI-based language model
   Generative Pretrained Transformer-3 (GPT-3) to analyse the responses.
   With this model, we sorted students' testimonies into nine theory-based
   categories regarding teaching practices. After analysing the reliability
   of the classifications conducted by GPT-3, we found that the agreement
   between humans was similar to that observed between humans and the AI
   model, which supported its reliability. Regarding students' preferences
   for teaching practices, the results showed that students prefer
   practices that focus on (1) clarity and (2) interaction and
   relationships. These results enable the use of AI-based tools that
   facilitate the analysis of large amounts of information collected
   through open methods. At the didactic level, students' preferences and
   demand for clear teaching practices (in which ideas and activities are
   stated and shown without ambiguity) that are based on interaction and
   relationships (between teachers and students and among students
   themselves) are demonstrable.},

   Steps: An Overview of Solutions},
Journal = {VOPROSY OBRAZOVANIYA-EDUCATIONAL STUDIES MOSCOW},
Year = {2022},
Number = {4},
Pages = {107-153},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods are getting frequently used in research
   and devel-opment in learning analytics, which is aimed at analyzing data
   collected during learning to enhance its results. The same aim is
   relevant for instructional designmodels, the most widely applied is
   ADDIE model, which cuts course design into steps. The first two research
   fields are criticized for a weak connection to teaching practice, while
   the third lacks evidence-based and measurable nature. This literature
   review aims to show the prospects of bringing the three fields together.
   The theoretical analysis of the paper covers AI definition, its
   techniques and methods, areas of application in educational setting, the
   definition of learning analytics, its borders with other fields, spheres
   of application, definition and the essence of in-structional design, as
   well as the concept of ADDIE model which frames the practical analysis
   of the review. Forty-three articles were included in the final sample.
   The solutions described there correlate with the tasks of the
   instructional design steps and are systematized according to them. It
   was found that the least number of solutions described in the literature
   were assigned to the analysis, design and evaluation steps, more
   articles were assigned to the development step, and the largest number
   of papers considered the application step. It can be due to the
   difference in the availability of data at different ADDIE steps. The
   weak focus of teachers on methodological reflection at the assessment
   step also may play a role. These deficiencies open up the opportunities
   for future research and developments. To push these solutions forward it
   is crucial to elaborate on the models, to move from anecdotal
   experiments to a wide-scale practice, and to enhance required
   competencies among the faculty. The questions and conclusions presented
   in the article help to set a new pedagogically-oriented framework for
   discus-sions of AI and learning data analytics.},

Abstract = {We are currently witnessing a global increase in the provision of
   software platforms and services, offered at << no cost >> by large
   corporations, to higher education. The business model behind these
   services is largely based on the collection and analysis of massive
   quantities of user data and metadata, collected through educational
   packages, which include e-mail, video-conferencing, groupware, file
   sharing, and other integrated services. The penetration of these
   services in higher education worldwide is largely unknown. In this study
   we discuss a methodology and a software script developed to collected
   new data for all 448 public higher education institutions in all 13
   countries in South America. The data show that for every ten higher
   education institutions in the region, eight have services and platforms
   offered by such businesses. We contend that the adoption of these
   services is largely due to disinvestment in public education, and
   threaten the operational autonomy of institutions in regards to research
   and teaching, while leading to concerns in regards to data control,
   privacy, and transparency for teachers, administrators and students.},

Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is becoming
   increasingly prevalent, and its encroachment and impact on online
   education and assessment is a topic of interest to researchers and
   lecturers. ChatGPT is one such AI model that has been trained on a large
   corpus of text data to generate human-like responses to questions and
   prompts. Using the theory of disruptive innovation as a foundation for
   our argument, this conceptual article explores the potential and
   possible disruption of ChatGPT in online assessment. This article also
   considers the ethical and pedagogical implications of using ChatGPT,
   particularly in relation to online assessment in distance education.
   While the use of AI in online assessment presents a myriad of
   limitations and possibilities, it is crucial to approach its use with
   caution and consider the ethical implications of academic integrity for
   online assessment. This article aims to contribute to the ongoing
   discussion and debate around the use of AI in online higher education
   and assessment, highlighting the need for continued research and
   critical evaluation of its impact.},

Abstract = {Students of Software Engineering Capstone Courses face situations and
   challenges that grant them valuable experiences. However, as this
   knowledge is acquired through real-life exposure, it is difficult to
   transmit it across different generations. To deal with this problem, it
   has been proposed that students record their learnings through a lesson
   learned model. But the question of how future students can best benefit
   from these records remains unanswered. This study addresses this problem
   through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Virtual Assistant
   combined with a recommender system. Artificial Intelligence Virtual
   Assistants, as conversational chatbots, are a manifestation of AI via
   the simulation of conversation with human users. The technology has the
   potential to provide personalized service to a range of stakeholders.
   Thus, we seek to move this trend forward by now pushing these
   capabilities into the field of higher education. Consequently, we aim to
   assist software engineering students by leveraging collective knowledge
   to enhance learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for helping students attain
   high academic performance and achieve their learning objectives in the
   online learning context. However, learners often face challenges in
   properly applying SRL in online learning environments. Recent
   developments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications have shown
   promise in supporting learners' self-regulation in online learning by
   measuring and augmenting SRL, but research in this area is still in its
   early stages. The purpose of this study is to explore students'
   perceptions of the use of AI applications to support SRL and to identify
   the pedagogical and psychological aspects that they perceive as
   necessary for effective utilization of those AI applications. To explore
   this, a speed dating method using storyboards was employed as an
   exploratory design method. The study involved the development of 10 AI
   application storyboards to identify the phases and areas of SRL, and
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 university students
   from various majors. The results indicated that learners perceived AI
   applications as useful for supporting metacognitive, cognitive, and
   behavioral regulation across different SRL areas, but not for regulating
   motivation. Next, regarding the use of AI applications to support SRL,
   learners requested consideration of three pedagogical and psychological
   aspects: learner identity, learner activeness, and learner position. The
   findings of this study offer practical implications for the design of AI
   applications in online learning, with the aim of supporting students'
   SRL.},

Abstract = {Purpose The world of work and education is changing at a rapid pace,
   driven by continued technological disruption and automation. The future
   is uncertain and difficult to envisage. A futures thinking scenario
   planning approach is used in exploring and guiding education policy
   makers on how best to respond to the range of possible futures. The
   paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This study
   utilizes elements of prior scenario planning methodologies to devise a
   practical model of preferred and plausible likely scenarios in the
   context of rapid and continuing technology disruption. Based on the
   notion of ``impact and uncertainty,{''} two possible future alternatives
   of work and learning were developed. Incorporating elements of the
   possibility space scenario framework and a vignette approach of current
   emergent technologies, this paper assessed the usefulness of the
   preferred and likely outcomes. Findings While preferred future scenarios
   entailing collaborative styles such as human-machine cooperation, smart
   virtual active learning campuses and living knowledge learning
   environments may produce more desirable benefits for education
   stakeholders, the more likely plausible scenario is one based on
   continued disruptive technologies. Automation, artificial intelligence
   and the advent of 5G network technologies will drive customization and
   personalization in higher education delivery and revolutionize the work
   landscape in the immediate future. Universities will need to embrace and
   respond to these changes. Originality/value The paper gives insights
   into how universities can prepare their students for future of work and
   improve their employability. In addition, this author recommends ways in
   which HEIs can leverage these newer technologies to drive educational
   services and commercial value.},

   empirical study considering artificial intelligence usefulness,

Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 7},
Abstract = {The new era of technologies represented by artificial intelligence is
   profoundly reconstructing the field of education. The integration of
   emerging technologies in intelligent teaching provides new approaches
   for improving teaching effectiveness and enriching learning experiences.
   Today, we know little about students' participation in intelligent
   teaching with the help of artificial intelligence. In this study, we
   investigated the mechanism of students' involvement in intelligent
   teaching. We designed a questionnaire for the confirmatory model of the
   participation of intelligent teaching through literature research and
   content analysis. After modeling and empirical analysis with the help of
   partial least structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) software (SmartPLS
   3.0), we found that: satisfaction, university support, perceived
   enjoyment, and interactive rewards all indirectly affect intelligent
   teaching participation through mediating variables (i.e., participation
   intention and interactivity); participation intention and interactivity
   directly and positively affect intelligent teaching participation;
   artificial intelligence usefulness positively moderates the
   relationships between the two mediating variables (participation
   intention, interactivity) and intelligent teaching participation. Based
   on the results of the data analysis, this study offered corresponding
   optimization strategies: improving students' participation experience in
   intelligent teaching through using the new technology ``artificial
   intelligence{''}; implementing the teaching philosophy of ``teaching for
   learning, teaching for fun{''}; applying ``student-oriented{''}
   approaches to improve the participation intention. The aim is to make
   education in the future more diverse, equitable, and high-quality.},

   and summed up the problems with these applications. Next, the promotive
   role of AI in art teaching was analyzed in detail, and three strategies
   were developed to promote AI applications in modern art teaching,
   namely: expand the adaptability of AI-based art teaching; improve the
   intelligent teaching mode of art teaching; and enhance the artistic
   experience and atmosphere of AI-based art teaching. At the same time, to
   evaluate the application effect of AI in art teaching, a performance
   analysis model was designed based on analytical hierarchy process (AHP)
   and grey clustering. The proposed model can quantify the application
   effect of AI in art teaching, and it has a good application potential.},

Title = {The impact of ChatGPT on higher education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Introduction This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI's ChatGPT, on Higher
   Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI,
   understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes
   paramount.Methods Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and
   Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI
   chatbots' impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed
   articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding
   tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused
   on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined
   descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and
   applications of AI chatbots in HEIs.Results The literature review
   revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT's potential in education.
   Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and
   enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online
   testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts
   like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety
   were identified. The study also underscored the transformative
   architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the
   educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined
   enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research
   aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks
   such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human
   interaction, and accessibility issues were identified.Discussion While
   AI's global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for
   balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are
   encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to
   mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study's
   limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI's overall
   effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines,
   it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant
   benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible
   integration of such technologies within HEIs.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence for Student Assessment: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Featured Application The work provides insight into how AI is being
   applied to student assessment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being
   implemented in more and more fields, including education. The main uses
   of AI in education are related to tutoring and assessment. This paper
   analyzes the use of AI for student assessment based on a systematic
   review. For this purpose, a search was carried out in two databases:
   Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 454 papers were found and, after
   analyzing them according to the PRISMA Statement, a total of 22 papers
   were selected. It is clear from the studies analyzed that, in most of
   them, the pedagogy underlying the educational action is not reflected.
   Similarly, formative evaluation seems to be the main use of AI. Another
   of the main functionalities of AI in assessment is for the automatic
   grading of students. Several studies analyze the differences between the
   use of AI and its non-use. We discuss the results and conclude the need
   for teacher training and further research to understand the
   possibilities of AI in educational assessment, mainly in other
   educational levels than higher education. Moreover, it is necessary to
   increase the wealth of research which focuses on educational aspects
   more than technical development around AI.},

Title = {Factors Affecting the Adoption of AI-Based Applications in Higher
   Education: An Analysis of Teachers' Perspectives Using Structural
   Equation Modeling},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Owing to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
   technologies, there has been increasing concern about how to promote the
   use of AI technologies in school settings to enhance students' learning
   performance. Teachers' intention to adopt AI tools in their classes
   plays a crucial role in this regard. Therefore, it is important to
   explore factors affecting teachers' intention to incorporate AI
   technologies or applications into course designs in higher education. In
   this study, a structural equation modeling approach was employed to
   investigate teachers' continuance intention to teach with AI. In the
   proposed model, 10 hypotheses regarding anxiety (AN), self-efficacy
   (SE), attitude towards Al (ATU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and
   perceived usefulness (PU) were tested, and this study explored how these
   factors worked together to influence teachers' continuance intention. A
   total of 311 teachers in higher education participated in the study.
   Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the five
   endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 70.4\% of the
   changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of
   BI. The total effect of ATU was 0.793, followed by SE, with a total
   effect of 0.554. As a result, the intentions of teachers to learn to use
   AI-based applications in their teaching can be predicted by ATU, SE,
   PEU, PU and AN. Among them, teachers' SE positively influenced teachers'
   PEU and ATU towards adopting AI-based applications, and also influenced
   PU through PEU. In addition, the relationship between teachers' SE and
   AN was negatively correlated, which indicated that enhancing teachers'
   SE could reduce their AN towards using AI-based applications in their
   teaching. Accordingly, implications and suggestions for researchers and
   school teachers are provided.},

Abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things, smart logistics has become an
   important means to improve people's life rhythm and quality of life. At
   present, some problems in logistics engineering have caused logistics
   efficiency to fail to meet people's expected goals. Based on this, this
   paper proposes a logistics engineering optimization system based on
   machine learning and artificial intelligence technology. Moreover, based
   on the classifier chain and the combined classifier chain, this paper
   proposes an improved multi-label chain learning method for
   high-dimensional data. In addition, this study combines the actual needs
   of logistics transportation and the constraints of the logistics
   transportation process to use multi-objective optimization to optimize
   logistics engineering and output the optimal solution through an
   artificial intelligence model. In order to verify the effectiveness of
   the model, the performance of the method proposed in this paper is
   verified by designing a control experiment. The research results show
   that the logistics engineering optimization based on machine learning
   and artificial intelligence technology proposed in this paper has a
   certain practical effect.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence is an emerging sector in almost all fields. It
   is not confined only to a particular category and can be used in various
   fields like research, technology, and health. AI mainly concentrates on
   how computers analyze data and mimic the human thought process. As drug
   development involves high R \& D costs and uncertainty in time
   consumption, artificial intelligence can serve as one of the promising
   solutions to overcome all these demerits. Due to the availability of
   enormous data, there are chances of missing out on some crucial details.
   To solve these issues, algorithms like machine learning, deep learning,
   and other expert systems are being used. On successful implementation of
   AI in the pharmaceutical field, the delays in drug development, failure
   at the clinical and marketing level can be reduced. This review
   comprises information regarding the development of AI, its subfields,
   its overall implementation, and its application in the pharmaceutical

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and
   learning due to its quick progress. Any creation made with the help of
   artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works
   generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration
   with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of
   environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and
   innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into
   effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several
   challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art
   design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the
   absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index
   system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and
   teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to
   AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and
   improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The
   widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education
   has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software
   that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to
   learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for
   explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should
   confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the
   original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually
   enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and
   constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT
   investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in
   higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence.
   The experimental results show that the proposed method develops smart
   teaching (98.1\%), flexibility (96.5\%), performance (93.6\%),
   participation (94.9\%), and interaction (95.1\%).},

Abstract = {Teaching artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging challenge in global
   school education. There are considerable barriers to overcome, including
   the existing practices of technology education and teachers' knowledge
   of AI. Research evidence shows that studying teachers' experiences can
   be beneficial in informing how appropriate design in teaching
   sustainable AI should evolve. Design frames characterize teachers'
   design reasoning and can substantially influence their AI lesson design
   considerations. This study examined 18 experienced teachers' perceptions
   of teaching AI and identified effective designs to support AI
   instruction. Data collection methods involved semi-structured
   interviews, action study, classroom observation, and post-lesson
   discussions with the purpose of analyzing the teachers' perceptions of
   teaching AI. Grounded theory was employed to detail how teachers
   understand the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI and the emerging
   pedagogical solutions from their perspectives. Results reveal that
   effective AI instructional design should encompass five important
   components: (1) obstacles to and facilitators of participation in
   teaching AI, (2) interactive design thinking processes, (3) teachers'
   knowledge of teaching AI, (4) orienteering AI knowledge for social good,
   and (5) the holistic understanding of teaching AI. The implications for
   future teacher AI professional development activities are proposed.},

Abstract = {The effect of the latest novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) on higher
   education, specifically the transition from face-to-face sessions to
   online and interactive learning systems, is investigated in this study.
   The paper discusses the difficulties that higher education institutions
   face in transitioning to `online pedagogy,' including mobility issues,
   technology connectivity, digital learning, and differential access to
   education. The key obstacles of a shift to distance teaming during
   COVID-19, according to the findings, are technical resources and
   differential access to education. Though COVID-19 was challenging for
   students, it also served as a springboard for realistic alternatives
   such as artificial intelligence (AI), public-private educational
   collaborations, and digitalization. Universities should study policies
   to mitigate the detrimental effects of COVID-19, according to the
   findings, while maintaining a dedication to creativity and large-scale
   changes in practice.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence-based tools are rapidly revolutionizing the
   field of higher education, yet to be explored in terms of their impact
   on existing higher education institutions' (HEIs) practices adopted for
   continuous learning improvement, given the sparsity of the literature
   and empirical experiments in undergraduate degree programs. After the
   entry of ChatGPT -a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tool
   that uses a deep learning model to generate human-like text response
   based on provided input-it has become crucial for HEIs to be exposed to
   the implications of AI-based tools on students' learning outcomes,
   commonly measured using an assessment-based approach to improve program
   quality, teaching effectiveness, and other learning support. An
   empirical study has been conducted to test the ChatGPT capability of
   solving a variety of assignments (from different level courses of
   undergraduate degree programs) to compare its performance with the
   highest scored student(s). Further, the ChatGPT-generated assignments
   were tested using the best-known tools for plagiarism detection to
   determine whether they could pass the academic integrity tests,
   including Turnitin, GPTZero, and Copyleaks. The study reported the
   limitations of the Bot and highlighted the implications of the newly
   launched AI-based ChatGPT in academia, which calls for HEIs' managers
   and regulators to revisit their existing practices used to monitor
   students' learning progress and improve their educational programs.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {With the continuous breakthrough and innovation of artificial
   intelligence technology, the demand for diversified and multi-level
   compound intelligent manufacturing talents keeps growing. However, the
   current pace of intelligent manufacturing talent education in colleges
   and universities is still difficult to keep up with the advances in
   science and technology in the context of the new generation of
   artificial intelligence. This work conducted visual research of the
   literature on artificial intelligence in the field of manufacturing. All
   the literature was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and
   divided into three periods (1979-1994, 1995-2007 and 2008-2021)
   according to the fluctuation of literature volume. Bibliometric and
   content analysis of the related literature during these periods were
   conducted to track the hotspots and trend of artificial intelligence in
   the field of manufacturing. The results showed that the internet of
   things, deep learning, cyber physical systems and smart manufacturing
   have been the new research hotspots. Finally, a series of suggestions
   were given for the sustainable education of intelligent manufacturing
   talents in the context of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
   This work may provide references for the construction of sustainable
   education systems for intelligent manufacturing talents in the context
   of the new generation of artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {Writing academic arguments is a complex and demanding task, even for
   proficient tertiary students. At the same time, providing prompt support
   for individual students working on discipline-specific arguments is
   often challenging for instructors. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   techniques enable automated and adaptive educational scaffolding. In
   this study, we leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI techniques
   in an AI-Supported Scaffolding (AISS) system to evaluate written
   arguments and present alternative writing examples that human experts
   might write. To evaluate a pilot version of AISS, we gathered
   mixed-method data from 14 students enrolled in two sections of the same
   graduate-level online course (6 students in Cohort 1 and 8 students in
   Cohort 2). We used the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Cohesion
   (TAACO) to track revisions in written arguments. TAACO indices
   demonstrated that the students used AI-generated scaffolding to build
   stronger claims with more elaborate and cohesive ideas. In written
   reflections, students revealed the perceived value of AISS, and visual
   inspection of their writing indicates that students used AISS feedback
   to improve their arguments. The findings demonstrate the potential of AI
   to provide personalised scaffolding for academic argument composition.},

Pages = {1-21},
Abstract = {ChatGPT, an interactive, generative artificial intelligence (AI) system,
   was introduced in late 2022, quickly becoming one of the most rapidly
   adopted technologies in history. The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and
   similar AI tools, such as Google's Bard, and GPT-enabled Bing from
   Microsoft have led to intense discussions about how they will affect
   various aspects of society, including higher education. Information
   systems (IS) education will not escape the impact of AI tools. Our goal
   for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of
   possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS
   educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we
   discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools,
   and discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such
   tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI
   serving as competition for IS educators. We examine the challenges and
   consequences of each scenario. We also discuss potential responses,
   ranging from doing nothing to embracing AI tools as legitimate learning
   aids. We then provide several specific recommendations that will allow
   IS educators to effectively respond to the rise of AI tools.},

Abstract = {Machine learning and digitization have been around for several years,
   but their use has become a necessity with the Covid-19 pandemic.
   Lockdown forced us to work remotely overnight, to use digital networks
   to communicate, make payments, learn all sectors of activity were forced
   to adapt to the digital age in one night. Digitization and involvement
   of machine learning become a necessity with the Covid-19 pandemic. This
   paper shows how artificial intelligence can be used to improve the
   effectiveness of teaching, research, and study plan, by adapting the new
   communication technologies and students' needs to achieve the course
   learning outcomes in a virtual environment. The paper proposes three
   ways of using artificial intelligence in higher education, namely
   physical robot at the entrance of the campus to guide the visitors,
   robotic process automation to assist admission and registration process,
   and robotic process automation to aid professors in student's evaluation
   process and improve the academic study plan.},

Abstract = {The fundamental solution to the problems of college students' employment
   is to encourage college students to start their own businesses. Only by
   using entrepreneurship to promote employment can the real solution of
   China's higher education employment problems be truly solved Aiming at
   the current situation of college students' entrepreneurship and
   employment, this paper builds a model system suitable for college
   students' employment and entrepreneurship forecast and guidance through
   artificial intelligence algorithms and fuzzy logic models. The
   diversity-enhanced employment recommendation system developed in this
   paper uses the MVC three-tier architecture. Moreover, the
   diversity-enhanced employment recommendation system designed in this
   paper provides two recommendation methods: individual diversity
   optimization and overall diversity optimization, which takes into
   account the relationship between students' personal interests and
   employment work. In addition, the system uses the basic idea of
   user-based collaborative filtering. Finally, this paper designs a
   control experiment to analyze the performance of this research model.
   The research shows that the entrepreneurship employment forecast and
   guidance model constructed in this paper has a certain effect.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported access system is the computer
   interacted communication system. According to the accessible and dynamic
   data management schemes have been introduced in education. However, some
   specific limitations have been noted in existing systems, such as the
   data collected might not be sufficient for access and retrieval
   purposes. It remains challenging in organizational and institutional
   data management. In this research, A Dynamic Student Data Management
   System using AI Computer Vision Techniques (DSDM-AICV) for the Higher
   education institution data access and retrieval process is introduced. A
   process flow regarding data is generated based on the collected
   information with an AI-enabled archive and dynamic user access. The flow
   of dynamic data helps to explore the relations between student data and
   data management improvement. The proposed method showed its
   effectiveness in the education system and compared it with the available
   schemes, and the execution result shows extensive efficiency. The
   numerical results show that the proposed method enhances the data
   accessibility ratio of 96.8\%, decision-making ratio of 97.3\%,

Abstract = {With the continuous development of science and technology, artificial
   intelligence technology, deep learning technology, and signal
   transmission technology have all been rapidly developed. The products of
   artificial intelligence can be used in all kinds of people's lives and
   studies, making people's lives and learning is more convenient. Some
   universities should also change their own teaching management methods,
   improve the quality of teaching, catch up with the trend of artificial
   intelligence development, improve the competitiveness of schools, and
   cultivate more talents for the society. Edge computing technology is a
   component of cloud computing. It can calculate data stored in cloud
   computing and has good storage capabilities. Users can calculate and
   store large quantities of data through edge computing technology. At
   present, the role of edge computing technology is becoming more and more
   important. In this research, we first gave a brief introduction to 5G
   technology, explained the role and status of 5G technology, and then
   conducted an in-depth analysis from the perspective of edge computing,
   and compared edge technology with other technologies. Deepen the
   understanding of edge computing technology. We also discussed the
   management of many universities in combination with 5G technology. The
   system we designed has three-tier architecture, including three
   functional modules, and each functional module is divided into multiple
   sub-modules. Finally, we made plans and suggestions for the development

   higher education, especially in connection with scientific-technological
   studies. In this study, we concentrate on how AI techniques can support
   the teaching-learning process in engineering and we describe how AI can

   Data was analysed using SPSS 23.Results: Of the 390 participants,
   168(43.1\%) were males and 222(56.9\%) were females. The overall mean
   age was 20 +/- 1.65 years. There were 121(31\%) students from the first
   year of studies, 122(31.3\%) second year, 30(7.7\%) from third year,
   73(18.7\%) from fourth year, and 44(11.3\%) from the fifth year. Most
   participants 221(56.7\%) had a good familiarity with artificial
   intelligence, and 226(57.9\%) agreed that the biggest advantage of using
   artificial intelligence in healthcare was its ability to speed up the
   processes. In terms of gender of year of studies, there were no
   significant differences on both counts (p>0.05).Conclusion: Medical
   students, regardless of age and year of studies, were found to have a
   good understanding of the usage and application of artificial

Abstract = {The shortage of qualified teachers, weak basic knowledge foundation of
   students, and insufficient awareness of autonomous learning of students
   are the reasons why the sports level of college students is generally
   low at this stage. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology, as a
   discipline to study the laws of human intelligent activities, its
   application in college physical education combining with Internet can
   effectively alleviate the problems of insufficient qualified teachers
   and single teaching mode. This paper first briefly introduces the
   principle, characteristics and application fields of Al. Then it
   analyzes the system requirements, overall structure, database
   requirements and system flow one by one, and uses the BP neural network
   in the field of Al to carry out the design of student autonomous
   learning. Finally, the AI-based college student sports autonomous
   learning system is realized in the Visual Studio integrated open
   environment, the browser/server system architecture, and the SQL Server
   database under the Windows platform. The intelligence and autonomy of
   the learning system provide intelligent, open self-evaluation test and
   effective learning feedback for college students' learning, which is of
   great significance to help college students improve their sports level
   and ease the teaching pressure of teachers.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The concept of addiction in relation to cellphone and
   smartphone use is not new, with several researchers already having
   explored this phenomenon. Artificial intelligence has become important
   in the rapid development of the technology field in recent years. It has
   a very positive impact on our day-to-day life. Aim: To investigate the
   relationship between nursing students' addiction to smart devices and
   their perceptions of artificial intelligence. Methods: A cross-sectional
   design was applied. The data were collected from 697 nursing students
   over three months at the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah bint
   Abdulrahman University. Results: The correlation test shows a
   significant correlation between smart device addiction and the
   artificial intelligence of the respondents (p-value < 0.05). In
   addition, the majority of the students, 72.7\% (507), are moderately
   addicted to smartphones, 21.8\% (152) are highly addicted, and only
   5.5\% (38) have a low addiction. Meanwhile, 83.6\% (583) of them have
   high levels of perception of artificial intelligence and the rest,
   16.4\% (114), have a moderate level. Conclusions: The nursing students'
   perception of artificial intelligence varies significantly according to
   their level of addiction to smart device utilization.},

Title = {Multiple Explainable Approaches to Predict the Risk of Stroke Using
   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Stroke occurs when a brain's blood artery ruptures or the brain's blood
   supply is interrupted. Due to rupture or obstruction, the brain's
   tissues cannot receive enough blood and oxygen. Stroke is a common cause
   of mortality among older people. Hence, loss of life and severe brain
   damage can be avoided if stroke is recognized and diagnosed early.
   Healthcare professionals can discover solutions more quickly and
   accurately using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
   As a result, we have shown how to predict stroke in patients using
   heterogeneous classifiers and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).
   The multistack of ML models surpassed all other classifiers, with
   accuracy, recall, and precision of 96\%, 96\%, and 96\%, respectively.
   Explainable artificial intelligence is a collection of frameworks and
   tools that aid in understanding and interpreting predictions provided by
   machine learning algorithms. Five diverse XAI methods, such as Shapley
   Additive Values (SHAP), ELI5, QLattice, Local Interpretable
   Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Anchor, have been used to
   decipher the model predictions. This research aims to enable healthcare
   professionals to provide patients with more personalized and efficient
   care, while also providing a screening architecture with automated tools
   that can be used to revolutionize stroke prevention and treatment.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Smart Educational Learning (SEL) has recently opened its ways in various
   changes in scientific discoveries, informatics, globalization,
   astronautics production, robotics, and artificial intelligence in the
   Higher Education System. In such an educational system, managing
   resources to increase education quality with an effective interactive
   environment has been considered a significant challenging factor for the
   Students and Teachers. Hence, in this paper, the internet of things
   assisted Interactive system (IoT-IS) for Smart Learning is used to
   measure the teachers' and students' performance analysis in the SEL
   platform. The psychometric processes with standards for effective
   teaching using smart educational learning tools have been discussed
   based on the higher education system requirements. Furthermore, an
   active learning strategy with an attention scoring method promotes
   students' performance assessment in the higher education system using
   the interactive system. Facial expression detection and analysis are
   used and applied in online classroom videos in the SEL. Based on this
   detection and analysis, the attention of the students is observed. The
   experimental results show that the method enhances the student
   performance ratio of 98.5\%, an accuracy ratio of 95.3\%, an efficiency
   ratio of 96.7\%, a reliability ratio of 93.2\%, and a probability ratio
   of 94.5\% compared to other existing methods.},

Title = {Undergraduate Medical Students? and Interns? Knowledge and Perception of
   Artificial Intelligence in Medicine},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {927-937},
Abstract = {Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly
   important role in healthcare and health professions education. This
   study explored medical students' and interns' knowledge of artificial
   intelligence (AI), perceptions of the role of AI in medicine, and
   preferences around the teaching of AI competencies.Methods: In this
   cross-sectional study, the authors used a previously validated Canadian
   questionnaire and gathered responses from students and interns at KIST
   Medical College, Nepal. Face validity and reliability of the tool were
   assessed by administering the questionnaire to 20 alumni as a pilot
   sample (Cronbach alpha = 0.6). Survey results were analyzed
   quantitatively (p-value = 0.05).Results: In total 216 students (37\%
   response rate) participated. The median AI knowledge score was 11
   (interquartile range 4), and the maximum possible score was 25. The
   score was higher among final year students (p = 0.006) and among those
   with additional training in AI (p = 0.040). Over 49\% strongly agreed or
   agreed that AI will reduce the number of jobs for doctors. Many expect
   AI to impact their specialty choice, felt the Nepalese health-care
   system is ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of AI, and opined
   every student of medicine should receive training on AI
   competencies.Conclusion: The lack of coverage of AI and machine learning
   in Nepalese medical schools has resulted in students being unaware of
   AI's impact on individual patients and the healthcare system. A high
   perceived willingness among respondents to learn about AI is a positive
   sign and a strong indicator of futuristic successful curricula changes.
   Systematic implementation of AI in the Nepalese healthcare system can be
   a potential tool in addressing health-care challenges related to
   resource and manpower constraints. Incorporating topics related to AI
   and machine learning in medical curricula can be a useful first step.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can reshape music education to
   enable students to learn musical instruments and compose music in a fun
   and easy way. This article examines the effectiveness of AI-enabled
   music teaching. The study seeks to incorporate AI-powered chatbots into
   piano classes in seven music schools and evaluate their effect on
   student performance. The results show that students who used the given
   app achieved better results than those enrolled in conventional classes.
   Overall, exploiting AI resulted in a 15\% increase in academic
   performance, but the intensity of training led to variation in
   achievements. With this app, the scores increased as follows: piano
   playing by 6.51\%; solfeggio and music literature by 4\%; and vocal
   signing by 0.56\%. The integration of chatbots in music education opens
   new developmental prospects. Based on the present findings, AI can be
   successfully integrated into music education.},

Abstract = {The aim of this article is to use decolonial thinking, as applied in the
   field of AI, to explore the ethical and pedagogical implications for
   higher education teaching and learning. The questions driving this
   article are: What does a decolonial approach to AI imply for higher
   education teaching and learning? How can educators, researchers and
   students interrogate the coloniality of AI in higher education? Which
   strategies can be useful for undoing the ethics of digital
   neocolonialism in higher education? While there is work on decolonial
   theory in AI as well as literature on the decolonization of higher
   education, there is not much theorization that brings those literatures
   together to develop a decolonial conceptual framework for ethical AI in
   higher education teaching and learning. This article offers this
   conceptual framing and suggests decolonial strategies that challenge
   algorithmic coloniality and colonial AI ethics in the context of higher
   education teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a
   computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention.
   Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots.
   The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic
   machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's
   lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery,
   named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da
   Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation.
   AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent
   machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad
   range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical
   statistics, and human biology up to and including today's ``omics{''}.
   AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main
   branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics
   approaches from deep learning information management to control of
   health management systems, including electronic health records, and
   active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical
   branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient
   or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted
   nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical
   complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of
   their medical utility, economic value, and development of
   interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Performance data in higher education has gone through a major
   development in the last few decades. Simple input measures have given
   way to increasingly nuanced and dynamic output measures and performance
   indicators have become an integral part of management at the
   organisational and system level. The evolution of higher education
   performance measurement shows a reiterative relationship between data
   availability, its purpose in a governance system and its target
   audience. Digitalisation of learning, management and communication
   systems has revolutionised data availability, creating new possibilities
   for `big data' use. Based on insights from the past evolution, current
   experiments with `big data' and lessons from other sectors, the article
   explores what the new `big data' era might mean for higher education
   governance. The high volume of data but also its speed of accumulation
   and related analytical techniques, are likely to substantially transform
   the current relationship between data and performance but also create
   some technical, ethical and policy challenges.},

Abstract = {We have examined the attitude and moral perception of 228 college
   students (63 Japanese and 165 non-Japanese) towards artificial
   intelligence (AI) in an international university in Japan. The students
   were asked to select a single most significant ethical issue associated
   with AI in the future from a list of nine ethical issues suggested by
   the World Economic Forum, and to explain why they believed that their
   chosen issues were most important. The majority of students (n = 149,
   65\%) chose unemployment as the major ethical issue related to AI. The
   second largest group of students (n = 29, 13\%) were concerned with
   ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on
   human behavior and emotion. The paper discusses the results in detail
   and concludes that, while policymakers must consider how to ameliorate
   the impact of AI on employment, AI engineers need to consider the
   emotional aspects of AI in research and development, as well.},

Title = {Research and Application of Artificial Intelligence Based on Electronic
   Health Records of Patients With Cancer: Systematic Review},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Pages = {36-46},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: With the accumulation of electronic health records and the
   development of artificial intelligence, patients with cancer urgently
   need new evidence of more personalized clinical and demographic
   characteristics and more sophisticated treatment and prevention
   strategies. However, no research has systematically analyzed the
   application and significance of artificial intelligence based on
   electronic health records in cancer care.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a review to introduce
   the current state and limitations of artificial intelligence based on
   electronic health records of patients with cancer and to summarize the
   performance of artificial intelligence in mining electronic health
   records and its impact on cancer care.
   Methods: Three databases were systematically searched to retrieve
   potentially relevant papers published from January 2009 to October 2020.
   Four principal reviewers assessed the quality of the papers and reviewed
   them for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria in the extracted
   data. The summary measures used in this analysis were the number and
   frequency of occurrence of the themes.
   Results: Of the 1034 papers considered, 148 papers met the inclusion
   criteria. Cancer care, especially cancers of female organs and digestive
   organs, could benefit from artificial intelligence based on electronic
   health records through cancer emergencies and prognostic estimates,
   cancer diagnosis and prediction, tumor stage detection, cancer case
   detection, and treatment pattern recognition. The models can always
   achieve an area under the curve of 0.7. Ensemble methods and deep
   learning are on the rise. In addition, electronic medical records in the
   existing studies are mainly in English and from private institutional
   databases.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence based on electronic health records
   performed well and could be useful for cancer care. Improving the
   performance of artificial intelligence can help patients receive more
   scientific-based and accurate treatments. There is a need for the
   development of new methods and electronic health record data sharing and
   for increased passion and support from cancer specialists.},

Abstract = {Education is facing the challenge of regulating how it will implement
   new educational models based on virtual assistants, artificial
   intelligence (AI), machine learning and natural language processing.
   This study aims to explain and understand how technologies based on
   AI-assisted virtual teachers could support higher education and
   self-directed learning, either by using a conversational interface
   (voice) or a 2D or 3D synthetic representation in environments of
   expanded realities. As this is an area that affects students, it is
   essential to understand their acceptance of these technologies. To
   ensure results are correctly interpreted, a taxonomy will be generated
   based on a study of the literature, and we will describe what these
   technologies would contribute as complementary training entities. The
   research method uses dual methodology, combining a theoretical
   perspective based on documentary analysis, and a structured Likert
   questionnaire completed by 662 university students. We employed a mixed
   system combining qualitative and quantitative interpretation. Taking a
   certain hermeneutic approach, the discussion phase also serves to debate
   the figure of the AI-assisted virtual teacher from the perspective of
   the conventional teacher. The results confirm that, although this
   paradigm is considered to be far off, it is appreciated that in the
   future it will be used as a useful resource.},

Abstract = {Exploring the physical mechanisms of complex systems and making

   spatiotemporal multiscale structure of complex systems, and its
   capability for analyzing complex problems has been validated in
   different fields. This paper proposes a research paradigm for AI, which
   introduces the analytical principles of mesoscience into the design of
   deep learning models. This is done to address the fundamental problem of
   deep learning models detaching the physical prototype from the problem
   being solved; the purpose is to promote the sustainable development of
   AI. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of Chinese

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 17},
Abstract = {Technological progress has a significant impact on higher education and
   increases the popularity of artificial intelligence technologies in
   universities of different countries. This research was based at Tianshui
   Normal University in China. The authors examined the impact of an
   interactive learning environment based on artificial intelligence in the
   context of the preservation of important cognitive functions such as IQ
   as well as long-term and short-term memory. This research enrolled 539
   s-year students. The experimental group (N = 322) consisted of students
   of the Faculty of Music, who have been studying music for more than one
   year using artificial intelligence technologies such as mobile
   applications, video games, music simulators, etc. The control group (N =
   217) consisted of students of the Faculty of Arts, who never used the
   potential of the interactive educational environment during their
   studies. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) was chosen as the
   main method. The test results showed that students in the control and
   experimental groups averaged the same normal intelligence (97.61). At
   the same time, there was no significant intergroup difference on all
   four scales: verbal comprehension, perceptual thinking, working memory,
   and information processing speed (P >= 0.05). It has been found that
   students in both groups equally rarely reported problems in terms of
   long-term or short-term memory (P >= 0.05). The findings can be used to
   intensify the scientific discussion about the threats and developmental
   potential of artificial intelligence in higher education.},

Title = {A systematic literature review on software defect prediction using
   artificial intelligence: Datasets, Data Validation Methods, Approaches,
   and Tools},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {111},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Delivering high-quality software products is a challenging task. It
   needs proper coordination from various teams in planning, execution, and
   testing. Many software products have high numbers of defects revealed in
   a production environment. Software failures are costly regarding money,
   time, and reputation for a business and even life-threatening if
   utilized in critical applications. Identifying and fixing software
   defects in the production system is costly, which could be a trivial
   task if detected before shipping the product. Binary classification is
   commonly used in existing software defect prediction studies. With the
   advancements in Artificial Intelligence techniques, there is a great
   potential to provide meaningful information to software development
   teams for producing quality software products. An extensive survey for
   Software Defect Prediction is necessary for exploring datasets, data
   validation methods, defect detection, and prediction approaches and
   tools. The survey infers standard datasets utilized in early studies
   lack adequate features and data validation techniques. According to the
   finding of the literature survey, the standard datasets has few labels,
   resulting in insufficient details regarding defects. Systematic
   Literature Reviews (SLR) on Software Defect Prediction are limited.
   Hence this SLR presents a comprehensive analysis of defect datasets,
   dataset validation, detection, prediction approaches, and tools for
   Software Defect Prediction. The survey exhibits the futuristic
   recommendations that will allow researchers to develop a tool for
   Software Defect Prediction. The survey introduces the architecture for
   developing a software prediction dataset with adequate features and
   statistical data validation techniques for multi-label classification
   for software defects.},

Abstract = {In the age of the Internet, basic education faces several new
   challenges: the lack of deep integration of artificial intelligence
   (AI), and the relatively poor quality of online teaching. To cope with
   these challenges, this paper designs an evaluation method for online
   teaching quality of basic education in the context of the AI. Firstly,
   the application of the AI in basic education was analyzed, and the
   promoting effect of online teaching on basic education was confirmed. On
   this basis, the entropy weight method and grey clustering analysis were
   introduced to evaluate the online teaching quality of basic education.
   Based on the proposed model, several strategies were proposed to improve
   the quality of online teaching in basic education. The research results
   provide a good reference for the application of online teaching and AI

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to identify the differences in various
   aspects of the perception of artificial intelligence by students of
   economics and business studies at different levels of study and, on this
   basis, to formulate recommendations both to the higher education
   institutions themselves, which educate in the field of economic and
   business sciences, as well as to curriculum designers. First, we
   utilized descriptive statistics to analyze the responses for each
   construct among undergraduate and postgraduate students. In the second
   part, we employed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests to
   assess the normality of data distribution. Finally, in the third part,
   we employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to identify the
   differences between undergraduate and postgraduate students. The results
   show that statistically significant differences can be identified
   especially in how students of both study levels see and understand the
   importance of AI. Although we did not identify significant differences
   between students of both levels in how they see their role in the future
   labor market, which will be (or already is) characterized by artificial
   intelligence, we must emphasize that students of both levels evaluate
   their roles modestly in this respect. Therefore, on this basis, we have
   made recommendations for more active development and integration of AI
   in the study process; the article presents important suggestions for
   improving education to prepare students for the business world of

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Pages = {4820-4828},
Abstract = {Background: Human society has entered the age of artificial
   intelligence, medical practice and medical education are undergoing
   profound changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now applied in many
   industries, particularly in healthcare and medical education, where it
   deeply intersects. The purpose of this paper is to overview the current
   situation and problems of ``AI+medicine/medical{''} education and to
   provide our own perspective on the current predicament. Methods: We
   searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and CNKI databases to assess the
   literature on AI+medical/medical education from 2017 to July 2022. The
   main inclusion criteria include literature describing the current
   situation or predicament of ``AI+medical/medical education{''}. Results:
   Studies have shown that the current application of AI in medical
   education is focused on clinical specialty training and continuing
   education, with the main application areas being radiology, diagnostics,
   surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. The main role is to assist
   physicians to improve their efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the
   field of combining AI with medicine/medical education is steadily
   expanding, and the most urgent need is for policy makers, experts in the
   medical field, AI and education, and experts in other fields to come
   together to reach consensus on ethical issues and develop regulatory
   standards. Our study also found that most medical students are positive
   about adding AI-related courses to the existing medical curriculum.
   Finally, the quality of research on ``AI+medical/medical education{''}
   is poor. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our study
   provides an innovative systematic review of the latest
   ``AI+medicine/medical curriculum{''}. Since the AI+medicine curriculum
   is not yet regulated, we have made some suggestions.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence, and digitization has been around for several
   years, but its use has become a necessity with the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Lockdown forced us to work remotely overnight, to use digital networks
   to communicate, to make payments, or to attend classes for our
   education, within an online environment. All sectors of activity were
   forced to adapt to the digital age in one night. More than this the new
   generation of students grown up with the access to new technology, using
   different applications to access information. This paper shows how
   teaching, and the study plan can be improved using new technologies to
   achieve the course learning outcomes in a virtual environment. The
   research was carried out through successive interviews with
   representatives of higher education institutions, students, and
   professors from finance and business management specializations. The
   paper proposes a realistic academic plan design - backward partially
   based on the collaboration between human intelligence and artificial
   intelligence - machine learning. Taking into account new environmental
   and digital challenges, the backward design facilitates the decision on
   the content of the study plan, the elimination of less important parts,
   and the application of new communication and assessment techniques.},

Title = {The Ethics of Emotional Artificial Intelligence: A Mixed Method Analysis},
Journal = {ASIAN BIOETHICS REVIEW},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 2},
Abstract = {Emotions play a significant role in human relations, decision-making,
   and the motivation to act on those decisions. There are ongoing attempts
   to use artificial intelligence (AI) to read human emotions, and to
   predict human behavior or actions that may follow those emotions.
   However, a person's emotions cannot be easily identified, measured, and
   evaluated by others, including automated machines and algorithms run by
   AI. The ethics of emotional AI is under research and this study has
   examined the emotional variables as well as the perception of emotional
   AI in two large random groups of college students in an international
   university in Japan, with a heavy representation of Japanese,
   Indonesian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and other Asian
   nationalities. Surveys with multiple close-ended questions and an
   open-ended essay question regarding emotional AI were administered for
   quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. The results
   demonstrate how ethically questionable results may be obtained through
   affective computing and by searching for correlations in a variety of
   factors in collected data to classify individuals into certain
   categories and thus aggravate bias and discrimination. Nevertheless, the
   qualitative study of students' essays shows a rather optimistic view
   over the use of emotional AI, which helps underscore the need to
   increase awareness about the ethical pitfalls of AI technologies in the
   complex field of human emotions.},

Abstract = {This work presents an active learning methodology called Project-based
   learning (PBL) for developing artificial intelligence (AI) in a computer
   vision course of an undergraduate engineering degree. The objective of
   the course was to develop image recognition capabilities using Deep

   PBL learning methodology helped students search for real-world problems,
   develop complex solutions, and generate synergy among team members. The
   main role of the professor was to advise, guide and motivate the
   students throughout the course. The pedagogic innovation with active
   learning methodologies offered the professor the opportunity to create a
   dynamic motivating learning environment based on experiences. Each
   undergraduate engineering student had the opportunity to develop the
   skills and techniques of their profession: teamwork, proactivity,
   innovation, and leadership. The results obtained by the student teams
   showed problem-solving, including the use of automatic navigation
   equipment with AI, detection of the malaria parasite, recognition of
   non-human individuals to control vehicular traffic.},

Abstract = {As the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical
   setting increases, the need for clinicians to understand AI is also
   increasing. This review focuses on the fundamental principles of AI and
   the current state of cardiovascular AI. Various types of cardiovascular
   AI have been developed for evaluating examinations such as X-rays,
   electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic
   resonance imaging. Cardiovascular AI achieves high accuracy in
   diagnostic support and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, it can even
   detect abnormalities that were previously difficult for cardiologists to
   detect. Randomized controlled trials begin to be reported to verify the
   usefulness of cardiovascular AI. The day is approaching when
   cardiovascular AI will be commonly used in clinical practice. Various
   types of medical AI will be used for cardiovascular care; however, it
   will not replace medical doctors. We need to understand the strengths
   and weaknesses of medical AI so that cardiologists can effectively use
   AI to improve the medical care of patients. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence systems such as early warning systems are
   becoming more common in Higher Education. However, the students'
   reactions to such techno-pedagogical innovations are much less explored
   in settings beyond the development and testing. This paper analyses the
   students' acceptance of an early warning system developed at a fully
   online university. Following a pre-usage and post-usage experimental
   design based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
   model and the Structural Equation Modelling, we observed how, within
   four courses (839 participants in the academic year 2019-20, of which
   347 participants answered both a pre-and post-usage questionnaire), the
   students' acceptance changed overtime. Our findings revealed a
   disconfirmation effect in the acceptance of the early warning system,
   namely, a difference between expectations surrounding the technology
   pre-and post-usage, and shed light on the ways artificial intelligence
   systems should be integrated within Higher Education virtual classrooms.},

Title = {The impact of artificial intelligence on learner-instructor interaction
   in online learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems offer effective support for online
   learning and teaching, including personalizing learning for students,
   automating instructors' routine tasks, and powering adaptive
   assessments. However, while the opportunities for AI are promising, the
   impact of AI systems on the culture of, norms in, and expectations about
   interactions between students and instructors are still elusive. In
   online learning, learner-instructor interaction (inter alia,
   communication, support, and presence) has a profound impact on students'
   satisfaction and learning outcomes. Thus, identifying how students and
   instructors perceive the impact of AI systems on their interaction is
   important to identify any gaps, challenges, or barriers preventing AI
   systems from achieving their intended potential and risking the safety
   of these interactions. To address this need for forward-looking
   decisions, we used Speed Dating with storyboards to analyze the
   authentic voices of 12 students and 11 instructors on diverse use cases
   of possible AI systems in online learning. Findings show that
   participants envision adopting AI systems in online learning can enable
   personalized learner-instructor interaction at scale but at the risk of
   violating social boundaries. Although AI systems have been positively
   recognized for improving the quantity and quality of communication, for
   providing just-in-time, personalized support for large-scale settings,
   and for improving the feeling of connection, there were concerns about
   responsibility, agency, and surveillance issues. These findings have
   implications for the design of AI systems to ensure explainability,
   human-in-the-loop, and careful data collection and presentation.
   Overall, contributions of this study include the design of AI system
   storyboards which are technically feasible and positively support
   learner-instructor interaction, capturing students' and instructors'
   concerns of AI systems through Speed Dating, and suggesting practical
   implications for maximizing the positive impact of AI systems while
   minimizing the negative ones.},

Abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation is a paroxysmal heart disease without any
   obvious symptoms for most people during the onset. The electrocardiogram
   (ECG) at the time other than the onset of this disease is not
   significantly different from that of normal people, which makes it
   difficult to detect and diagnose. However, if atrial fibrillation is not
   detected and treated early, it tends to worsen the condition and
   increase the possibility of stroke. In this paper, P-wave morphology
   parameters and heart rate variability feature parameters were
   simultaneously extracted from the ECG. A total of 31 parameters were
   used as input variables to perform the modeling of artificial
   intelligence ensemble learning model. Results This paper applied three
   artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods, namely Bagging
   ensemble learning method, AdaBoost ensemble learning method, and
   Stacking ensemble learning method. The prediction results of these three
   artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods were compared. As a
   result of the comparison, the Stacking ensemble learning method combined
   with various models finally obtained the best prediction effect with the
   accuracy of 92\%, sensitivity of 88\%, specificity of 96\%, positive
   predictive value of 95.7\%, negative predictive value of 88.9\%, F1
   score of 0.9231 and area under receiver operating characteristic curve
   value of 0.911. Conclusion In feature extraction, this paper combined
   P-wave morphology parameters and heart rate variability parameters as
   input parameters for model training, and validated the value of the
   proposed parameters combination for the improvement of the model's
   predicting effect. In the calculation of the P-wave morphology
   parameters, the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm was used to obtain more
   accurate Gaussian function fitting parameters. The prediction model was
   trained using the Stacking ensemble learning method, so that the model
   accuracy had better results, which can further improve the early
   prediction of atrial fibrillation.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence speech recognition technology is an important
   direction in the field of human-computer interaction. The use of speech
   recognition technology to assist teachers in the correction of spoken
   English pronunciation in teaching has certain effects and can help
   students without being constrained by places, time and teachers. Based
   on artificial intelligence speech recognition technology, this paper
   improves and analyzes speech recognition algorithms, and uses effective
   algorithms as the system algorithms of artificial intelligence models.
   Meanwhile, based on phoneme-level speech error correction, after
   introducing the basic knowledge, construction and training of acoustic
   models, the basic process of speech cutting, including the front-end
   processing of speech and the extraction of feature parameters, is
   elaborated. In addition, this study designed a control experiment to
   verify and analyze the artificial intelligence speech recognition
   correction model. The research results show that the method proposed in
   this paper has a certain effect.},

Title = {A bibliometric analysis of artificial intelligence chatbots in
   educational contexts},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 28},
Abstract = {Purpose - The application of artificial intelligence chatbots is an
   emerging trend in educational technology studies for its multi-faceted
   advantages. However, the existing studies rarely take a perspective of
   educational technology application to evaluate the application of
   chatbots to educational contexts. This study aims to bridge the research
   gap by taking an educational perspective to review the existing
   literature on artificial intelligence chatbots.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study combines bibliometric analysis
   and citation network analysis: a bibliometric analysis through
   visualization of keyword, authors, organizations and countries and a
   citation network analysis based on literature clustering.Findings -
   Educational applications of chatbots are still rising in post-COVID-19
   learning environments. Popular research issues on this topic include
   technological advancements, students' perception of chatbots and
   effectiveness of chatbots in different educational contexts. Originating
   from similar technological and theoretical foundations, chatbots are
   primarily applied to language education, educational services (such as
   information counseling and automated grading), health-care education and
   medical training. Diversifying application contexts demonstrate specific
   purposes for using chatbots in education but are confronted with some
   common challenges. Multi-faceted factors can influence the effectiveness
   and acceptance of chatbots in education. This study provides an extended
   framework to facilitate extending artificial intelligence chatbot
   applications in education. Research limitations/implications - The
   authors have to acknowledge that this study is subjected to some
   limitations. First, the literature search was based on the core
   collection on Web of Science, which did not include some existing
   studies. Second, this bibliometric analysis only included studies
   published in English. Third, due to the limitation in technological
   expertise, the authors could not comprehensively interpret the
   implications of some studies reporting technological advancements.
   However, this study intended to establish its research significance by
   summarizing and evaluating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence
   chatbots from an educational perspective.Originality/value - This study
   identifies the publication trends of artificial intelligence chatbots in
   educational contexts. It bridges the research gap caused by previous
   neglection of treating educational contexts as an interconnected whole
   which can demonstrate its characteristics. It identifies the major
   application contexts of artificial intelligence chatbots in education
   and encouraged further extending of applications. It also proposes an
   extended framework to consider that covers three critical components of
   technological integration in education when future researchers and
   instructors apply artificial intelligence chatbots to new educational
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence techniques have solved some previously
   intractable problems and produced impressive results in selected medical
   domains. One of their drawbacks is that they often need very large
   amounts of data. Pre-existing datasets in the form of national cancer
   registries, image/genetic depositories and clinical datasets already
   exist and have been used for research. In theory, the combination of
   healthcare Big Data with modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence
   techniques should offer significant opportunities for artificial
   intelligence development, but this has not yet happened. Here we discuss
   some of the structural reasons for this, barriers preventing artificial
   intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, and make
   suggestions as to enable progress. To do this, we use the framework of
   the 6Vs of Big Data and the FAIR criteria for data sharing and
   availability (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse).
   We share our experience in navigating these barriers through The Brain
   Tumour Data Accelerator, a Brain Tumour Charity-supported initiative to
   integrate fragmented patient data into an enriched dataset. We conclude
   with some comments as to the limits of such approaches. (c) 2021 The

   verification, security and surveillance, electronic voice eavesdropping,
   mobile banking and mobile shopping. Recent advancements in deep learning
   and other hardware techniques have gained attention of researchers
   working in the field of automatic speaker identification (SI). However,
   to the best of our knowledge, there is no in-depth survey is available
   that critically appraises and summarizes the existing techniques with
   their strengths and weaknesses for SI. Hence, this study identified and
   discussed various areas of SI, presented a comprehensive survey of

Abstract = {Nowadays, in various educational institutions, artificial intelligence
   technology is applied effectively and successfully. This artificial
   intelligence improves learning and student development in academic
   performance. Challenges of the conventional education approach,
   students' dependence on teachers in all resources for study,
   unavailability of professional instructors, and a greater focus on
   conditioning learning than practical usefulness lead to lower learning
   performance. In this paper integrated teaching-learning model approach
   has been proposed using artificial intelligence in student education. It
   involves speeding up fulfilling education targets by reducing barriers
   to entry, automating management processes, and maximizing learning
   performance. The proposed ITLMA method used the naive Bayes algorithm to
   evaluate the student ranking using a class score, task, project score,
   and final exam. The result of artificial intelligence-based ITLMA and
   naive Bayes algorithm hasa high accuracy ratio of 80.1\% with less error
   ratio of 15.7\%, high prediction 88.2\%, precision 98.2\%, and improves
   student and teacher interaction compared to other existing methods.},

   algorithms and models such as artificial neural networks, machine
   learning, support vector regression, and fuzzy logic models can greatly
   contribute to improving hydrogen energy production, storage, and
   transportation. They play an important role in predicting various
   parameters, safety protocols and management of hydrogen production.
   Furthermore, advances in artificial intelligence are expected to bring
   huge state-of-the-art technologies and tools for hydrogen and battery
   technology that could help solve the current energy-oriented crises and
   problems. This review provides insight into the feasibility of
   state-of-the-art artificial intelligence for hydrogen and battery
   technology. The primary focus is to demonstrate the contribution of
   various AI techniques, its algorithms and models in hydrogen energy
   industry, as well as smart battery manufacturing, and optimization.

Abstract = {Introduction Peptidomics is an emerging field of omics sciences using
   advanced isolation, analysis, and computational techniques that enable
   qualitative and quantitative analyses of various peptides in biological
   samples. Peptides can act as useful biomarkers and as therapeutic
   molecules for diseases Areas covered The use of therapeutic peptides can
   be predicted quickly and efficiently using data-driven computational
   methods, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Various AI
   approaches are useful for peptide-based drug discovery, such as support
   vector machine, random forest, extremely randomized trees, and other
   more recently developed deep learning methods. AI methods are relatively
   new to the development of peptide-based therapies, but these techniques
   already become essential tools in protein science by dissecting novel
   therapeutic peptides and their functions (Figure 1). Expert opinion
   Researchers have shown that AI models can facilitate the development of
   peptidomics and selective peptide therapies in the field of peptide
   science. Biopeptide prediction is important for the discovery and
   development of successful peptide-based drugs. Due to their ability to
   predict therapeutic roles based on sequence details, many AI-dependent
   prediction tools have been developed (Figure 1).},

Abstract = {Higher education institutions have access to higher volumes and a
   greater variety and granularity of student data, often in real-time,
   than ever before. As such, the collection, analysis and use of student
   data are increasingly crucial in operational and strategic planning, and
   in delivering appropriate and effective learning experiences to
   students. Student data - not only in what data is (not) collected, but
   also how the data is framed and used - has material and discursive
   effects, both permanent and fleeting. We have to critically engage
   claims that artificial intelligence and the ever expansive/expanding
   systems of algorithmic decision-making provide speedy, accessible,
   revealing, panoramic, prophetic and smart analyses of students' risks,
   potential and learning needs. We need to pry open the black boxes higher
   education institutions (and increasingly venture capital and learning
   management system providers) use to admit, steer, predict and prescribe
   students' learning journeys.},

Abstract = {This research investigates blockchain technology, focusing on the
   influence of motivation on collaborative work, which positively
   influences learning performance in Higher Education Institutions (HEI).
   In addition, blockchain technology is correlated with decentralisation,
   security and integrity, and anonymity and encryption. It can also be
   perceived as a consensus mechanism, rewarding students, professors, and
   universities as a smart contract. Therefore, this technology has been
   used to improve higher education. It also allows less informed people to
   interact with better-informed peers and mentors. Finally, this study
   aims to enhance the current state of blockchain applications
   comprehension. The methodology used for this research includes document
   analysis, literature review, content analysis (blockchain platforms),
   the case study method, and the survey method. In statistical
   considerations, aiming to evaluate indicators, this research presents
   the Composite Reliability Analysis, Cronbach Alpha Coefficients, and the
   Bootstrapping method (Variance Inflation Factor). All these analyses
   aimed to present a designed research model. This exploratory research
   gathered data from 150 students at 3 universities in Serbia, Romania,
   and Portugal. As demonstrated, using student motivation has a
   significant and positive impact on the quality of student collaborative
   work. Student collaborative work also correlates with students' higher
   level of engagement in the educational process, and the more engaged
   students are, the better their learning outcomes will be. As a result,
   in higher education, student involvement boosted learning outcomes.
   Researchers found that motivation, teamwork, and student involvement
   were important factors in improving student learning outcomes, as were
   blockchain-based tools. The results from the quantitative analysis
   indicate that Collaborative work, Motivation, Engagement, MOOCs, AR, VR,
   Gamification, and Online class were associated with learning
   performance.},

Abstract = {English reading plays an important role in promoting oral English and
   comprehensive English ability. At present, the traditional online

Abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that can enrich the learning and
   teaching experience in higher education. In recent years, the
   development of AR in higher education has become increasingly popular.
   This study report on overall research trends regarding research progress
   in the field of AR in higher education. The research method used is
   bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer. The data is taken from the Scopus
   database. The findings show an increasing trend of citations and
   publications indicating concern in AR use has been seen over the last
   decade. AR research in higher education started in 2006 until now. The
   most productive year was in 2021 producing as many as 91 articles and
   the most citations in 2017 amounting to 639 documents. Analysis of the
   data revealed that the top three ranking researchers (Marques, Moreira,
   and Osadchyi), countries (Spain, United States, United Kingdom),
   Organization (Universidad de la Laguna and Universiti Utara Malaysia),
   Journal (Ceur Workshop Proceedings, Lecture Notes In Computer Science
   Including Subseries Lecture Notes In Artificial Intelligence And Lecture
   Notes In Bioinformatics, ACM International Conference Proceeding
   Series). Furthermore, the main finding of this research is that the
   subject area that uses the most AR technology is the subject of computer
   science. Overall, this research that AR is no longer a technology that
   makes users feel in an unreal world but is accompanied by a real world
   that makes users feel real things. This technology is very practical in
   today's needs. The area of AR still has a lot of room for investigation,

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a
   branch of science that empowers machines using human intelligence. AI
   refers to the technology of rendering human intelligence through
   computer programs. From healthcare to the precise prevention, diagnosis,
   and management of diseases, AI is progressing rapidly in various
   interdisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology. Ophthalmology is at
   the forefront of AI in medicine because the diagnosis of ocular diseases
   heavy reliance on imaging. Recently, deep learning-based AI screening
   and prediction models have been applied to the most common visual
   impairment and blindness diseases, including glaucoma, cataract,
   age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
   The success of AI in medicine is primarily attributed to the development
   of deep learning algorithms, which are computational models composed of
   multiple layers of simulated neurons. These models can learn the
   representations of data at multiple levels of abstraction. The
   Inception-v3 algorithm and transfer learning concept have been applied
   in DR and ARMD to reuse fundus image features learned from natural
   images (non-medical images) to train an AI system with a fraction of the
   commonly used training data (<1\%). The trained AI system achieved
   performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying ARMD and
   diabetic macular edema on optical coherence tomography images. In this
   study, we highlight the fundamental concepts of AI and its application
   in these four major ocular diseases and further discuss the current
   challenges, as well as the prospects in ophthalmology.},

Abstract = {Educational systems have advanced with the use of electronic learning
   (e-learning), which is a promising solution for long-distance learners.
   Students who engage in e-learning can access tests and exams online,
   making education more flexible and accessible. This work reports on the
   design of an e-learning system that makes recommendations to students to
   improve their learning. This artificial intelligence-based student
   assessment and recommendation (AISAR) system consists of score
   estimation, clustering, performance prediction, and recommendation. In
   addition, the importance of student authentication is recognised in
   situations in which students must authenticate themselves prior to using
   the e-learning system using their identity, password, and personal
   identification number. Individual scores are determined using a
   recurrent neural network (RNN) based on student engagement and
   examination scores. Then, a density-based spatial clustering algorithm
   (DBSCAN) using Mahalanobis distance clustering is implemented to group
   students based on their obtained score values. The constructed clusters
   are validated by estimating purity and entropy. Student performance is
   predicted using a threshold-based MapReduce (TMR) procedure from the
   score-based cluster. When predicting student performance, students are
   classified into two groups: average and poor, with the former being
   divided into below- and above-average students and the latter into poor
   and very poor students. This categorisation aims to provide useful
   recommendations for learning. A recommendation reinforcement learning
   algorithm, the rule-based state-action-reward-state-action (R-SARSA)
   algorithm, is incorporated for evaluation. Students were required to
   work on their subjects according to the provided recommendations. This
   e-learning recommendation system achieves better performance in terms of
   true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, false-negatives,
   precision, recall, and accuracy.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that
   enables machines to learn, reason, and problem solve. In recent decades,
   AI has been developed with the aim of improving the management of
   patients with brain tumours. This review article explores the role AI
   currently plays in managing patients undergoing brain tumour surgery,
   and explores how AI may impact this field in the future.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms have the potential to cause a
   paradigm shift in brain tumour surgery. Brain tumour surgery augmented
   with AI can result in safer and more effective treatment. In this review
   article, we explore the current and future role of AI in patients
   undergoing brain tumour surgery, including aiding diagnosis, optimising
   the surgical plan, providing support during the operation, and better
   predicting the prognosis. Finally, we discuss barriers to the successful
   clinical implementation, the ethical concerns, and we provide our
   perspective on how the field could be advanced.},

Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Food safety is a pressing concern for human society, as it directly
   impacts people's lives, while food freshness serves as one of the most
   crucial indicators in ensuring food safety. There exist diverse
   techniques for monitoring food freshness, among which intelligent
   packaging based on artificial intelligence technology boasts the
   advantages of low cost, high efficiency, fast speed and wide
   applicability; however, it is currently underutilized. By analyzing the
   current research status of intelligent packaging both domestically and
   internationally, this paper provides a clear classification of
   intelligent packaging technology. Additionally, it outlines the
   advantages and disadvantages of using intelligent packaging technology
   for food freshness detection methods, while summarizing the latest
   research progress in applying artificial intelligence-based technologies
   to food freshness detection through intelligent packaging. Finally, the
   author points out the limitations of the current research, and
   anticipates future developments in artificial intelligence technology
   for assisting freshness detection in intelligent packaging. This will
   provide valuable insights for the future development of intelligent
   packaging in the field of food freshness detection.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Earth system sciences are urgently calling for
   innovation on improving accuracy, enhancing model intelligence level,
   scaling up operation, and reducing costs in many subdomains amid the
   exponentially accumulated datasets and the promising artificial
   intelligence (AI) revolution in computer science. This paper presents
   work led by the NASA Earth Science Data Systems Working Groups and ESIP
   machine learning cluster to give a comprehensive overview of AI in Earth
   sciences. It holistically introduces the current status, technology, use
   cases, challenges, and opportunities, and provides all the levels of AI
   practitioners in geosciences with an overall big picture and to ``blow
   away the fog to get a clearer vision{''} about the future development of
   Earth AI. The paper covers all the majorspheres in the Earth system and
   investigates representative AI research in each domain. Widely used AI
   algorithms and computing cyberinfrastructure are briefly introduced. The
   mandatory steps in a typical workflow of specializing AI to solve Earth
   scientific problems are decomposed and analyzed. Eventually, it
   concludes with the grand challenges and reveals the opportunities to
   give some guidance and pre-warnings on allocating resources wisely to
   achieve the ambitious Earth AI goals in the future.},

Abstract = {In this 60th anniversary of Business \& Society essay, we seek to make
   three main contributions at the intersection of governance and
   artificial intelligence (AI). First, we aim to illuminate some of the
   deeper social, legal, organizational, and democratic challenges of
   rising AI adoption and resulting algorithmic power by reviewing AI
   research through a governance lens. Second, we propose an AI governance
   framework that aims to better assess AI challenges as well as how
   different governance modalities (architecture, laws, norms, and market)
   can support AI. At the heart of our framework lies the governance forces
   that apply to institutions, organizations, and individuals, who
   ultimately provide, regulate, and use AI decision-making. We discuss how
   businesses may harness AI's economic power through governance solutions
   without creating or amplifying societal biases and inequalities. Third,
   as part of our section on future research, we identify a set of
   governance trade-offs in AI adoption, suggest future research avenues to
   conceptually strengthen research on the governance of AI, and lay out
   key policy recommendations.},

Title = {A Preliminary Survey of Muslim Experts' Views on Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {ISLAMIYYAT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC STUDIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {There should be a great deal of concern over the extensive and still
   expanding application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in
   Muslim life today. From the use of smartphones, drones, robots,
   autonomous vehicles and weapons technologies, the transformation caused
   by AI is significantly positive but much is still up for debate and
   contemplation. In fact, some Muslims may merely consider this rapid
   growth of AI as part of science fiction which is being popularised in
   movies. This incognizant view is dangerous because Muslims may not be
   alert to unforeseen AI impact especially when it crosses over Islamic
   ethical or legal limits. These interpretations should provide an
   appropriate context for Muslim experts today to rethink their views with
   regards to the transformative impact of AI on Muslim society. This
   preliminary study therefore, is conducted to gather Muslim experts'
   professional views on AI related issues. Using a quantitative
   methodology approach with a cross-sectional study design, 37 experts
   responded to the personal, online questionnaire emailed to them. The
   findings generally indicate the respondents' insensitivity towards the
   greater extent of AI impact on Muslim consumers at large. However, most
   of the respondents were agreeable on the urgent need for regulations so
   that AI is geared and harvested for its benefits in enhancing Muslim
   life. This signifies the importance of thorough and strict regulations
   for AI research and technology to adhere to Islamic principles. A
   specific framework development underpinned by Maqasid al-Shari'ah is
   recommended to address the various contemporary issues of AI impact.},

Title = {AI-Based Chatbots Adoption Model for Higher-Education Institutions: A
   Hybrid PLS-SEM-Neural Network Modelling Approach},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Chatbot implementation for assisting customers as a virtual agent can be
   seen as a tool in helping an organisation to serve better customer
   service. Malaysia is among the countries forging ahead with the Fourth
   Industrial Revolution. One of the core technologies mentioned is
   adopting artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots. In the last few
   years, there has been a growing interest in AI-based chatbot adoption in
   the non-HEI context. However, most higher-education institutions (HEIs)
   are reported not ready to adopt AI-based chatbots as one of the
   solutions for virtual student services support. The research of chatbot
   adoption in the HEI context is still new and is a less explored and
   examined topic in the information systems domain. Moreover, most of the
   existing research regarding chatbot adoption in the HEI context focuses
   more on the benefit of chatbot usage and is not specialised in a student
   services solution perspective. Furthermore, most of the studies were not
   guided by the information systems (IS) theories. Therefore, this study
   aims to identify factors that influence the effectiveness of chatbot
   adoption in the HEI context by adapting the UTAUT2 model as the IS
   theory reference. A survey method was applied using the purposive
   sampling technique. For 3 months, data were collected online from 302
   users of Malaysia's HEI postgraduate students from various public and
   private universities. A two-stage analytical procedure (SEM-ANN) was
   used to validate the research model and assess the presented research
   hypotheses. This research reveals that perceived trust is influenced by
   interactivity, design, and ethics. Meanwhile, behavioural intention is
   influenced by perceived trust, performance expectancy, and habit towards
   the use of chatbot applications in the HEI context. Lastly, the findings
   of this study can be helpful to the HEI student services unit and can be
   a guide towards productivity and marketing strategy in serving the
   students better.},

Title = {Advancements in Oncology with Artificial Intelligence-A Review Article},
Journal = {CANCERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Simple Summary With the advancement of artificial intelligence,
   including machine learning, the field of oncology has seen promising
   results in cancer detection and classification, epigenetics, drug
   discovery, and prognostication. In this review, we describe what
   artificial intelligence is and its function, as well as comprehensively
   summarize its evolution and role in breast, colorectal, and central
   nervous system cancers. Understanding the origin and current
   accomplishments might be essential to improve the quality, accuracy,
   generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability of artificial
   intelligence models that can be used in worldwide clinical practice.
   Students and researchers in the medical field will benefit from a deeper
   understanding of how to use integrative AI in oncology for innovation
   and research. Well-trained machine learning (ML) and artificial
   intelligence (AI) systems can provide clinicians with therapeutic
   assistance, potentially increasing efficiency and improving efficacy. ML
   has demonstrated high accuracy in oncology-related diagnostic imaging,
   including screening mammography interpretation, colon polyp detection,
   glioma classification, and grading. By utilizing ML techniques, the
   manual steps of detecting and segmenting lesions are greatly reduced.
   ML-based tumor imaging analysis is independent of the experience level
   of evaluating physicians, and the results are expected to be more
   standardized and accurate. One of the biggest challenges is its
   generalizability worldwide. The current detection and screening methods
   for colon polyps and breast cancer have a vast amount of data, so they
   are ideal areas for studying the global standardization of artificial
   intelligence. Central nervous system cancers are rare and have poor
   prognoses based on current management standards. ML offers the prospect
   of unraveling undiscovered features from routinely acquired neuroimaging
   for improving treatment planning, prognostication, monitoring, and
   response assessment of CNS tumors such as gliomas. By studying AI in
   such rare cancer types, standard management methods may be improved by
   augmenting personalized/precision medicine. This review aims to provide
   clinicians and medical researchers with a basic understanding of how ML
   works and its role in oncology, especially in breast cancer, colorectal
   cancer, and primary and metastatic brain cancer. Understanding AI
   basics, current achievements, and future challenges are crucial in
   advancing the use of AI in oncology.},

Abstract = {The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused
   millions of deaths and affected the livelihood of many more people.
   Early and rapid detection of COVID-19 is a challenging task for the
   medical community, but it is also crucial in stopping the spread of the
   SARS-CoV-2 virus. Prior substantiation of artificial intelligence (AI)
   in various fields of science has encouraged researchers to further
   address this problem. Various medical imaging modalities including
   X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) using AI techniques
   have greatly helped to curb the COVID-19 outbreak by assisting with
   early diagnosis. We carried out a systematic review on state-of-the-art
   AI techniques applied with X-ray, CT, and US images to detect COVID-19.
   In this paper, we discuss approaches used by various authors and the
   significance of these research efforts, the potential challenges, and
   future trends related to the implementation of an AI system for disease
   detection during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {The main goal of this article is to understand the potential learning
   applications based on AI technologies for health higher education
   students. We employed a Systematic Literature Review, contributing to
   explore to what extent AI technologies are currently influencing the
   Health learning processes in higher education and the skills developed
   during the learning path. The intent is to contribute to a more profound
   understanding of learning contexts, methodologies, technologies, and
   pedagogical processes with the application of AI technologies. The
   literature emphasizes that AI can be used to potentiate the learning
   process and the learning outcomes, especially in laboratory classes, and
   such contexts are still largely unstudied. To fulfil this gap, some
   practical applications based on AI technologies applied to health higher
   education studies were identified, highlighting AI's innovations and
   possible opportunities for health higher education.},

Abstract = {Traditional physical education in colleges and universities is difficult
   to arouse students' interest in sports, resulting in low activity
   participation rate and inability to exercise the body. How to
   effectively improve the effectiveness of physical education in colleges
   and universities has become one of the hot topics of most concern from
   all walks of life. In physical education, innovative teaching concepts
   and methods, teaching methods and processes, and teaching evaluation
   methods are all conducive to improving the classroom atmosphere of
   physical education and successfully improve the effectiveness of
   physical education. This article focuses on analyzing the current status
   of physical education in colleges and universities. Based on the rapid
   development of artificial intelligence technology, how to improve the
   effectiveness of physical education is studied, and an experimental
   method is used to compare and analyze physical education in a college.
   The analysis results show that artificial intelligence-based physical
   education can obviously improve students' strength quality, speed
   quality, endurance quality, and agility quality, which provides a more
   important reference and reference for improving the effectiveness of
   college physical education.},

Title = {Application of artificial intelligence methods in vital signs analysis
   of hospitalized patients: A systematic literature review},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {96},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In a hospital environment, patients are monitored continuously by
   electronic devices and health professionals. Therefore, a large amount
   of data is collected and stored in electronic health records systems for
   each patient. Among such data, vital signs are one of the most common
   and relevant types of information monitored to assess a patient's health
   status. Artificial intelligence techniques can be used to analyze and
   learn useful standards from clinical datasets to provide better evidence
   to support the decisions of health professionals and thus help to
   improve patient health outcomes in hospitals. This systematic literature
   review aims to provide an updated computational perspective of how
   artificial intelligence has been applied to analyze the vital signs of
   adult hospitalized patients and the outcomes obtained. To this end, we
   reviewed 2899 scientific articles published between 2008 and 2018 and
   selected 78 articles that met our inclusion criteria to answer the
   research questions. Moreover, we used the information found in the
   reviewed articles to propose a taxonomy and identified the main
   concerns, challenges, and opportunities in this field. Our findings
   demonstrate that many researchers are exploring the use of artificial
   intelligence methods in tasks related to improving the health outcomes
   of hospitalized patients in distinct units. Additionally, although vital
   signs are significant predictors of clinical deterioration, they are not
   analyzed in isolation to predict or identify a clinical outcome. Our
   taxonomy and discussion contribute to the achievement of a significant
   degree of coverage regarding the aspects related to using machine
   learning to improve health outcomes in hospital environments, while
   highlighting gaps in the literature for future research. (C) 2020

   ``knowledge forgetting curve,{''} the method of fuzzy mathematical
   knowledge and differential modeling is used, the mathematical model and
   algorithm design of a new ``knowledge forgetting curve{''} is proposed.
   And the English word review program test is designed. The results show

Abstract = {Improving the quality of education is a challenging activity in every
   educational institution. Through this research paper, a model has been
   proposed representing the challenges in order to manage the trade-off to
   maintain the philosophy of continuous quality improvement and strict
   control based on higher education institutions (HEIs). Several standards
   criteria, performance parameters, and key performance indicators are
   studied and suggested for a quality self-assessment approach. After the
   data is collected, the significant features are selected for analysis of
   data using dedicated gain, which are designed by integrating the
   information gain and the dedicated weight constants. After that, deep
   learning methodologies like regression analysis, the artificial neural
   network, and the Matlab model are used for evaluating the academic
   quality of institutions. Finally, areas of development have been
   recommended using the probabilistic model to the administrators of the
   institutions based on the prediction made using a deep neural network.},

Abstract = {While molecular imaging with positron emission tomography or
   single-photon emission computed tomography already reports on tumour
   molecular mechanisms on a macroscopic scale, there is increasing
   evidence that there are multiple additional features within medical
   images that can further improve tumour characterization, treatment
   prediction and prognostication. Early reports have already revealed the
   power of radiomics to personalize and improve patient management and
   outcomes. What remains unclear is how these additional metrics relate to
   underlying molecular mechanisms of disease. Furthermore, the ability to
   deal with increasingly large amounts of data from medical images and
   beyond in a rapid, reproducible and transparent manner is essential for
   future clinical practice. Here, artificial intelligence (AI) may have an
   impact. AI encompasses a broad range of `intelligent' functions
   performed by computers, including language processing, knowledge
   representation, problem solving and planning. While rule-based
   algorithms, e.g. computer-aided diagnosis, have been in use for medical
   imaging since the 1990s, the resurgent interest in AI is related to
   improvements in computing power and advances in machine learning (ML).
   In this review we consider why molecular and cellular processes are of
   interest and which processes have already been exposed to AI and ML
   methods as reported in the literature. Non-small-cell lung cancer is
   used as an exemplar and the focus of this review as the most common
   tumour type in which AI and ML approaches have been tested and to
   illustrate some of the concepts.},

Abstract = {Air pollution is a major issue all over the world because of its impacts
   on the environment and human beings. The present review discussed the
   sources and impacts of pollutants on environmental and human health and
   the current research status on environmental pollution forecasting
   techniques in detail; this study presents a detailed discussion of the
   Artificial Intelligence methodologies and Machine learning (ML)
   algorithms used in environmental pollution forecasting and early-warning
   systems; moreover, the present work emphasizes more on Artificial
   Intelligence techniques (particularly Hybrid models) used for
   forecasting various major pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, O-3, CO, SO2,
   NO2, CO2) in detail; moreover, focus is given to AI and ML techniques in
   predicting chronic airway diseases and the prediction of climate changes
   and heat waves. The hybrid model has better performance than single AI
   models and it has greater accuracy in prediction and warning systems.
   The performance evaluation error indexes like R-2, RMSE, MAE and MAPE
   were highlighted in this study based on the performance of various AI
   models.},

   experience and the ability to analyze large quantities of data about
   their progress in residency, with substantially less manual effort than
   is currently required. Additionally, they will need to learn how to

Volume = {25},
Abstract = {This paper identifies key research on the factors that help to explain
   university dropout and how these factors are being explored by means of
   artificial intelligence (AI). The study describes the methodology
   employed to select 31 papers from a repository of 2,745 reported in the
   literature. The analysis centered on the main AI methods used and four
   categories of explanatory factors of university dropout: academic
   factors; factors associated with motivation and study habits;
   institutional factors; and economic and sociodemographic factors. The
   conclusion drawn from this literature review is that AI is most commonly
   used for decision tree-based classification, and most studies focus on
   predicting university dropout on the basis of explanatory factors.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a strategy of state-of-the-art review of artificial
   intelligence (AI) in education and a case study about preparing students
   to have the competencies and skills necessary for the current and future
   digital transformation to Industry 4.0. The goal is to support
   institutions of higher education to build curricula that help companies
   by providing them with qualified human capital to face the challenges of
   the twenty first century that have brought about the work environment
   now referred to as Industry 4.0 or the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The
   strategy consists of a business intelligence summary of AI trends and
   challenges of interest to academic institutions with an emphasis in
   intelligent human-computer communication and interactive design and
   manufacturing for educating engineers for the future enterprise. We also
   present a case study that builds upon 35 years of experience in offering
   AI academic programs in the institution, Tecnologico de Monterrey (Tec)
   to educate future engineers and knowledge workers. The components of our
   case study comprise graduate and undergraduate courses, research,
   internships, innovation, internationalization initiatives, and
   entrepreneurship. In this period, more than 5200 students have been
   trained at the Ph.D., MSc, and undergraduate levels with intense use of
   technology in the AI field. Now, the curricula of the university have
   been overhauled and renewed according to a new educative model known as
   the Tec21 Educative Model. The course offerings under this model are
   structured with challenge-based-learning, physical and virtual practice
   labs, and mixed teaching methodologies to accommodate the digital
   transformation and demands of Industry 4.0 to educate and prepare the
   new generation of students. The strategy and case study presented may be
   useful guides for other higher education institutions implementing AI
   academic programs to educate students demanded by the companies of the
   XXI century.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting technology that can
   transform the practice of radiology. However, radiology AI is still
   immature with limited adopters, dominated by academic institutions, and
   few use cases in general practice. With scale and a focus on innovation,
   our practice has had the opportunity to be an early adopter of AI
   technology. We have gained experience identifying use cases that provide
   value for our patients and practice; selecting AI products and vendors;
   piloting vendors' AI algorithms; creating our own AI algorithms;
   implementing, optimizing, and maintaining these algorithms; garnering
   radiologist acceptance of these tools; and integrating AI into our
   radiologists' daily workflow. With this experience, our practice has
   both managed challenges and identified unexpected benefits of AI. To
   ensure a successful and scalable AI implementation, multiple steps are
   required, including preparing the data, systems, and radiologists. This

Abstract = {With the development of economic globalization, the competition between
   companies is increasing and becoming a norm. As one of the main
   value-added tools, financial management has greatly improved its
   position in business management. Traditional financial management is
   difficult to keep up with the pace of modern company management, which
   to a large extent hinders the effective development of enterprises.
   Therefore, under the current macroeconomic background, the necessity of
   studying financial management innovation has become more urgent. In this
   context, seeking innovation is not only a problem for enterprises, but
   also an important strategic goal of economic development and the concept
   of national modern enterprise development. Many studies have been
   carried out in the field of technological innovation, and few have
   focused on innovation in financial management. Exploratory research on
   the factors that affect the choice of financial management mode and
   route planning is important both in reality and in theory. It can help
   enterprises to gain greater competitive advantage through innovative
   financial management and improve their operating efficiency and
   production quality. This paper is based on learning. A research on the
   innovation of enterprise financial management is carried out on machine
   and artificial intelligence technology.},

   learning resource query system and establish the relevant feedback
   mechanism of retrieval. This article applies this mechanism to the
   retrieval of learning resources, so as to provide learners with the
   learning resources they really need and improve learners' learning
   efficiency. This article proposes to find the relevant knowledge points
   by extracting the knowledge points of the retrieval content. It realizes
   the query expansion based on knowledge and then realizes the expansion
   of retrieval results. It realizes the mapping of knowledge points on the
   retrieval content, the query and expansion of knowledge points, and the
   presentation of learning resources of the knowledge point index. It also
   uses the relevant feedback mechanism to adjust the retrieval results to
   meet the retrieval needs of learners. The experimental results show that
   the number of knowledge points can be increased to 2-4 times by query
   expansion based on English resources. Thus, the number of learning
   resources of search results can be increased to 3-10 times, the
   expansion of search results can be realized, and the overall recall will
   be greatly improved. In this article, the related methods of artificial
   intelligence are applied to the construction experiment of the English
   learning resource query system, which has a certain promotion effect on
   the construction of the system.},

Abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It
   exhibits, at the mesoscopic scale, phenotypic characteristics that are
   generally indiscernible to the human eye but can be captured
   non-invasively on medical imaging as radiomic features, which can form a
   high dimensional data space amenable to machine learning. Radiomic
   features can be harnessed and used in an artificial intelligence
   paradigm to risk stratify patients, and predict for histological and
   molecular findings, and clinical outcome measures, thereby facilitating
   precision medicine for improving patient care. Compared to tissue
   sampling-driven approaches, radiomics-based methods are superior for
   being non-invasive, reproducible, cheaper, and less susceptible to
   intra-tumoral het-erogeneity. This review focuses on the application of
   radiomics, combined with artificial intelligence, for delivering
   precision medicine in lung cancer treatment, with discussion centered on
   pioneering and ground-breaking works, and future research directions in
   the area.},

Title = {Challenges and Future Directions of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence
   in Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Month = {OCT 19},
Abstract = {We discuss the new challenges and directions facing the use of big data
   and artificial intelligence (AI) in education research, policy-making,
   and industry. In recent years, applications of big data and AI in
   education have made significant headways. This highlights a novel trend
   in leading-edge educational research. The convenience and embeddedness
   of data collection within educational technologies, paired with
   computational techniques have made the analyses of big data a reality.
   We are moving beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and applications of
   techniques, and are beginning to see substantial adoption in many areas
   of education. The key research trends in the domains of big data and AI
   are associated with assessment, individualized learning, and precision
   education. Model-driven data analytics approaches will grow quickly to
   guide the development, interpretation, and validation of the algorithms.
   However, conclusions from educational analytics should, of course, be
   applied with caution. At the education policy level, the government
   should be devoted to supporting lifelong learning, offering teacher
   education programs, and protecting personal data. With regard to the
   education industry, reciprocal and mutually beneficial relationships
   should be developed in order to enhance academia-industry collaboration.
   Furthermore, it is important to make sure that technologies are guided
   by relevant theoretical frameworks and are empirically tested. Lastly,
   in this paper we advocate an in-depth dialog between supporters of
   ``cold{''} technology and ``warm{''} humanity so that it can lead to
   greater understanding among teachers and students about how technology,
   and specifically, the big data explosion and AI revolution can bring new
   opportunities (and challenges) that can be best leveraged for
   pedagogical practices and learning.},

Journal = {ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {131},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background and objective: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is
   a life-threatening pulmonary disease with a high clinical and cost
   burden across the globe. Artificial intelligence (AI), an emerging area,
   has been used for various purposes in ARDS. We aim to summarize the
   currently available literature on various applications of AI in ARDS
   through a systematic review. Methodology: PubMed was searched from
   inception to February 2021 to collate all the studies. Additionally, a
   bibliographic search of included studies and a random search on Google,
   Google Scholar, and Research Gate were performed to identify relevant
   articles. Studies published in English language that employed data about
   devel-oping and/or assessing the role of AI in the various aspects of
   ARDS were considered for this review. Three independent reviewers
   performed study selection and data extraction; any disagreements were
   settled through consensus or discussion with another member of the
   research team. Results: A total of 19 studies published between the year
   2002 and 2020 were included. In these included studies, AI was used for
   various purposes in ARDS such as diagnosis (n = 10; 53 \%), risk
   stratification (n = 1; 5 \%), prediction of severity (n = 3; 17 \%),
   management (n = 2; 10 \%), prediction of mortality (n = 2; 10 \%), and
   decision making (n = 1; 5 \%). The area under the curve among the
   developed models in the included studies ranged between 0.8 and 1, which
   is considered to be very good to excellent. Conclusion: AI is
   revolutionizing healthcare and has a wide range of applications in ARDS,
   such as minimizing cost and enhancing outcomes.},

Abstract = {The enrollment expansion of colleges and universities and the
   acceleration of today's social process bring fierce competition to
   students. Colleges and universities should attach great importance to
   the mental health and employment anxiety of graduate students. In order
   to better explore the relationship between them, this paper uses
   artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate students' psychology. The
   results show that: (1) When the crossover probability P value is less
   than 1, the psychology tends to be stable, and the emotion simulation
   conforms to the law of emotion change. (2) The accuracy of this model is
   higher than 82\%, and the weighted fuzzy reasoning method can
   effectively analyze psychological symptoms. (3) After iteration, CNN has
   different recognition degrees for six emotions. (4) Finally, according
   to the emotional analysis given by the model, the source of students'
   psychological problems is discussed, and it is found that these students
   have different degrees of bad academic behavior; while they are anxious
   about employment, the employment rate is not satisfactory.},

   steps to improve their cybersecurity systems. This review aims to
   introduce cybersecurity concepts as it relates to medical imaging and to
   provide background information on general and healthcare-specific
   cybersecurity challenges. We discuss approaches to enhancing the level
   and effectiveness of security through detection and prevention
   techniques, as well as ways that technology can improve security while
   mitigating risks. We first review general cybersecurity concepts and
   regulatory issues before examining these topics in the context of
   radiology AI, with a specific focus on data, training, data, training,
   implementation, and auditability. Finally, we suggest potential risk
   mitigation strategies. By reading this review, healthcare providers,
   researchers, and device developers can gain a better understanding of
   the potential risks associated with radiology AI projects, as well as
   strategies to improve cybersecurity and reduce potential associated
   risks.

Abstract = {The ongoing datafication of our social reality has resulted in the
   emergence of new data-based business models. This development is also
   reflected in the education market. An increasing number of educational
   technology (EdTech) companies are entering the traditional education
   market with data-based teaching and learning solutions, and they are
   permanently transforming the market. However, despite the current market
   dynamics, there are hardly any business models that implement the
   possibilities of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) to create adaptive teaching and learning paths. This paper focuses
   on EdTech companies and the drivers and barriers that currently affect
   data-based teaching and learning paths. The results show that LA
   especially are integrated into the current business models of EdTech
   companies on three levels, which are as follows: basic Learning
   Analytics, Learning Analytics and algorithmic or human-based
   recommendations, and Learning Analytics and adaptive teaching and
   learning (AI based). The discourse analysis reveals a diametrical
   relationship between the traditional educational ideal and the
   futuristic idea of education and knowledge transfer. While the desire
   for flexibility and individualization drives the debate on AI-based
   learning systems, a lack of data sovereignty, uncertainty and a lack of
   understanding of data are holding back the development and
   implementation of appropriate solutions at the same time.},

Abstract = {Employee turnover (ET) is a major issue faced by firms in all business
   sectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning (ML) prediction
   models can help to classify the likelihood of employees voluntarily
   departing from employment using historical employee datasets. However,
   output responses generated by these AI-based ML models lack transparency
   and interpretability, making it difficult for HR managers to understand
   the rationale behind the AI predictions. If managers do not understand
   how and why responses are generated by AI models based on the input
   datasets, it is unlikely to augment data-driven decision-making and
   bring value to the organisations. The main purpose of this article is to
   demonstrate the capability of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
   Explanations (LIME) technique to intuitively explain the ET predictions
   generated by AI-based ML models for a given employee dataset to HR
   managers. From a theoretical perspective, we contribute to the
   International Human Resource Management literature by presenting a
   conceptual review of AI algorithmic transparency and then discussing its
   significance to sustain competitive advantage by using the principles of
   resource-based view theory. We also offer a transparent AI
   implementation framework using LIME which will provide a useful guide
   for HR managers to increase the explainability of the AI-based ML
   models, and therefore mitigate trust issues in data-driven
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {There is a vast development of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent
   years. Computational technology, digitized data collection and enormous
   advancement in this field have allowed AI applications to penetrate the
   core human area of specialization. In this review article, we describe
   current progress achieved in the AI field highlighting constraints on
   smooth development in the field of medical AI sector, with discussion of
   its implementation in healthcare from a commercial, regulatory and
   sociological standpoint. Utilizing sizable multidimensional biological
   datasets that contain individual heterogeneity in genomes, functionality
   and milieu, precision medicine strives to create and optimize approaches
   for diagnosis, treatment methods and assessment. With the arise of
   complexity and expansion of data in the health-care industry, AI can be
   applied more frequently. The main application categories include
   indications for diagnosis and therapy, patient involvement and
   commitment and administrative tasks. There has recently been a sharp
   rise in interest in medical AI applications due to developments in AI
   software and technology, particularly in deep learning algorithms and in
   artificial neural network (ANN). In this overview, we enlisted the major
   categories of issues that AI systems are ideally equipped to resolve
   followed by clinical diagnostic tasks. It also includes a discussion of
   the future potential of AI, particularly for risk prediction in complex
   diseases, and the difficulties, constraints and biases that must be
   meticulously addressed for the effective delivery of AI in the

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) can be integrated
   within standard clinical software to facilitate the acceptance of the
   diagnostic findings during clinical interpretation.
   OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop and evaluate a novel, general
   purpose, explainable deep learning model (coronary artery disease-deep
   learning {[}CAD-DL]) for the detection of obstructive CAD following
   single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion
   imaging (MPI).
   METHODS: A total of 3,578 patients with suspected CAD undergoing SPECT
   MPI and invasive coronary angiography within a 6-month interval from 9
   centers were studied. CAD-DL computes the probability of obstructive CAD
   from stress myocardial perfusion, wall motion, and wall thickening maps,
   as well as left ventricular volumes, age, and sex. Myocardial regions
   contributing to the CAD-DL prediction are highlighted to explain the
   findings to the physician. A clinical prototype was integrated using a
   standard clinical workstation. Diagnostic performance by CAD-DL was
   compared to automated quantitative total perfusion deficit (TPD) and
   reader diagnosis.
   RESULTS: In total, 2,247 patients (63\%) had obstructive CAD. In 10-fold
   repeated testing, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
   curve (AUC) (95\% CI) was higher according to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.83 {[}95\%
   CI: 0.82-0.85]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.78 {[}95\% CI: 0.77-0.80]) or
   reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.71 {[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.72]; P < 0.0001 for
   both). In external testing, the AUC in 555 patients was higher according
   to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.80 {[}95\% CI: 0.76-0.84]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.73
   {[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.77]) or reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.65 {[}95\% CI:
   0.61-0.69]; P < 0.001 for all). The present model can be integrated
   within standard clinical software and generates results rapidly (<12
   seconds on a standard clinical workstation) and therefore could readily
   be incorporated into a typical clinical workflow.
   CONCLUSIONS: The deep-learning model significantly surpasses the
   diagnostic accuracy of standard quantitative analysis and clinical
   visual reading for MPI. Explainable artificial intelligence can be
   integrated within standard clinical software to facilitate acceptance of
   artificial intelligence diagnosis of CAD following MPI. (C) 2022 by the

Abstract = {Smart manufacturing is critical in improving the quality of the process
   industry. In smart manufacturing, there is a trend to incorporate
   different kinds of new-generation information technologies into
   process-safety analysis. At present, green manufacturing is facing major
   obstacles related to safety management, due to the usage of large
   amounts of hazardous chemicals, resulting in spatial inhomogeneity of
   chemical industrial processes and increasingly stringent safety and
   environmental regulations. Emerging information technologies such as
   artificial intelligence (AI) are quite promising as a means of
   overcoming these difficulties. Based on state-of-the-art AI methods and
   the complex safety relations in the process industry, we identify and
   discuss several technical challenges associated with process safety: (1)
   knowledge acquisition with scarce labels for process safety; (2)
   knowledge-based reasoning for process safety; (3) accurate fusion of
   heterogeneous data from various sources; and (4) effective learning for
   dynamic risk assessment and aided decision-making. Current and future
   works are also discussed in this context. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

Title = {Systematic Review of Radiology Residency Artificial Intelligence
   Curricula: Preparing Future Radiologists for the Artificial Intelligence
   Era},

Abstract = {Objective: Although educating radiology trainees about artificial
   intelligence (AI) has become increasingly emphasized, the types of AI
   educational curricula are not well understood. We performed a systematic
   review of original studies describing curricula used to teach AI
   concepts and practical applications for radiology residents and fellows.
   Materials and methods: We performed a PubMed search for original studies
   published as of July 22, 2022, describing AI curricula geared toward
   radiology residents or fellows. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were
   evaluated for curricula design, implementation details, and outcomes.
   Descriptive statistics were used to summarize these curricula. Results:
   Five studies were included describing an AI curriculum, all geared
   toward radiology residents. All five curricula were led by radiologists,
   mostly by individual academic radiology departments (4; 80\%) with one
   led by the ACR Resident and Fellow Section. Curricula design included
   didactic sessions (5; 100\%), assigned readings (4; 80\%), hands-on
   learning (3; 60\%), and journal clubs (3; 60\%); only one had
   individualized learning plans. All four studies that evaluated the
   impact of the curricula on participants' knowledge or attitudes showed
   positive effects. Discussion: Amid increasing recognition of the
   importance of AI education for radiologists-in-training, several AI
   curricula for radiology residents have been implemented. Although
   curricula designs varied and it is unclear if one type is superior, they
   have had a positive impact on residents' knowledge and attitudes toward
   AI. As AI becomes increasingly adopted in radiology, these curricula
   serve as models for other departments and programs to develop AI
   educational initiatives to prepare the next generation of radiologists
   for the AI era.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developing rapidly in recent years
   in terms of software algorithms, hardware implementation, and
   applications in a vast number of areas. In this review, we summarize the
   latest developments of applications of AI in biomedicine, including
   disease diagnostics, living assistance, biomedical information
   processing, and biomedical research. The aim of this review is to keep
   track of new scientific accomplishments, to understand the availability
   of technologies, to appreciate the tremendous potential of AI in
   biomedicine, and to provide researchers in related fields with
   inspiration. It can be asserted that, just like AI itself, the
   application of AI in biomedicine is still in its early stage. New
   progress and breakthroughs will continue to push the frontier and widen
   the scope of AI application, and fast developments are envisioned in the
   near future. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the prediction

Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},

Abstract = {The ever-looming water pollution has caused waterborne diseases,
   destruction of biodiversity, and unsafe potable water, resulting in
   millions of deaths every year. Although mounting efforts were exerted to
   tackle these serious issues, one cannot solve all the problems by
   manpower alone, not to mention studies that require long period
   monitoring on water quality (e.g., eutrophication). Therefore, it is of
   vital need to develop new approaches which are more intelligent,
   convenient, and less hazardous to perform. Computer science and
   engineering, which has gained rapid advancement in recent years, has
   been widely applied in many other fundamental disciplines such as
   aquatic chemistry research. For example, computational chemistry, which
   uses first-principles or empirical methods, has been extensively applied
   to predict transformation behaviors of pollutants in natural and
   engineered water systems. Additionally, remarkable advancements of
   artificial intelligence, including its subset machine learning, have
   become major problem-solving techniques in this area. In this context,
   we summarize primary applications of computational chemistry, artificial
   intelligence, and machine learning in aquatic chemistry research.
   Meanwhile, challenges along the development process were brought out to
   inspire greater efforts. We aimed to provide possibilities for better
   understanding on aquatic chemistry from a distinctive perspective,
   appealing to scientists and engineers to develop advanced solutions for
   water pollution.},

Month = {DEC 27},
Abstract = {Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has led to serious
   health-related complications worldwide. NAFLD has wide pathological
   spectra, ranging from simple steatosis to hepatitis to cirrhosis and
   hepatocellular carcinoma. Artificial intelligence (AI), including
   machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has provided great
   advancement and accuracy in identifying, diagnosing, and managing
   patients with NAFLD and detecting squeal such as advanced fibrosis and
   risk factors for hepatocellular cancer. This review summarizes different
   AI algorithms and methods in the field of hepatology, focusing on NAFLD.
   Methods: A search of PubMed, WILEY, and MEDLINE databases were taken as
   relevant publications for this review on the application of AI
   techniques in detecting NAFLD in suspected population Results: Out of
   495 articles searched in relevant databases, 49 articles were finally
   included and analyzed. NASH-Scope model accurately distinguished between
   NAFLD and non-NAFLD and between NAFLD without fibrosis and NASH with
   fibrosis. The logistic regression (LR) model had the highest accuracy,
   whereas the support vector machine (SVM) had the highest specificity and
   precision in diagnosing NAFLD. An extreme gradient boosting model had
   the highest performance in predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
   (NASH). Electronic health record (EHR) database studies helped the
   diagnose NAFLD/NASH. Automated image analysis techniques predicted NAFLD
   severity. Deep learning radiomic elastography (DLRE) had perfect
   accuracy in diagnosing the cases of advanced fibrosis. Conclusion: AI in
   NAFLD has streamlined specific patient identification and has eased
   assessment and management methods of patients with NAFLD.},

Abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th
   century but has been rapidly accel-erating in the past decade.
   Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years,
   this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular
   medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there
   are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in
   progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the
   prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of
   the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level
   medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce.
   However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI
   must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used
   inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is
   important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling
   AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows
   how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a
   brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want
   to develop their own AI. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Journal = {E-MENTOR},

Abstract = {The application of computer-based technologies in academic education has
   at least three decades of history and experience. In some study fields,
   it has been present since the very beginning, while in others it has
   become a necessity only in recent years. The ongoing technological
   revolution is disrupting the traditional professions with fundamental
   changes and - in some cases - even with the threat of disappearance of
   jobs. The finance and accounting professions are expected to undergo a
   technological change in the near future. While the changes are visible
   at the corporate level, university education seems to lag one step
   behind. We conducted a study among the students and graduates of the
   finance and accounting line of studies at the Cracow University of
   Economics. Using regression analysis, we investigate the perception of
   the usefulness of courses providing knowledge on new technologies like
   Artificial Intelligence (AI). We use a unique Polish setting, which is a
   leader in terms of outsourcing services. Our findings show that both
   students and graduates are aware of the importance of technological
   change. The courses teaching basic subjects are essential, but the
   current expectations are much higher in terms of the application of new
   technology based on AI in finance and accounting.},

Abstract = {The majority of the universities and private institutions have initiated
   the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine translation (MT) in
   teaching translation. Translators have been trained by a systematic
   teaching method with newly designed curriculum with the addition of
   computer-assisted technology. However, the learner's face-to-face
   experience is relating them to advance self-learning of languages
   through AI machine, which lack the motivational mechanism. This review
   paper presents the recent advancement in the use of AI and MT in the
   teaching translations to translators. The aim of the study is to
   investigate the pedagogical implications of AI for teaching translation
   studies. The study concludes that there is lack of critical reflection
   of challenges and jeopardies of AI in translation teaching, there is a
   weak connection to academic instructive perceptions, and that there is a
   need for further exploration of principled and enlightening approaches
   in the application of AI in translation teaching in higher education.},

Title = {The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Diagnostic Radiology: A Survey at
   a Single Radiology Residency Training Program},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Pages = {1753-1757},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose: Advances in artificial intelligence applied to diagnostic
   radiology are predicted to have a major impact on this medical
   specialty. With the goal of establishing a baseline upon which to build
   educational activities on this topic, a survey was conducted among
   trainees and attending radiologists at a single residency program.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed. Comparisons of
   categorical data between groups (trainees and attending radiologists)
   were made using Pearson chi(2) analysis or an exact analysis when
   required. Comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when
   the data were not normally distributed. An alpha level of 0.05 was used.
   Results: The overall response rate was 66\% (69 of 104). Thirty-six
   percent of participants (n = 25) reported not having read a scientific
   medical article on the topic of artificial intelligence during the past
   12 months. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (n = 12) reported using
   artificial intelligence tools during their daily work. Trainees were
   more likely to express doubts on whether they would have pursued
   diagnostic radiology as a career had they known of the potential impact
   artificial intelligence is predicted to have on the specialty (P =
   .0254) and were also more likely to plan to learn about the topic (P =
   .0401).
   Conclusions: Radiologists lack exposure to current scientific medical
   articles on artificial intelligence. Trainees are concerned by the
   implications artificial intelligence may have on their jobs and desire
   to learn about the topic. There is a need to develop educational
   resources to help radiologists assume an active role in guiding and
   facilitating the development and implementation of artificial
   intelligence tools in diagnostic radiology.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {IntroductionAs the global climate crisis worsens, carbon neutrality has
   attracted the attention of various nations. MethodsBased on panel data
   from 282 Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2008 to 2019, this
   research considers the execution of the artificial intelligence strategy
   as a quasi-natural experiment. It uses the difference-in-differences
   (DID) model to evaluate the effect of artificial intelligence
   construction on carbon emission reduction. ResultsThe findings indicate
   that implementing the artificial intelligence strategy into practice can
   lower carbon emissions and advance carbon neutrality, and this
   conclusion still passes after various robustness tests. The mediating
   effects reveal that developing green technologies and upgrading the
   industrial structure are crucial mechanisms for achieving carbon
   neutrality. The implementation effect varies with time, geographical
   location, natural resource endowment, and city level. DiscussionThis
   article examines the influence of artificial intelligence on urban
   carbon neutrality at the city level, adding to the notion of urban
   carbon neutrality and providing research support for urban development

Abstract = {This research examines how artificial intelligence may contribute to
   better understanding and to overcome overindebtedness in contexts of
   high poverty risk. This research uses Automated Machine Learning
   (AutoML) in a field database of 1654 over-indebted households to
   identify distinguishable clusters and to predict its risk factors.
   First, unsupervised machine learning using Self-Organizing Maps
   generated three over-indebtedness clusters: low-income (31.27\%), low
   credit control (37.40\%), and crisis-affected households (31.33\%).
   Second, supervised machine learning with exhaustive grid search
   hyperparameters (32,730 predictive models) suggests that NuSupport
   Vector Machine had the best accuracy in predicting families'
   over-indebtedness risk factors (89.5\%). By proposing an AutoML approach
   on over-indebtedness, our research adds both theoretically and
   methodologically to current models of scarcity with important practical
   implications for business research and society. Our findings also
   contribute to novel ways to identify and characterize poverty risk in
   earlier stages, allowing customized interventions for different profiles
   of over-indebtedness.},

Abstract = {The current stage of society development is very closely related to the
   digitalization of all spheres of public life without exception.
   Education in this regard should become the starting point or the basis

   based on AI, as well as robots and robotics objects. Digitalization in
   education is promoted by economic, social and structural prerequisites.
   The introduction of these technologies provides new opportunities to
   improve the educational process, but at the same time the application of
   these technologies faces some risks, the identification of negative
   consequences of which is delayed. The aim of the article is to provide
   the ways for the development of legal regulation of AI, robots and
   robotics objects in education. The study considers the experience of
   different countries in the implementation of AI technologies in the
   educational process, provides the opinions of international UNESCO
   experts, Russian and foreign researchers. According to the results of
   the research, three main directions of the relationship between the
   development of AI technologies and education are identified: 1) training

Month = {2021 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely
   used in the field of education, and artificial intelligence in education
   (AIEd) has gained increasing attention. However, no quantitative
   meta-analysis has been conducted on the overall effectiveness of AI on
   learning achievement and learning perception. To close this research
   gap, this study conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of the effects
   of AI on learning achievement and learning perception. The present
   meta-analysis synthesized 24 articles with a total of 2908 participants
   from 2001 to 2020. The findings reveal that AI had a high effect size on
   learning achievement and a small effect size on learning perception. The
   effect sizes of 13 moderator variables were analyzed, including sample
   levels, sample size, learning domains, learning methods, research
   design, research settings, intervention duration, types of organization
   for treatment, role of AI, areas of AI application, AI software, AI
   hardware, and AI technologies. It was found that sample size, sample
   level, learning domains, types of organization, roles of AI, and
   hardware significantly moderated the effectiveness of AI. The results
   and the implications for educators and practitioners are discussed in

   propose a simulation model which can dynamically analyze the role of
   students in education management services. Our simulation results are in
   good agreement with the actual results, and we propose an improved
   scheme based on the experimental results. With the development of
   science and technology, artificial intelligence technology is also in
   continuous progress, now all fields of talent at all levels are studying
   artificial intelligence technology, and have different views on it. From
   the current trend, we can see that in the future, artificial

   life. At the same time, artificial intelligence technology can also be
   applied in the education industry. The combination of human intelligence
   technology and education management technology makes the management of
   education more leisurely and active, and can promote the development of

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {The objective of the study is to explore an effective way for providing
   students with the appropriate learning resources in the remote education
   scenario. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and educational
   psychology theory are applied for designing a personalized online
   learning resource recommendation scheme to improve students' learning
   outcomes. First, according to educational psychology, students' learning
   ability can be obtained by analyzing their learning behaviors. Their
   identities can be classified into three main groups. Then, features of
   learning resources such as difficulty degree are extracted, and a
   LinUCB-based learning resource recommendation algorithm is proposed. In
   this algorithm, a personalized exploration coefficient is carefully
   constructed according to student's ability and attention scores. It can
   adaptively adjust the ratio of exploration and exploitation during
   recommendation. Finally, experiments are conducted for evaluating the
   superior performance of the proposed scheme. The experimental results
   show that the proposed recommendation scheme can find appropriate
   learning resources which will match the student's ability and satisfy
   the student's personalized demands. Meanwhile, by comparing with
   existing state-of-the-art recommendation schemes, the proposed scheme
   can achieve accurate recommendations, so as to provide students with the
   most suitable online learning resources and reduce the risk brought by
   exploration. Therefore, the proposed scheme can not only control the
   difficulty degree of learning resources within the student's ability but
   also encourage their potential by providing suitable learning resources.},

   Assisted Triaging for Endotracheal Tube Position on Chest X-ray},
Journal = {DIAGNOSTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) provide a vital connection between the
   ventilator and patient; however, improper placement can hinder
   ventilation efficiency or injure the patient. Chest X-ray (CXR) is the
   most common approach to confirming ETT placement; however, technicians
   require considerable expertise in the interpretation of CXRs, and formal
   reports are often delayed. In this study, we developed an artificial
   intelligence-based triage system to enable the automated assessment of
   ETT placement in CXRs. Three intensivists performed a review of 4293
   CXRs obtained from 2568 ICU patients. The CXRs were labeled ``CORRECT ``
   or ``INCORRECT `` in accordance with ETT placement. A region of interest
   (ROI) was also cropped out, including the bilateral head of the
   clavicle, the carina, and the tip of the ETT. Transfer learning was used
   to train four pre-trained models (VGG16, INCEPTION\_V3, RESNET, and
   DENSENET169) and two models developed in the current study
   (VGG16\_Tensor Projection Layer and CNN\_Tensor Projection Layer) with
   the aim of differentiating the placement of ETTs. Only VGG16 based on
   ROI images presented acceptable performance (AUROC = 92\%, F1 score =
   0.87). The results obtained in this study demonstrate the feasibility of
   using the transfer learning method in the development of AI models by
   which to assess the placement of ETTs in CXRs.},

Abstract = {Based on MPP database, we have conducted research and investigation on
   big data processing and analysis, and provided a good solution for big
   data. However, due to the large data storage requirements in the local
   file system may not be fully met. Therefore, the storage and management
   of big data, reliability, availability and scalability are more and more
   adopted by distributed file system. Therefore, MPP database based on
   distributed file system has become a research hotspot. In this paper, in
   the network control, through the control algorithm based on two kinds of
   artificial intelligence system, through the fuzzy PID controller to
   reduce the impact of system control performance. The dynamic BP network
   error correction and predictive PID controller are intro-duced into the

   accurate online evaluation and analysis of College Students' mental
   health can provide reference for college students and effective help for
   the follow-up activities and consultation of the school, At the same
   time, it provides some basis for the balance of psychological scale and
   the revision of item setting. In this paper, MPP database and artificial
   intelligence system are introduced into the application of mental health
   assessment, which can effectively assess the mental health of college
   students, and thus promote the continuous development of assessment
   application.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and Fifth-Generation (5G) communication networks
   are examples of new information technologies that have aided and
   facilitated educational reform and progress. Built on the convincing
   requirements of college English education, with the advantage of
   artificial intelligence technology, we can enhance the teaching mode
   effectiveness, cultivate students' critical thinking ability, implement
   personalized wisdom and interactive learning, and thus realize
   artificial intelligence, and the effective use of 5G in English
   education is becoming a research hotspot area to be addressed. It is
   necessary to create a teaching aid system that uses a high-speed network
   and new type of technology. The specific techniques and measures for
   introducing 5G technology and artificial intelligence into higher
   education and English learning are discussed in this study. Students in
   higher education can benefit from the proposed technique by obtaining a
   better understanding of the subject and promoting their critical
   thinking skills. Finally, an experiment is performed to see how
   operative this technique is at teaching English when compared to
   traditional methods. The results are analyzed to determine that using
   this method is effective and boosts students' interest in learning as
   well as their hands-on abilities.},

Abstract = {This article aims to analyze and reflect on: (a) the role that
   competencesas a defining component of work activity and occupation in
   the coming decades have in a hyper technological and globalized society;
   (b) the incorporation that is taking place in Spain of Skills-Based
   Training in Higher Education (both in professional training and in
   university studies); and (c) the conditioning factors and challenges
   that Higher Education faces in the immediate future in relation to
   competences. The technological factor from robotization to artificial
   intelligence together with demographic, social, and economic factors
   confirm the importance of cross-sectional competences in the careers of
   the future. Faced with this demand, it can be seen that the Higher
   Education is currently in the process of adopting competences as the
   axis of training. While the curricula have already been defined on the
   basis of competences, an advancement in methodological change is still
   required (through active methodologies), as well as in evaluation
   (considering learning results) so that the insertion of competences in
   Professional Training and in the university is complete.},

   Higher Education for Students With Specific Learning Difficulties: A
   Review},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {64907-64927},
Abstract = {The development of new technologies and their expanding use in a wide
   range of educational environments are driving the transformation of
   higher education. Assistive technologies are cutting-edge technologies
   that can help students learn more effectively and make education
   accessible to everyone. Assistive technologies can enhance, maintain, or
   improve the capacities of students with learning difficulties. Students
   with learning difficulties will be greatly benefited from the use of
   assistive technologies. If these technologies are used effectively,
   students with learning difficulties can compete with their peers and
   complete their academic tasks. The aim of this review is to better
   understand the role of assistive technologies in providing inclusive
   higher education for students with learning difficulties. The review
   begins with the introduction of learning difficulties and their causes;
   inclusive education and the need for assistive technologies; the
   motivation behind this review; and a summary of related reviews on
   assistive technologies for students with learning difficulties in
   inclusive higher education. Then, we discuss the preliminaries of the
   types of learning difficulties and assistive technologies. Later, we
   discuss the effects of assistive technologies on inclusive higher
   education for students with learning difficulties. Additionally, we
   discuss supporting tools and related projects available in inclusive
   higher education for students with learning difficulties. We also
   explore the challenges and potential solutions related to using
   assistive technologies in higher education to provide inclusive
   education for students with learning difficulties. We conclude the
   review with a discussion on promising future directions.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {7},
Pages = {8691-8713},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support self-regulated
   learning (SRL) because of its strong anthropomorphic characteristics.
   However, most studies of AI in education have focused on cognitive
   outcomes in higher education, and little research has examined how
   psychological needs affect SRL with AI in the K-12 setting. SRL is a
   self-directed process driven by psychological factors that can be
   explained by the three basic needs of self-determination theory (SDT),
   i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study fills a research
   gap by examining the moderating effects of need satisfaction and gender
   in predicting SRL among Grade 9 students. The results indicate that
   girls perceive more need support than boys. In predicting SRL,
   satisfaction of the need for autonomy and competence is moderated by
   both gender and AI knowledge, whereas satisfaction of the need for
   relatedness is moderated by gender only. Particularly among girls, the
   effects of autonomy and competence more strongly predict SRL when AI
   knowledge is low. These findings confirm the gender differences in need
   satisfaction when predicting SRL with a chatbot. The findings have
   implications for both teacher instruction and the design and development
   of intelligent learning environments.},

Abstract = {Human factors analysis (HFA) has been explored from various aspects
   (e.g., engineering, psychology, physiology, and ergonomics). Numerous

   intelligence-driven systems reveal these methods' incapability. This
   necessity is developing intelligent approaches that account for
   integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into human factors. This work
   reviewed the integration of artificial intelligence and expert systems
   into HFA. It primarily focused on using machine and deep learning and
   knowledge/data-driven modeling approaches to HFA. Accordingly, this
   systematic review investigated the applications, contributions,
   challenges, and research gaps of HFA in complex systems. We analyzed
   seven vital elements of HFA to illustrate these concerns. This work also
   highlighted important myths, misapplications, and critical concerns that

   performed a pairwise comparison between AI and ML positions. Overall, it
   was observed that technical skills like data mining, programming,
   statistics and big data are more valued for ML positions than for AI
   positions. On the contrary, AI positions tend to be more generic, with
   an emphasis on communication skills. These clearly defined skills can be
   valuable for the hiring process as well as to revamp existing course
   curricula to cater to the increasing market demand.},

Abstract = {Intelligent learning platforms and education information application
   platforms are gaining ground, owing to the wide application of modern
   technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data analysis,
   artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. However, the current
   platforms cannot solve specific teaching problems, and the relevant
   research mostly focuses on primary and secondary education. Therefore,
   this paper constructs and analyzes a framework of intelligent education
   system for higher education based on the deep learning. Firstly, the
   functional block diagram of the system was built up. Next, a face
   detection algorithm was proposed based on the multi-task convolutional
   neural network, a face recognition algorithm was developed based on the
   improved deep convolutional neural network, and the knowledge learning
   status of students was tracked based on the memory augmented neural
   network. Finally, the proposed framework was proved effective and swift
   through experiments. The research results expand the application scope
   of the deep learning in education.},

Abstract = {The global higher education sector has been significantly disrupted by
   the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools such as
   ChatGPT, especially in relation to its implications for assessment.
   However, few studies to date have explored student perspectives on these
   tools. This article reports on one of the first large-scale quantitative
   studies of student views on generative artificial intelligence at an
   Australian university (n = 1,135). When the survey was conducted, most
   students had low knowledge, experience, and confidence in using these
   tools. These results varied across disciplines and across some student
   sub-groups, such as mature-age students and international students.
   Confidence appeared to increase with experience, although the data also
   revealed a portion of students that have never used these tools yet
   still felt confident in using them. In exploring these results, this
   article aims to shed new light on this fast-evolving landscape and
   inform the future direction of supporting students to engage with
   generative artificial intelligence tools appropriately.},

Title = {Modern Artificial Intelligence Model Development for Undergraduate
   Student Performance Prediction: An Investigation on Engineering
   Mathematics Courses},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {136697-136724},
Abstract = {A computationally efficient artificial intelligence (AI) model called
   Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) is adopted to analyze patterns embedded
   in continuous assessment to model the weighted score (WS) and the
   examination (EX) score in engineering mathematics courses at an
   Australian regional university. The student performance data taken over
   a six-year period in multiple courses ranging from the mid- to the
   advanced level and a diverse course offering mode (i.e., on-campus, ONC,
   and online, ONL) are modelled by ELM and further benchmarked against
   competing models: random forest (RF) and Volterra. With the assessments
   and examination marks as key predictors of WS (leading to a grade in the
   mid-level course), ELM (with respect to RF and Volterra) outperformed
   its counterpart models both for the ONC and the ONL offer. This
   generated relative prediction error in the testing phase, of only
   0.74\%, compared to about 3.12\% and 1.06\%, respectively, while for the
   ONL offer, the prediction errors were only 0.51\% compared to about
   3.05\% and 0.70\%. In modelling the student performance in advanced
   engineering mathematics course, ELM registered slightly larger errors:
   0.77\% (vs. 22.23\% and 1.87\%) for ONC and 0.54\% (vs. 4.08\% and
   1.31\%) for the ONL offer. This study advocates a pioneer implementation
   of a robust AI methodology to uncover relationships among student
   learning variables, developing teaching and learning intervention and
   course health checks to address issues related to graduate outcomes, and
   student learning attributes in the higher education sector.},

Volume = {6},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Cardiovascular conditions remain the leading cause of mortality and
   morbidity worldwide, with genotype being a significant influence on
   disease risk. Cardiac imaging-genetics aims to identify and characterize
   the genetic variants that influence functional, physiological, and
   anatomical phenotypes derived from cardiovascular imaging.
   High-throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping have greatly accelerated
   genetic discovery, making variant interpretation one of the key
   challenges in contemporary clinical genetics. Heterogeneous,
   low-fidelity phenotyping and difficulties integrating and then analyzing
   large-scale genetic, imaging and clinical datasets using traditional
   statistical approaches have impeded process. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) methods, such as deep learning, are particularly suited to tackle
   the challenges of scalability and high dimensionality of data and show
   promise in the field of cardiac imaging-genetics. Here we review the
   current state of AI as applied to imaging-genetics research and discuss
   outstanding methodological challenges, as the field moves from pilot
   studies to mainstream applications, from one dimensional global
   descriptors to high-resolution models of whole-organ shape and function,
   from univariate to multivariate analysis and from candidate gene to
   genome-wide approaches. Finally, we consider the future directions and
   prospects of AI imaging-genetics for ultimately helping understand the
   genetic and environmental underpinnings of cardiovascular health and

Abstract = {As education is an essential enabler in achieving Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), it should ``ensure inclusive, equitable
   quality education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for
   all{''}. One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of
   ``equitable quality education{''}. To attain and work in the context of
   SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is
   gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student
   performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has
   started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in
   education to create better learning. To provide better education, data
   analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid
   solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics
   tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information
   Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP).
   A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted
   the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of
   97.03\%, sensitivity value of 95.26\%, specificity value of 98.8\%,
   precision value of 98.86\%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of
   94\% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99\%. Hence, such a method is
   very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of
   allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the
   experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model
   satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for
   forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for
   students in virtual education systems.},

   through immediate feedback and teacher intervention), and assessment
   (e.g., through automated essay scoring) of their teaching. We also found
   that teachers have various roles in the development of AI technology.
   These roles include acting as models for training AI algorithms and
   participating in AI development by checking the accuracy of AI automated
   assessment systems. Our findings further underlined several challenges
   in AI implementation in teaching practice, which provide guidelines for

Abstract = {Recently, UAE has adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) and e-learning
   system in several fields including education. Together with the
   institutions running on conventional educational system, military
   colleges have also embrassed this new technology. This study assessed
   the current status of adoption, challenges and strategies of using AI
   based e-learning system in the UAE military based colleges. The study
   was carried out based on the perception of the teachers and students of
   Joint Command and Staff College (JCSC). A set of the questions was
   presented to the 50 teachers and 157 students for highlighting the level
   of agreement for each question. The questions were devided into three
   sections as level of adoption, challenges, and strategies in using AI
   based e-learning education system. The study found that for current
   status, AI and e-learning have got siginificant popularity in the
   education system due to high level of flexibility. While the challenges,
   the lack of human relations between teacher and student is reported as
   the major challenge faced in adoption of AI based e-learning system.
   Finally, for the strategies, the respondents indicated that the UAE is
   trying to develop plans and alternatives to address the discrepancy
   between traditional teaching and artificial intelligence methods adapted
   in the military college. This study provides a valuable source of
   information for devicing strategies to promote the uses of these modern
   tools and also motivate the students to get the maximum benefits of AI

Abstract = {Purpose Change is the operative word in higher education; as roles
   shift, classrooms are reinvented, and content becomes increasingly more
   accessible. At the core of these changes is the pervasiveness of
   learning technology. This papers aims to propose a model for the
   selection and adoption of emerging learning technologies to enhance
   learning within the context of higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach Higher education institutions are resorting
   to the deployment of learning technologies to address the demands of the
   twenty-first century learners and to ascertain their competitiveness.
   This paper draws from the literature to provide a model, composed of
   five key characteristics of learning, to support the selection and
   adoption of emerging learning technologies.
   Findings The model posits that the attainment of each of these five
   characteristics, personalised, ubiquitous, collaborative, lifelong and
   authentic needs to be supported by corresponding technologies: adaptive
   learning technologies, artificial intelligence, mobile technology,
   social technology, massive open online courses, virtual and augmented
   reality, gamification and the Internet of Things.
   Originality/value Higher education is progressively being displaced from
   the traditional classroom, and as it progresses towards online settings,
   it requires the support of technology to facilitate that transference.
   In examining the potential of future learning technologies, this paper
   contributes to a growing body of research that focuses on the benefits
   of technology within higher education and assists educators in the

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with
   roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory,
   neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The
   modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College
   in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning
   (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites,
   goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition,
   sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support
   systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life,
   AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic
   and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose
   technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity,
   electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the
   workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety
   and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML
   methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like
   sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent
   DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use
   of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and
   management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in
   strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift
   occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a
   proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for
   the future of work will help mitigate the unfavorable effects of AI on
   worker safety, health, and well-being.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging powerful novel technology
   that can model real-time problems involving numerous intricacies. The
   modeling capabilities of AI techniques are quite advantageous in water
   purification and wastewater treatment processes because the automation
   of such facilities resulted in easy and low cost operations; in addition
   to the significant reduction in the occurrence of human errors. AI
   technologies involve multi-linear or non-linear relationships and
   process dynamics that are usually impractical to model by con-ventional
   methodologies. This review presents a compendious synopsis of recent
   advancements and discoveries in various AI technologies applied to
   source water quality determination, coagulation/flocculation,
   disinfection, membrane filtration, desalination, modeling wastewater
   treatment plants, prediction of membrane fouling, removal of heavy
   metals, and monitoring of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) levels. The analysis of the performance of various
   AI technologies in this review proves the successful implementation of
   these technologies in water treatment related applications. It also
   highlights the limitations that hinder their implementations in
   real-world water treatment systems.},

   students' intentions to learn AI. The data were drawn from 494
   university students. In Study 1, the variable-centered approach of
   structural equation modeling showed the critical role of supportive
   environments and expectancy-value beliefs in promoting students'
   intentions to learn AI. In Study 2, the person-centered approach of
   latent profile analysis identified three subgroups of students based on
   their levels of supportive environments and expectancy-value beliefs.
   Consistent with Study 1, students who perceived more supportive
   environments and higher levels of expectancy-value beliefs had stronger
   intentions to learn AI. We also documented the influence of study of
   field, gender, and year level on students' perceptions of supportive
   environments, expectancy-value beliefs and intentions to learn AI. The
   implications of these findings in improving students' intentions to
   learn AI are discussed.},

Abstract = {Data science is likely to lead to major changes in cardiovascular
   imaging. Problems with timing, efficiency, and missed diagnoses occur at
   all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial
   intelligence (AI) is dependent on robust data; the application of
   appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its
   clinical application to image segmentation, automated measurements, and
   eventually, automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at
   the stages of image acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making.
   Moreover, the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging,
   combined with ``big data{''} from the electronic health record and
   pathology, is likely to better characterize disease and personalize
   therapy. This review summarizes recent promising applications of AI in
   cardiology and cardiac imaging, which potentially add value to patient

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence education will be an important part of
   information technology education in the future. It will enter the
   classroom and the learning life of students in various forms. The modern
   teaching media used in artificial intelligence courses at universities
   include some conventional teaching courseware, multimedia videos, and
   tool software. Some teaching media are unique to artificial
   intelligence, such as smart software, smart devices, and smart websites.
   The existing cross-cultural competence dimensions and evaluation scales
   were theoretically explained with factor analysis by comparing and
   selecting comprehensive evaluation methods in the work. Its main
   advantages were as follows: simple mathematical models and easy
   operation. The construction of a comprehensive evaluation model for
   college students' cross-cultural competence included the principles and
   ideas of model construction, the methods and steps of model
   construction, and model calculations. The survey results showed that the
   four-level scores of all samples had a significant positive correlation
   with foreign cultural knowledge, attitudes, and cross-cultural
   communication skills at 0.01 level (bilateral) and 0.05 (bilateral),

Abstract = {Today, corresponding to the new wave of internationalisation and

   Accordingly, detailed research is undertaken in the present study on
   innovative teaching strategies that can be developed, under the
   background of artificial intelligence, to familiarise college students
   with the ability to fluently express their ideas in English. The
   research shows that among the factors affecting the quality of English
   teaching, teachers' teaching methods, English teaching environment and
   students' independent learning ability account for high weightage, which
   are 54\%, 31\% and 11\%, respectively. Through the model of college
   students' English teaching innovation strategy, it can be seen that the
   teaching method, teaching environment and autonomous learning method are
   the most feasible methods that can be employed in crafting a students'

   Issues, Status, and Challenges},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {16907-16922},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a significant growth in demand response
   (DR) as a cost-effective technique of providing flexibility and, as a
   result, improving the dependability of energy systems. Although the
   tasks associated with demand side management (DSM) are extremely
   complex, the use of large-scale data and the frequent requirement for
   near-real-time decisions mean that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
   recently emerged as a key technology for enabling DSM. Optimization
   algorithm methods can be used to address a variety of problems,
   including selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond to, learning
   their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, device scheduling,
   and control, as well as determining the most effective way to incentive
   and reward participants in DR schemes fairly and effectively. The
   implementation optimization algorithm needs proper selection to mitigate
   the cost of energy consumption. Due to that reason, this paper outlines
   various challenges and opportunities in developing, utilizing,
   controlling, and scheduling the DR scheme's optimization algorithm. In
   addition, several issues in applications and advantages of optimization
   techniques in artificial intelligence approaches are discussed. The
   importance of implementing demand response mechanisms in developing
   countries is also presented. In addition, the status of demand response
   optimization in demand-side management solutions is also illustrated
   congruently.},

Title = {Assessment of learning curves on a simulated neurosurgical task using

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE Understanding the variation of learning curves of experts and
   trainees for a given surgical procedure is important in implementing
   formative learning paradigms to accelerate mastery. The study objectives
   were to use artificial intelligence (AI)-derived metrics to determine
   the learning curves of participants in 4 groups with different expertise
   levels who performed a series of identical virtual reality (VR) subpial
   resection tasks and to identify learning curve differences among the 4
   groups.
   METHODS A total of 50 individuals participated, 14 neurosurgeons, 4
   neurosurgical fellows and 10 senior residents (seniors), 10 junior
   residents (juniors), and 12 medical students. All participants performed
   5 repetitions of a subpial tumor resection on the NeuroVR (CAE
   Healthcare) platform, and 6 a priori-derived metrics selected using the
   K-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm were used to assess
   participant learning curves. Group learning curves were plotted over the
   5 trials for each metric. A mixed, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed
   between the first and fifth trial. For significant interactions (p <
   0.05), post hoc Tukey's HSD analysis was conducted to determine the
   location of the significance.
   RESULTS Overall, 5 of the 6 metrics assessed had a significant
   interaction (p < 0.05). The 4 groups, neurosurgeons, seniors, juniors,
   and medical students, showed an improvement between the first and fifth
   trial on at least one of the 6 metrics evaluated.
   CONCLUSIONS Learning curves generated using AI-derived metrics provided
   novel insights into technical skill acquisition, based on expertise
   level, during repeated VR-simulated subpial tumor resections, which will
   allow educators to develop more focused formative educational paradigms
   for neurosurgical trainees.},

Abstract = {Many radiologists are considering investments in artificial intelligence
   (AI) to improve the quality of care for our patients. This article
   outlines considerations for the purchasing process beginning with
   performance evaluation. Practices should decide whether there is a need
   to independently verify performance or accept vendor-provided data.
   Successful implementations will consider who will receive AI results,
   how results will be presented, and the impact on efficiency. The article
   provides education on infrastructure considerations including the
   benefits and drawbacks of best-of-breed and platform approaches in
   addition to highly specialized server requirements like graphical
   processing unit availability. Finally, the article presents financial
   and quality and safety considerations, some of which are unique to AI.
   Examples include whether additional revenue could be obtained, as in the
   case of mammography, and whether an AI model unintentionally leads to
   reinforcing healthcare disparities.},

Abstract = {Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential factors for the success of
   an organization. KPIs measure the current performance and identify the
   ongoing progress for specified business objectives. The Ministry of
   Higher Education (MoHE) in Palestine used established formulas to
   predict the KPI. These KPIs are vital for charting the organization
   aims. This study applies regression models for student enrollment data
   sets to predict accurate KPIs that can be used and adapted for any
   higher education system. The predictive engine will determine the KPI
   based on linear regression techniques such as Lasso, Elastic Net, and
   non-linear regression such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), and
   K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) in
   Palestine provided the datasets related to enrollments and graduations
   data for different Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The regression
   algorithms were evaluated by mean absolute error, mean square error
   (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and the R Squared. The experiment
   demonstrates that the 40\% training with 60\% testing splitting using
   linear regression shows the best result.},

Title = {Investigating student acceptance of an academic advising chatbot in
   higher education institutions},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 3},
Abstract = {The study explores factors affecting university students' behavioural
   intentions in adopting an academic advising chatbot. The study focuses
   on functional, socio-emotional, and relational factors affecting
   students' acceptance of an AI-driven academic advising chatbot. The
   research is based on a conceptual model derived from several constructs
   of traditional technology acceptance models, TAM, UTAUT, the latest
   AI-driven self-service technologies models, the Service Robot Acceptance
   (sRAM) model, and the intrinsic motivation Self Determination Theory
   (SDT) model. The proposed conceptual model has been tailored to an
   educational context. A questionnaire Survey of Non-purposive sampling
   technique was applied to collect data points from 207 university
   students from two major universities in the UAE. Subsequently, PLS-SEM
   causal modelling was applied for hypothesis testing. The results
   revealed that the functional elements, perceived ease of use and social
   influence significantly affect behavioural intention for chatbots'
   acceptance. However, perceived usefulness, autonomy, and trust did not
   show significant evidence of influence on the acceptance of an advising
   chatbot. The study reviews chatbot literature and presents
   recommendations for educational institutions to implement AI-driven
   chatbots effectively for academic advising. It is one of the first
   studies that assesses and examines factors that impact the willingness
   of higher education students to accept AI-driven academic advising
   chatbots. This study presents several theoretical contributions and
   practical implications for successful deployment of service-oriented
   chatbots for academic advising in the educational sector.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant popularity through
   wearable technologies. Several IoT devices are used in educational
   institutions, smart homes, and security management. Their widespread use
   in sports training applications using IoT (WS-IoT)-based wearable
   sensors is noteworthy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has
   evolved rapidly, and its applications have expanded across many diverse
   fields. Over the past few years, China has placed greater emphasis on
   physical education to enhance students' physical fitness and overall
   capabilities. A significant number of colleges and universities have
   adopted artificial intelligence to transform traditional single-mode
   sports training methods. This paper introduces a continuous monitoring
   system for sports individuals using the WS-IoT. The goal of coaches is
   to maximize the results of athlete training across various sports events
   using AI technology and their sports expertise. In this study, we
   examine the use of AI technology in sports and assess the practical
   implications of its implementation. To achieve the objective function,
   we used a Bayesian deep classifier and deep learning algorithms that
   utilize adaptive optimization. Utilizing artificial intelligence in
   Chinese educational institutions improves training efficiency and
   effectiveness. The system was then rigorously tested and analyzed in
   terms of the quality-of-service parameters, including communication
   collisions and packet loss rates. It is shown that packet loss rates
   increase with increasing packet numbers, but collision rates remain
   unchanged. Furthermore, a practical application of the system in
   colleges and universities showed that 14.4\% of the students were
   extremely satisfied with the use of teaching materials, 24.5\% were
   satisfied with the materials, 30.1\% were satisfied with the training
   methods, and 17.9\% were dissatisfied.},

   spectroscopy, artificial intelligence analysis methods, and analysis
   procedures; and examines the application of artificial intelligence.
   Finally, the advantages and disadvantages and development prospects of

Abstract = {Water temperature is one of the most important indicators of aquatic
   system, and accurate forecasting of water temperature is crucial for
   rivers. It is a complex process to accurately predict stream water
   temperature as it is impacted by a lot of factors (e.g., meteorological,
   hydrological, and morphological parameters). In recent years, with the
   development of computational capacity and artificial intelligence (AI),
   AI models have been gradually applied for river water temperature (RWT)
   forecasting. The current survey aims to provide a systematic review of
   the AI applications for modeling RWT. The review is to show the
   progression of advances in AI models. The pros and cons of the
   established AI models are discussed in detail. Overall, this research
   will provide references for hydrologists and water resources engineers
   and planners to better forecast RWT, which will benefit river ecosystem
   management.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques are used in many industries
   to evaluate the properties of components and inspect for flaws and
   anomalies in structures without altering the part's integrity or causing
   damage to the component being tested. This includes monitoring
   materials' condition (Material State Awareness (MSA)) and health of
   structures (Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)). NDE techniques are
   highly valuable tools to help prevent potential losses and hazards
   arising from the failure of a component while saving time and cost by
   not compromising its future usage. On the other hand, Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are useful tools
   which can help automating data collection and analyses, providing new

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by
   performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet
   threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to
   address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four
   intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical,
   intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide
   between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is
   developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding
   analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly
   preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job
   replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job
   level, and for ``lower{''} (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI
   first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as
   augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when
   it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of
   AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in
   predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the
   intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our
   theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes
   over more analytical tasks, giving the ``softer{''} intuitive and
   empathetic skills even more importance for service employees.
   Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and
   empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine
   integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental
   threat for human employment.},

Title = {Machine learning and artificial intelligence in cardiac transplantation:
   A systematic review},
Journal = {ARTIFICIAL ORGANS},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background This review aims to systematically evaluate the currently
   available evidence investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI)
   and machine learning (ML) in the field of cardiac transplantation.
   Furthermore, based on the challenges identified we aim to provide a
   series of recommendations and a knowledge base for future research in
   the field of ML and heart transplantation. Methods A systematic database
   search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of ML
   and/or AI in heart transplantation in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane
   database, and Google Scholar, from inception to November 2021. Results
   Our search yielded 237 articles, of which 13 studies were included in
   this review, featuring 463 850 patients. Three main areas of application
   were identified: (1) ML for predictive modeling of heart transplantation
   mortality outcomes; (2) ML in graft failure outcomes; (3) ML to aid
   imaging in heart transplantation. The results of the included studies
   suggest that AI and ML are more accurate in predicting graft failure and
   mortality than traditional scoring systems and conventional regression
   analysis. Major predictors of graft failure and mortality identified in
   ML models were: length of hospital stay, immunosuppressive regimen,
   recipient's age, congenital heart disease, and organ ischemia time.
   Other potential benefits include analyzing initial lab investigations
   and imaging, assisting a patient with medication adherence, and creating
   positive behavioral changes to minimize further cardiovascular risk.
   Conclusion ML demonstrated promising applications for improving heart
   transplantation outcomes and patient-centered care, nevertheless, there
   remain important limitations relating to implementing AI into everyday
   surgical practices.},

Abstract = {Industrial Automation (IA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) need an
   integrated platform. Due to the uncertainty of the time required for
   training or reasoning tasks, it is difficult to ensure the real-time
   performance of AI in the factory. Thus in this paper, we carry out a
   detailed survey on cloud-edge computing-based Industrial Cyber
   Intelligent Control Operating System (ICICOS) for industrial automation
   and artificial intelligence. The ICICOS is built based on IEC61499
   programming method and used to replace the obsolete Programmable Logic
   Controller (PLC). It is widely known that the third industrial
   revolution produced an important device: PLC. But the finite capability
   of PLC just only adapts automation which will not be able to support AI,
   especially deep learning algorithms. Edge computing promotes the
   expansion of distributed architecture to the Internet of Things (IoT),
   but little effect has been achieved in the territory of PLC. Therefore,
   ICICOS focuses on virtualization for IA and AI, so we introduce our
   ICICOS in this paper, and give the specific details.},

   intelligence, this research combines with the needs of English teaching
   to construct a English situation teaching in higher vocational colleges
   with the support of 5G network technology and artificial intelligence.
   Moreover, this research builds a data processing model based on the
   system architecture diagram of cache placement, uses storage space and
   computing resources to save more backhaul link bandwidth, and adopts the
   ``many to many{''} algorithm extended by the ``one to many{''}
   algorithm, and uses the on-demand method to obtain scenario teaching
   data from the cloud. In addition, this research constructs the
   intermediate link of data processing, and uses 5G network transmission
   to solve the problem of data transmission speed. Finally, this study
   uses a controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the
   artificial intelligence teaching model constructed in this study. The
   research shows that the English situation teaching method based on 5G
   network technology and artificial intelligence in vocational colleges
   has a certain effect and can effectively improve the English scores of

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the way people live in society.
   New technologies powered by AI have been applied in different sectors of
   the economy and the educational context is no different. AI has been
   considered a key to the development of learning strategies, especially
   in distance education. In this sense, this research aimed to identify
   the current state of Brazilian literature on AI applied to distance
   education. The Higher Education market in Brazil, which is the biggest
   in Latin America regarding the number of individuals able to enroll in a
   program, is still developing and distance education has grown rapidly.
   To reach the purpose of this paper, it was performed a Systematic
   Literature Review (SLR) to find the research conducted in graduate
   programs that investigate the subject of AI applied to distance
   education. The final analysis used a total of 63 studies - 26 master's
   theses and 37 doctoral dissertations. The main results show that most of
   the research on AI in distance education in Brazil was conducted in
   Computer Science (56\%) and Engineering (27\%). Only 6\% of the studies
   reviewed are from masters' or doctoral programs in Education. The result
   also shows that limited attention is paid to critical topics related to
   the growing introduction of AI in distance education, as such teachers'
   employability and technological training or the ethical implications of
   using AI for the educational process. As a result of this SLR, it was
   possible to suggest research opportunities considering the international
   agenda on AI.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a crucial role in providing
   diversified services because of its powerful capability of collecting
   real-time information. Generally, collected information is transmitted
   to a centralized resource-intensive cloud platform for service
   implementation. Edge Computing (EC) that deploys physical resources near
   road-side units is involved in IoV to support real-time services for
   vehicular users. Additionally, many measures are adopted to optimize the
   performance of EC-enabled IoV, but they hardly help make dynamic
   decisions according to real-time requests. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   is capable of enhancing the learning capacity of edge devices and thus
   assists in allocating resources dynamically. Although extensive research
   has employed AI to optimize EC performance, summaries with relative
   concepts or prospects are quite few. To address this gap, we conduct an
   exhaustive survey about utilizing AI in edge service optimization in
   IoV. Firstly, we establish the general condition and relative concepts
   about IoV, EC, and AI. Secondly, we review the edge service frameworks
   for IoV and explore the use of AI in edge server placement and service
   offloading. Finally, we discuss a number of open issues in optimizing
   edge services with AI.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been recently recognized as an
   essential aid for human traders. The advantages of the AI systems over
   human traders are that they can analyze an extensive data set from
   different sources in a fraction of a second and perform actual
   high-frequency trading (HFT) that can take advantage of market anomalies
   and price differences. This paper reviews the most important papers
   published in recent years that use the most advanced techniques to
   forecast financial asset trends and answer the question of whether those
   techniques can be used to successfully trade the complex financial
   markets. All systems use deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML)
   protocols to explore nonobvious correlations and phenomena that
   influence the probability of trading success. Their predictions are
   based on linear or nonlinear models often combined with social media
   investors' sentiment derivations or pattern recognitions. Most of the
   reviewed papers have proven the successful ability of their developed
   system to trade the financial markets.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence to support publishing and peer review: A summary
   and review},
Journal = {LEARNED PUBLISHING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 8},
Abstract = {Technology is being developed to support the peer review processes of
   journals, conferences, funders, universities, and national research
   evaluations. This literature and software summary discusses the partial
   or complete automation of several publishing-related tasks: suggesting
   appropriate journals for an article, providing quality control for
   submitted papers, finding suitable reviewers for submitted papers or
   grant proposals, reviewing, and review evaluation. It also discusses
   attempts to estimate article quality from peer review text and scores as
   well as from post-publication scores but not from bibliometric data. The
   literature and existing examples of working technology show that
   automation is useful for helping to find reviewers and there is good
   evidence that it can sometimes help with initial quality control of
   submitted manuscripts. Much other software supporting publishing and
   editorial work exists and is being used, but without published academic
   evaluations of its efficacy. The value of artificial intelligence (AI)
   to support reviewing has not been clearly demonstrated yet, however.
   Finally, whilst peer review text and scores can theoretically have value
   for post-publication research assessment, it is not yet widely enough
   available to be a practical evidence source for systematic automation.},

Abstract = {The global spread of COVID-19 has raised the importance of

   Developing new drug molecules to overcome any disease is a costly and
   lengthy process, but the process continues uninterrupted. The critical
   point to consider the drug design is to use the available data resources
   and to find new and novel leads. Once the drug target is identified,
   several interdisciplinary areas work together with artificial
   intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to get enriched
   drugs. These AI and ML methods are applied in every step of the
   computer-aided drug design, and integrating these AI and ML methods
   results in a high success rate of hit compounds. In addition, this AI
   and ML integration with high-dimension data and its powerful capacity
   have taken a step forward. Clinical trials output prediction through the
   AI/ML integrated models could further decrease the clinical trials cost
   by also improving the success rate. Through this review, we discuss the
   backend of AI and ML methods in supporting the computer-aided drug
   design, along with its challenge and opportunity for the pharmaceutical
   industry. Graphic abstract From the available information or data, the

Abstract = {Fishing wealth is one of the richest resources in the Sultanate of Oman.
   It is considered as one of the most important economic developments that
   nation depends on in a larger way. The Sultanate of Oman is
   characterized by the presence of a large fishing fleet as the number of
   fishing vessels and boats in it. Good research with the application of
   modern technology in fishermen boats is required to increase the quality
   of fishing by providing fishermen with a safe and secure fishing
   experience. Artificial intelligence (AI) in boat automation technology
   is new and it is a mandatory demand for Oman's fisheries sector. At the
   time of fishing, there are a lot of problems fishermen face such as
   weather changes, border tracking, navigation, illegal fishing, pirate
   attack, oil spill, technical fault in boats, etc. Therefore, the
   application of AI and related techniques in boat automation, information
   sharing, and preparation of documentation resources is very important in
   this sector. The main requirement for a fisherman is a high-quality
   fishing boat with proper communication devices to provide all the
   required information to fishermen and the control room. In this paper, a
   review has been made on fishermen's boats with artificial intelligence
   for a sustainable fishing experience ensuring safety, security,
   navigation, and sharing information for Omani fishermen.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies are developing rapidly,
   offering great promise for gastroenterol-ogy and particularly endoscopy.
   However, there are complex barriers and pitfalls that must be considered
   before widespread real-world clinical implementation can occur. This
   review highlights major ethical con-cerns related to data privacy and
   sharing that are essential for the development of AI models, through to
   prac-tical clinical issues such as potential patient harm,
   accountability, bias in decisions, and impact on workforce. Finally,
   current regulatory pathways are discussed, recognizing that these need
   to evolve to deal with unique new challenges, such as the adaptive and
   rapidly iterative nature of AI-based technologies, while striking a
   balance between ensuring patient safety and promoting innovation. (c)

Abstract = {To let robots in the education field better implement teaching tasks,
   the curriculum standards for information technology teaching is designed
   based on artificial intelligence robot technology. First, based on the
   robot education, the Lego robot (LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3) for the
   development and adoption of teaching resources in information technology
   courses is introduced. Then, according to the sensor teaching in robot
   education, the teaching contents for the information technology course
   are designed. The teaching method for the information technology course
   is improved based on sensor teaching. Finally, the feasibility of the
   existing teaching resources is evaluated, and the effect of information
   technology teaching is analyzed through a questionnaire survey. The
   results show that more than 80\% of students are interested in robot
   teaching, and more than 70\% of students can master relevant theoretical
   knowledge in practical operations. It is verified that robot education
   can arouse students' interest in information technology courses. The
   learning methods proposed can enable students to better master relevant
   theories, and it can improve students' operational ability and

Abstract = {The purpose is to further promote the healthy development of college
   students' physique, realize the monitoring of students' physique health
   management at any time, and then comprehensively ensure and promote the
   improvement and development of students' physique health level. From the
   perspective of artificial intelligence, the advantages of Internet
   technology in the field of sports are utilized to build a data chain
   system with college students' physical health test data as the core and
   the National Students' Physical Health Standard (Revised in 2014) as the
   benchmark, and build a college students' sports health management
   service platform. The platform constructed collects the physique health
   data of college students for online sorting and analysis, carries out
   multi-dimensional physical health evaluation and diagnosis for
   individual or class students, and forms a personalized, scientific and
   comprehensive exercise prescription intervention mechanism to ensure and
   promote the healthy development of students' physique. Meanwhile, the
   view of ``combination of sports and medicine{''} is put forward, which
   mainly refers to how to combine medicine and sports in life, learning
   and teaching. Therefore, it is essential to introduce the health
   management service system into colleges. Health management is not a
   simple intervention for students, and the most crucial thing is to
   cultivate students' health awareness of lifelong exercise and make them

Abstract = {Purpose of Review To highlight and review the application of artificial

   predicting procedural outcomes, stone passage, and recurrence rates. The
   systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist.
   Recent Findings This review discusses the newer advancements in
   AI-driven management strategies, which holds great promise to provide an
   essential step for personalized patient care and improved decision
   making. AI has been used in all areas of KSD including diagnosis, for
   predicting treatment suitability and success, basic science, quality of
   life (QOL), and recurrence of stone disease. However, it is still a
   research-based tool and is not used universally in clinical practice.
   This could be due to a lack of data infrastructure needed to train the
   algorithms, wider applicability in all groups of patients, complexity of
   its use and cost involved with it. The constantly evolving literature
   and future research should focus more on QOL and the cost of KSD
   treatment and develop evidence-based AI algorithms that can be used
   universally, to guide urologists in the management of stone disease.},

   applications in education. As pre-service teachers' attitudes towards
   educational technology that utilizes AI have a potential impact on the
   learning outcomes of their future students, it is essential to know more
   about pre-service teachers' acceptance of AI. The aims of this study are
   (1) to discover what factors determine pre-service teachers' intentions
   to utilize AI-based educational applications and (2) to determine
   whether gender differences exist within determinants that affect those
   behavioral intentions. A sample of 452 pre-service teachers (325 female)
   participated in a survey at one German university. Based on a prominent
   technology acceptance model, structural equation modeling, measurement
   invariance, and multigroup analysis were carried out. The results
   demonstrated that eight out of nine hypotheses were supported; perceived
   ease of use (\& beta; = 0.297{*}{*}{*}) and perceived usefulness (\&
   beta; = 0.501{*}{*}{*}) were identified as primary factors predicting
   pre-service teachers' intention to use AI. Furthermore, the latent mean
   differences results indicated that two constructs, AI anxiety (z = -
   3.217{*}{*}) and perceived enjoyment (z = 2.556{*}), were significantly
   different by gender. In addition, it is noteworthy that the paths from
   AI anxiety to perceived ease of use (p = 0.018{*}) and from perceived
   ease of use to perceived usefulness (p = 0.002{*}{*}) are moderated by
   gender. This study confirms the determinants influencing the behavioral
   intention based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 of German
   pre-service teachers to use AI-based applications in education.
   Furthermore, the results demonstrate how essential it is to address
   gender-specific aspects in teacher education because there is a high
   percentage of female pre-service teachers, in general. This study
   contributes to state of the art in AI-powered education and teacher
   education.},

Abstract = {Background: There has been tremendous growth in the amount of new
   surgical site infection (SSI) data generated. Key challenges exist in
   understanding the data for robust clinical decision-support. Limitations
   of traditional methodologies to handle these data led to the emergence
   of artificial intelligence (AI). This article emphasizes the
   capabilities of AI to identify patterns of SSI data. Method: Artificial
   intelligence comprises various subfields that present potential
   solutions to identify patterns of SSI data. Discussions on
   opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these methods to
   derive accurate SSI prediction are provided. Results: Four main
   challenges in dealing with SSI data were defined: (1) complexities in
   using SSI data, (2) disease knowledge, (3) decision support, and (4)
   heterogeneity. The implications of some of the recent advances in AI
   methods to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions:
   Artificial intelligence has the potential to provide insight in
   detecting and decision-support of SSI. As we turn SSI data into
   intelligence about the disease, we increase the possibility of improving
   surgical practice with the promise of a future optimized for the highest
   quality patient care.},

Abstract = {There are three income categories for Malaysians: the top 20\% (T20),
   the middle 40\% (M40), and the bottom 40\% (B40). The government has
   extended B40 ` s access to higher education to eliminate socioeconomic
   disparities and improve their lives. The number of students enrolled in
   bachelor's degree programmes at universities has risen annually.
   However, not all students who enrolled graduated. Machine learning
   approaches have been widely used and improved in education. However,
   research studies related to unsupervised learning in education are
   generally lacking. Therefore, this study proposes a clustering-based
   approach for classifying B40 students based on their performance in
   higher education institutions (HEIs). This study developed three
   unsupervised models (k-means, BIRCH, and DBSCAN) based on the data of
   B40 students. Several data pre-processing tasks and feature selection
   have been conducted on the raw dataset to ensure the quality of the
   training data. Each model is optimized using different tuning
   parameters. The observational results have shown that the optimized
   k-means on Model B (KMoB) achieved the highest performance among all the
   models. KMoB produced five clusters of B40 students based on their
   performance. With KMoB, this study may assist the government in reducing
   HEI drop-out rates, increasing graduation rates, and eventually boosting
   students' socioeconomic status.},

Abstract = {The problems and disadvantages of the traditional teaching mode of
   Taekwondo in colleges and universities are obvious, which is not
   conducive to cultivating the interest of contemporary college students
   in learning Taekwondo. In order to improve the teaching effect of
   Taekwondo, based on the intelligent algorithm of human body feature
   recognition, this study uses support vector machine to construct a
   Taekwondo teaching effect evaluation model based on artificial
   intelligence algorithm. The model corrects the movement of the students
   by recognizing the movement characteristics of the students' Taekwondo
   and can conduct the movement guidance and exercises through the
   simulation method. In order to verify the performance of the model in
   this study, this study set up control experiments and mathematical
   statistical methods to verify the performance of the model. The research
   results show that the model proposed in this paper has a certain effect
   and can be applied to teaching practice},

Abstract = {Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the
   integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer
   offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its
   variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take
   into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to
   receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain
   in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers
   despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most
   commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which
   may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular,
   artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the
   qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians,
   including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of
   the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic
   phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact
   of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes
   in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow
   of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to
   administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be
   envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as
   applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor
   types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common
   clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating
   AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated
   for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight
   increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use
   and to impact future directions in cancer care.},

Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) applications, such as ChatGPT
   (Chat Generative Pre -trained Transformer) and Midjourney, have recently
   attracted much attention from researchers and school teachers. While
   many people are eager to learn more about GAI applications, some
   scholars are concerned about the potential misuse of them. It is
   predicted that the use of GAI applications will increase rapidly in the
   coming years. Therefore, it is important to consider the challenges and
   research issues through some concrete application examples of using GAI
   for education. In this position paper, the authors aim to address these
   issues from the perspectives of academic research and educational
   objectives. Along with defining GAI, several illustrative examples of
   using GAI applications in educational settings are provided. Moreover,
   potential research issues of GAI-based learning, including research
   design, relevant learning strategies, research focus, and measuring
   tools, are discussed. ET\&S journal is especially welcoming research on
   unlocking the potential of GAI for education to realize the two notions
   of ``Knowing {[}why] is the essential element for learners to have
   in-depth understanding{''} and ``It is all about prompts: Get rid of the
   `search' mindset and use `programming prompt' instead.{''}},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence has impacted education in recent years.
   Datafication of education has allowed developing automated methods to
   detect patterns in extensive collections of educational data to estimate
   unknown information and behavior about the students. This research has
   focused on finding accurate predictive models to identify at-risk
   students. This challenge may reduce the students' risk of failure or
   disengage by decreasing the time lag between identification and the real
   at-risk state. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, an
   in-depth analysis of a predictive model to detect at-risk students is
   performed. This model has been tested using data available in an
   institutional data mart where curated data from six semesters are
   available, and a method to obtain the best classifier and training set
   is proposed. Second, a method to determine a threshold for evaluating
   the quality of the predictive model is established. Third, an early
   warning system has been developed and tested in a real educational
   setting being accurate and useful for its purpose to detect at-risk
   students in online higher education. The stakeholders (i.e., students
   and teachers) can analyze the information through different dashboards,
   and teachers can also send early feedback as an intervention mechanism
   to mitigate at-risk situations. The system has been evaluated on two
   undergraduate courses where results shown a high accuracy to correctly
   detect at-risk students.},

Abstract = {Depression is one of the most complex psychiatric diseases that cause
   the most serious harm in today's society. Searching for objective
   biomarkers of depression has always been the focus and difficulty of
   psychiatric research and clinical practice. Numerous studies have shown
   that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with artificial
   intelligence technology might be currently the most likely biologic
   marker to find breakthroughly in mental illness such as depression.
   However, the current potential objective biomarkers of depression based
   on psychiatric imaging have not been consistently concluded. From the
   perspective of combining psychoradiology with artificial intelligence
   technology represented by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL),
   this paper summarizes and analyses the related studies on depression
   from three components of the clinical practice including disease
   diagnosis, prevention and treatment for the first time. We found that a.
   the brain areas with diagnostic value are mainly concentrated in:
   precuneus, cingulate gyms, inferior parietal lobule, insula, thalamus
   and hippocampus; b. the brain regions with preventive value are mainly
   concentrated in: precuneus, central posterior gyms, dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, middle temporal gyri; c. brain
   regions with predictive therapeutic response are mainly concentrated in:
   precuneus, cingulate gyms, inferior parietal lobule, middle frontal
   gyms, middle occipital gyms, lingual gyms. Future research can be
   improved by enlarging the sample size through multi-center collaboration
   and data transformation, and at the same time non-imaging data can be
   applied to data mining, which will help to improve the classification
   accuracy of artificial intelligence models, and provide scientific
   evidence and reference for the studies on exploring psychoradiological
   objective biomarkers for depression and its clinical application.},

Abstract = {Introduction The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of
   Radiologists (RANZCR) led the medical community in Australia and New
   Zealand in considering the impact of machine learning and artificial
   intelligence (AI) in health care. RANZCR identified that medical
   leadership was largely absent from these discussions, with a notable
   absence of activity from governments in the Australasian region up to
   2019. The clinical radiology and radiation oncology sectors were
   considered ripe for the adoption of AI, and this raised a range of
   concerns about how to ensure the ethical application of AI and to guide
   its safe and appropriate use in our two specialties. Methods RANZCR's
   Artificial Intelligence Committee undertook a landscape review in 2019
   anddetermined that AI within clinical radiology and radiation oncology
   had the potential to grow rapidly and significantly impact the
   professions. In order to address this, RANZCR drafted ethical principles
   on the use of AI and standards to guide deployment and engaged in
   extensive stakeholder consultation to ensure a range of perspectives
   were received and considered. Results RANZCR published two key bodies of
   work: The Ethical Principles of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, and
   the Standards of Practice for Artificial Intelligence in Clinical
   Radiology. Conclusion RANZCR's publications in this area have
   established a solid foundation to prepare for the application of AI,
   however more work is needed. We will continue to assess the evolution of
   AI and ML within our professions, strive to guide the upskilling of
   clinical radiologists and radiation oncologists, advocate for
   appropriate regulation and produce guidance to ensure that patient care
   is delivered safely.},

Title = {Student engagement in online learning in Latin American higher education
   during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {593-619},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced higher education institutions to
   implement online learning activities based on virtual platforms,
   allowing little time to prepare and train faculty members to familiarize
   students with digital technologies. While previous studies have looked
   at how students engaged with digital technologies in their learning
   activities, the characteristics of the student engagement in online
   learning remain underexplored. Therefore, a systematic review of the
   literature on student engagement in online learning in higher education
   is much needed. This article synthesizes the findings on student
   engagement in Latin American higher education institutions during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the studies on online learning
   activities, this review examines student engagement from behavioural,
   cognitive and affective dimensions and identifies the main
   characteristics of student engagement from these tripartite dimensions.
   The implications of the findings for online learning in Latin American
   higher education are as follows: (a) to transform higher education, (b)
   to provide adequate professional training, (c) to improve Internet
   connectivity, (d) to ensure quality online learning in higher education
   and (e) to provide emotional support. These findings will provide
   valuable guidance for teachers, educational authorities and policy
   makers and help them make informed decisions to use effective strategies
   to support online learning in higher education institutions.
   Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The COVID-19
   pandemic has disrupted the normal operation of higher education
   institutions across Latin America, impelling a shift from face-to-face
   instruction to online teaching and learning. Research on online learning
   in Latin American higher education has been conducted, but the findings
   and their implications are yet to be widely disseminated among
   researchers, practitioners and decision-makers. What this paper adds
   Providing a systematic review of research on student engagement in
   online learning in Latin American higher education institutions.
   Analyzing the construct of student engagement in online learning from
   tripartite dimensions-behavioral, cognitive and affective-in the Latin
   American higher education context. Identifying the characteristics
   associated to each dimension of student engagement in online learning.
   Implications for practice and/or policy The need to transform the higher
   education system in Latin America and beyond, at two levels: to improve
   Internet connectivity at the technological level and to ensure the
   quality of online education at the pedagogical level. The urgency to
   offer an adequate professional training regarding the use of new
   technologies in online learning environments. The significance for
   higher education institutions to provide emotional support for students
   during the COVID-10 pandemic.},

Abstract = {In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), this paper attempts to
   develop strategies to improve the teaching effect of art major courses
   in colleges, and overcome the existing problems with the improvement
   process. Firstly, the authors analyzed the manifestations of the
   teaching effects of art major courses, and then discussed the relevant
   factors that affect the teaching effect of such courses. Next, the
   potential improving effects of the AI on the teaching effect of art
   major courses were expounded in details. On this basis, an evaluation
   model was developed to reflect the improving effects. Finally, several
   AI-based strategies were put forward to optimize the teaching of art
   major courses in collages. This research fully integrates theoretical
   analysis with model calculation, and innovatively introduces the AI to
   the teaching effect improvement in major courses.},

Title = {Developing a gamified artificial intelligence educational robot to
   promote learning effectiveness and behavior in laboratory safety courses
   for undergraduate students},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 14},
Abstract = {According to previous studies, traditional laboratory safety courses are
   delivered in a classroom setting where the instructor teaches and the
   students listen and read the course materials passively. The course
   content is also uninspiring and dull. Additionally, the teaching period
   is spread out, which adds to the instructor's workload. As a result,
   students become less motivated to learn. In contrast, artificially
   intelligent educational robots (AIERs), help students learn while
   lessening the workload on instructors by enhancing teaching strategies,
   using robots to substitute for teachers, giving students access to a
   variety of instructional content, and improving interaction with
   students through the use of intelligent voice interactions and Q\&A
   systems to promote student engagement in learning. If the robot is used
   for a long time for learning, it may lead to a decrease in students'
   interest in learning. Therefore, this study introduces the GAFCC model
   (the theory-driven gamification goal, access, feedback, challenge,
   collaboration design model) as an instructional design model to guide
   the development of a gamified AIER system, aiming to improve students'
   motivation and learning effectiveness for laboratory safety courses. To
   test the effectiveness of the system, this study conducted an
   experimental study at a university in China in the summer of 2022. 53
   participants participated in the research, with a random sample taken
   from each group. Each participant was able to choose the time of their
   free time to engage in the experiment. There were 18, 19, and 16
   participants in experimental group 1, experimental group 2, and the
   traditional group, respectively. Students in experimental group 1
   learned using the gamified AIER system, students in experimental group 2
   learned on a general anthropomorphic robot system and the control group
   received traditional classroom learning. The experimental results showed
   that compared to the other two groups, the gamified AIER system guided
   by the GAFCC model significantly improved students' learning achievement
   and enhanced their learning motivation, flow experience, and
   problem-solving tendency. In addition, students who adopted this
   approach exhibited more positive behaviors and reduced cognitive load in
   the learning process.},

Abstract = {Two innovative systems based on feed-forward and recurrent neural
   network used for qualitative analysis has been applied to specimens of
   different fruit tea. Their performance was compared against the
   conventional methods of artificial intelligence. The proposed systems
   are a combination of data preprocessing methods, genetic algorithms and
   Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm used for learning feed forward and
   recurrent neural networks. The initial weights and biases of neural
   networks chosen by the use of genetic algorithms were then tuned with a
   LM algorithm. The evaluation was made on the basis of accuracy and
   complexity criteria. The main advantage of the proposed systems is the
   elimination of the random selection of the network weights and biases
   resulting in the increased efficiency of the systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {Correlation of pathology reports with radiology examinations has long
   been of interest to radiologists and helps to facilitate peer learning.
   Such correlation also helps meet regulatory requirements, ensures
   quality, and supports multidisciplinary conferences and patient care.
   Additional offshoots of such correlation include evaluating for and
   ensuring concordance of pathology results with radiology interpretation
   and procedures as well as ensuring specimen adequacy after biopsy. For
   much of the history of radiology, this correlation has been done
   manually, which is time consuming and cumbersome and provides coverage
   of only a fraction of radiology examinations performed. Electronic
   storage and indexing of radiology and pathology information laid the
   foundation for easier access and for the development of automated
   artificial intelligence methods to match pathology information with
   radiology reports. More recent techniques have resulted in near
   comprehensive coverage of radiology examinations with methods to present
   results and solicit feedback from end users. Newer deep learning
   language modeling techniques will advance these methods by providing
   more robust automated and comprehensive radiology-pathology correlation
   with the ability to rapidly, flexibly, and iteratively tune models to
   site and user preference.},

   clustering solution through CitNetExplorer (n = 841) concluded that the
   essence of AI ethics for educational purposes included deontology,
   utilitarianism, and virtue, while the principles of AI ethics in
   education included transparency, justice, fairness, equity,
   non-maleficence, responsibility, and privacy. Future research could
   consider the influence of AI interpretability on AI ethics in education
   because the ability to interpret the AI decisions could help judge

   agent decisions and behaviors in complex systems. We propose an
   innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning and

   further developments of ABM, especially modeling agent behaviors, in the

Abstract = {Access to big data analyzed by supercomputers using advanced
   mathematical algorithms (i.e., deep machine learning) has allowed for
   enhancement of cognitive output (i.e., visual imaging interpretation) to
   previously unseen levels and promises to fundamentally change the
   practice of medicine. This field, known as ``artificial intelligence{''}
   (AI), is making significant progress in areas such as automated clinical
   decision making, medical imaging analysis, and interventional
   procedures, and has the potential to dramatically influence the practice
   of interventional cardiology. The unique nature of interventional
   cardiology makes it an ideal target for the development of AI-based
   technologies designed to improve real-time clinical decision making,
   streamline workflow in the catheterization laboratory, and standardize
   catheter-based procedures through advanced robotics. This review
   provides an introduction to AI by highlighting its scope, potential
   applications, and limitations in interventional cardiology. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI), seen as an engineering domain,
   has been introduced into school education, but its pedagogy remains
   unclear. In general, group learning has been applied as a primary form
   of instruction in hands-on engineering activities. This learning
   approach is more common in higher education. School students are less
   mature; therefore, the benefits of adopting group learning as a
   pedagogical approach remain unclear. Group learning quality can be
   reflected by student-student interactions and dialogue within a group,
   and is classified into four types: collective, cooperating-in-parallel,
   dominant/defensive, and expert/novice. Accordingly, this experimental
   study involved 37 middle school students, and explored how they
   interacted within groups when learning AI through hands-on activities in
   the four group learning types. The Teacher Scheme for Educational
   Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) was used to code student-student interactions
   and compute their frequencies, and Lag Sequential Analysis was used to
   analyze the behavioral interaction sequence characteristics of the four
   group interaction patterns. The results showed that the expert/novice
   group learning had higher frequency of interaction, and also produced
   the longest, richest, and most complex sequences. The results suggest
   that this is the optimal approach to learning for younger students in
   hands-on AI activities as it encourages group members to interact with
   each other and reach a consensus. The results contribute to the
   literature by suggesting effective practices and confirming the use of
   T-SEDA in a new engineering school subject.},

Title = {Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {112},
Number = {1},
Pages = {23-42},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence
   (AI) knowledge to K-12 students, like many engineering and technology
   education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
   resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
   to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
   schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
   process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
   complex environments. Purpose: Guided by an integrated theoretical
   framework of social constructionism, this research examined the process
   of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed with external
   influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives and responses
   in mediating external influences into local schools and classrooms.
   Methods: A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted in relation to an AI
   curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS) teachers from primary
   schools. Data collected from ethnographic observation, teacher
   interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open coding and
   triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist approach.
   Results: Three sets of external influences were found salient for
   teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of state-level
   educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university, and students'
   media and technology environments. The teachers' situational logics and
   strategic actions were reconstructed with thick descriptions to uncover
   how they navigated and negotiated the external influences to fulfill
   local challenges and expectations in classrooms and schools.
   Conclusions: The ethnographic study uncovered the dynamic and
   multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative curriculum
   development, and offers insights to inform policymaking, teacher
   education, and student support in engineering education.},

Abstract = {The Smart Home designed to extend older adults independence is emerging
   as a clinical solution to the growing ageing population. Nurses will and
   should play a key role in the development and application of Smart Home
   technology. Accordingly, conceptual frameworks are needed for nurse
   scientists who are collaborating with multidisciplinary research teams
   in developing an intelligent Smart Home that assists with managing older
   adults' health. We present a conceptual framework that is grounded in
   critical realism and pragmatism, informing a unique mixed methodological
   approach to generating, analyzing, and contextualizing sensor data for
   clinician-based machine learning. This framework can guide nurse
   scientists in knowledge construction as they participate in
   multidisciplinary health-assistive Smart Home and artificial
   intelligence research. In this paper, we review philosophical
   underpinnings and explicate how this framework can guide nurse
   scientists collaborating with engineers to develop intelligent
   health-assistive Smart Homes. It is critical that clinical nursing
   knowledge is integrated into Smart Home and artificial intelligence
   features. A conceptual framework and practical method will provide
   needed structure for knowledge construction by nurse scientists.},

Abstract = {The progress of societies, their development, and their ability to
   compete economically depend on education. Education is both affected by
   changes in all these areas and affects them. The desired results from
   the new wave of industrial revolution called industry 4.0 can only be
   achieved through education as well. Industry 4.0 is the new industrial
   revolution that first appeared in Germany and includes applications such
   as autonomous vehicles, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence
   applications, block chain, and cloud computing systems. With the
   innovations brought by the revolution, it has been changing the ways of
   doing business and the competencies required from employees. Industry
   4.0 requires university students to have new knowledge, competencies and
   skills before graduation, the workforce to acquire new skills, and the
   restructuring and transformation of higher education to achieve all of
   these. Thus, industry 4.0 is reshaping the future of education. This
   review study focuses on the connection of higher education and industry
   4.0 by examining the national and international literature. It aims to
   present a general assessment of the steps to be taken in higher
   education in parallel with the requirements of industry 4.0 and the new
   competencies that should be acquired by graduates. It is concluded with
   some suggestions about what should be done regarding the international
   standards in order for the higher education curricula to adapt to the
   existing processes and changes, to train human resources in accordance
   with the conditions and demands of the age, what new competencies the
   workforce should have, and the steps to be followed regarding industry

Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Purpose/objective: To date there has been limited research looking at
   patient views on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in
   radiotherapy. The aim of this study is to adapt and utilise a validated
   patient questionnaire to develop an understanding of current patient
   views on the use of AI in radiotherapy. Materials/methods: An existing
   questionnaire, developed to assess understanding of patients' views on
   the implementation of AI in radiology, was adapted to the field of
   radiotherapy. The questionnaire was distributed to cancer patients
   receiving radiotherapy treatment between November 2021 and March 2022.
   Completed questionnaires were analysed to assess patient levels of
   positivity or negativity towards AI. Results were grouped into five
   factors, representing underlying patient perspectives, and correlation
   of factors with demographic variables was assessed. Results: In total,
   95 patients participated. Overall, there was a moderately negative
   patient view towards the use of AI in radiotherapy. Certain factors drew
   a more negative response than others, for example patients desire
   significant personal interaction with healthcare professionals during
   the course of their treatment. No significant correlation was found
   between the demographics of age and gender and the strength of views
   towards the use of AI in radiotherapy. Conclusion: This study has found
   that there are clear patient concerns around the use of AI in
   radiotherapy. As the use of AI in this field increases in future years,
   it will therefore be extremely important to educate and involve patients
   in the future direction of this technology.

Abstract = {The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial
   intelligence (AI) systems in drug design. Neural networks, which are one
   of the systems employed in AI, are used to identify chemical structures
   that can have medical relevance. Successful training of neural networks
   must be preceded by the acquisition of relevant information about
   chemical compounds, functional groups, and their possible biological
   activity. In general, a neural network requires a large set of training
   data, which must contain information about the chemical
   structure-biological activity relationship. The data can come from
   experimental measurements, but can also be generated using appropriate
   quantum models. In many of the studies presented below, authors showed a
   significant potential of neural networks to produce generalizations
   based on even relatively narrow training data. Despite the fact that
   neural network systems have been known for more than 40 years, it is
   only recently that they have seen rapid development due to the wider
   availability of computing power. In recent years, there has been a
   growing interest in deep learning techniques, bringing network modeling
   to a new level of abstraction. Deep learning allows combining what seems
   to be causally distant phenomena and effects, and to associate facts in
   a way resembling the human mind. This article is categorized under:

Abstract = {Lifelong learning approaches that include digital, transversal, and
   practical skills (i.e., critical thinking, communication, collaboration,
   information literacy, analytical, metacognitive, reflection, and other
   research skills) are required in order to be equitable and inclusive and
   stimulate personal development. Realtime interaction between teachers
   and students and the ability for students to choose courses from
   curricula are guaranteed by decentralized online learning. Moreover,
   through blockchain, it is possible to acquire skills regarding the
   structure and content while also implementing learning tools.
   Additionally, documentation validation should be equally crucial to
   speeding up the process and reducing costs and paperwork. Finally,
   blockchains are open and inclusive processes that include people and
   cultures from all walks of life. Learning in Higher Education
   Institutions (HEI) is facilitated by new technologies, connecting
   blockchain to sustainability, which helps understand the relationship
   between technologies and sustainability. Besides serving as a secure
   transaction system, blockchain technology can help decentralize, provide
   security and integrity, and offer anonymity and encryption, therefore,
   promoting a transaction rate increase. This study investigates an
   alternative in which HEI include a blockchain network to provide the
   best sustainable education system. Students' opinions were analyzed, and
   they considered that blockchain technology had a very positive influence
   on learning performance.},

Abstract = {Purpose This research aimed to examine the current status of artificial
   intelligence's (AI's) integration into Chinese adult education, by
   analyzing the influences that AI has had on current adult education
   practices in China and by discussing the opportunities and challenges
   that adult education in China is faced with under the rapid AI
   development in the past 12 years.Design/methodology/approach This
   research employed systematic literature analysis. CNKI (China National
   Knowledge Infrastructure) Chinese Journals Full-text Database was used
   to collect scholarly publications on the use of AI in adult education in
   China that was published in the past decade. Data analysis included the
   following steps: identifying key words and phrases, detecting underlying
   meanings, searching for logical connections and relationships,
   collecting and connecting evidence to the research questions, and
   drawing logical and credible conclusions.Findings The findings indicated
   that AI has been gradually integrated into Chinese adult education
   through innovations and explorations and AI's influence is broad and
   profound. More specifically, the following five main themes were
   identified. The field's understanding of AI technology and AI's
   influence on adult education has evolved and become more comprehensive;
   AI challenges traditional Chinese adult education practices by helping
   to actualize personalized learning and precision education; AI
   transforms adult learning resource development; AI helps to turn
   learning environment into an open intelligent learning system; and
   lastly, AI urges the shift of adult educator's role in adult
   learning.Research limitations/implications This study is not without
   limitations. Contextualized in China, this study shares the limitations
   with other single country studies. One such limitation is
   ``cumulation{''} issue. This study should be replicated in other country
   contexts to further validate the generalizability of the five main
   themes identified in this research.Practical implications The five
   themes identified in this study can help understand the promises and
   challenges that AI brings to the field of adult education in China.
   These five themes can also serve as an integrated lens through which one
   can make sense of AI's integration into other countries' adult education
   practices.Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need of
   understanding the current status of AI's integration into and influence
   on the field of adult education in China.},

Abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) promises to have a
   transformational impact on quality in medicine, including in radiology.
   However, experience has shown that quality tools alone are often not
   sufficient to bring about consistent excellent performance.
   Specifically, rather than assuming outcome targets are consistently met,
   in quality control, managers assume that wide variation is likely
   present unless proven otherwise with objective performance data. In this
   article, we discuss what we consider to be the eight essential elements
   required to achieve comprehensive process control, necessary to deliver
   consistent quality in radiology: a process control framework,
   performance measures, performance standards and targets, monitoring
   applications, prediction models, optimization models, feedback
   mechanisms, and accountability mechanisms. We consider these elements to
   be universally applicable, including in the application of AI-based
   models. We also discuss how the lack of specific elements of a quality
   control program can hinder widespread quality control efforts. We
   illustrate the concept using the example of a CT radiation dose
   optimization and process control program previously developed by one of
   the authors and provide several examples of how AI-based tools might be
   used for quality control in radiology.},

Abstract = {The widespread use of artificial intelligence in the field of design
   teaching has become a development trend, and for the art design
   profession, we should conform to and actively adapt to this development
   trend, change the original teaching mode, innovate their own teaching
   methods, constantly enrich the teaching methods, so as to improve the
   quality of teaching, and constantly cultivate high-quality art design
   talents in the new era. For the subject students, they grow up under the
   Internet. They are more affectionate to many new technologies, and the
   traditional teaching methods have some problems to meet their learning
   needs, so it is very necessary to introduce artificial intelligence in
   teaching. In this paper, we will discuss the optimization of the
   curriculum system of art design in higher education institutions in the
   context of artificial intelligence. The purpose of guiding the
   innovation of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate
   students' learning ability and innovation ability and learn to use
   design ideas in practice. Integrating design thinking with artificial
   intelligence gets four innovative ways of culture, form, function, and
   emotion in terms of innovation at the design thinking level; in terms of
   thinking innovation guidance, it gets the guidance of role
   transformation and model practice, integrating artificial intelligence
   with environmental art design thinking, designing interactive spaces
   more in line with the times, and promoting the harmonious development of

   Artificial Intelligence: A Case Study of Cancer-Staging Data in Biology},
Journal = {ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},

Abstract = {It is essential to utilize deep-learning algorithms based on big data
   for the implementation of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
   Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number
   of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in
   an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an
   approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a
   deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into
   a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set
   to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set.
   Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples.
   Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the
   effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small
   sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the
   approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small
   labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed
   approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This
   research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical
   machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a
   deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use
   of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application
   scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on
   deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This
   research is also expected to contribute to the comprehensive promotion
   of new-generation artificial intelligence. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {One of the deadly diseases among humans is Cancer, which occurs almost
   anywhere in the human body. Cancer is caused by the cells that spread
   into the surrounding tissues by dividing itself uncontrollably. Breast
   Cancer is the most common cancer among women. Early detection and
   diagnosis of breast cancer are treatable and curable. Many women have no
   symptoms for this cancer at an early stage. The abnormal cells in the
   breast will risk for the development of breast cancer. So, it is
   important for women to regularly examine their breast. Technologies can
   be utilized in a smarter way with Artificial Intelligence techniques to
   assist the women during their examination of the breast at their living
   place to avoid the risk of breast cancer. The main aim is to develop a
   low cost self-examining device for the detection of breast cancer and
   abnormality in the breast using an efficient optical method,
   Deep-learning algorithm and Internet of Things.},

Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {This paper provides a broad bibliometric overview of the important
   conceptual advances that have been published during COVID-19 within
   ``e-learning in higher education.{''} E-learning as a concept has been
   widely used in the academic and professional communities and has been
   approved as an educational approach during COVID-19. This article starts
   with a literature review of e-learning. Diverse subjects have appeared
   on the topic of e-learning, which is indicative of the dynamic and
   multidisciplinary nature of the field. These include analyses of the
   most influential authors, of models and networks for bibliometric
   analysis, and progress towards the current research within the most
   critical areas. A bibliometric review analyzes data of 602 studies
   published (2020-2021) in the Web of Science (WoS) database to fully
   understand this field. The data were examined using VOSviewer,
   CiteSpace, and KnowledgeMatrix Plus to extract networks and bibliometric
   indicators about keywords, authors, organizations, and countries. The
   study concluded with several results within higher education. Many
   converging words or sub-fields of e-learning in higher education
   included distance learning, distance learning, interactive learning,
   online learning, virtual learning, computer-based learning, digital
   learning, and blended learning (hybrid learning). This research is
   mainly focused on pedagogical techniques, particularly e-learning and
   collaborative learning, but these are not the only trends developing in
   this area. The sub-fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning,
   and deep learning constitute new research directions for e-learning in
   light of COVID-19 and are suggestive of new approaches for further
   analysis.},

   and Behavior Analysis for College Students' Rural Tourism
   Entrepreneurship},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {To promote the development of the rural economy and improve
   entrepreneurship education in colleges and universities, college
   students' willingness and behavior toward rural tourism entrepreneurship
   were investigated in this study. First of all, based on the previous
   research results, the influencing factor model was determined for
   college students' entrepreneurial intention. Second, a questionnaire
   survey was made to collect data from a university in Xi'an City.
   Finally, the artificial neural network (ANN), improved by a genetic
   algorithm (GA) based on an artificial intelligence network, was used to
   study the relationship between college students' entrepreneurial
   intention and behavior, and the simulation was carried out on
   MATLAB2013b software. The results show that the average evaluation
   accuracy is 81.13\% for 60 groups of data using the unmodified back
   propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm, while the average
   evaluation accuracy is 92.17\% for the BPNN algorithm improved and
   optimized by GA, with an ascent of 11.04\%. Therefore, the BPNN
   algorithm improved and optimized by GA is better than the unmodified
   BPNN algorithm; It is also feasible and effective in the analysis of
   influencing factors of college students' entrepreneurial intention and
   behavior. The research provides a basis for colleges and universities to
   carry out entrepreneurship education on a large scale and to cultivate
   their innovative talents.},

Abstract = {Purpose The performance analysis of top 50 management institutions of
   India is conducted to understand their efficiency in utilizing available
   resources. The importance of different indicators is investigated to
   identify most preferred strategies of top management institutions in the
   country in order to meet the expectations of all stakeholders.
   Artificial neural networks models are applied for pattern recognition
   and classification purpose using self-organized map algorithms. A huge
   reservoir of young generation is being trained every year to meet the
   demand of business in different sectors of economies. It becomes a
   matter of concern to know the performance of the management institutes
   to ensure the overall national progress, which can be done by enabling
   organizations to improve their efficiency and effectiveness, provided
   the right information and skills are served. Data envelopment analysis
   (DEA) and self-organizing maps are utilized together to take advantages
   of optimization and prediction capabilities inherent in each method, and
   they may be beneficial to assess institution's competitive position and
   design their own strategies in order to improve. The paper aims to
   discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The DEA is used to
   understand the utilization of resources by institutions on the bases of
   efficiency scores. Due to a greater flexibility and adaptability, neural
   technique, i.e. self-organized map, which is an artificial
   intelligence-based technique, a popular unsupervised learning model with
   a capability to capture patterns from data sets, is used. In this study,
   various parameters like qualification of faculty, research output of
   faculty members, expenditure made for functioning of the institution,
   etc., are considered. These academic and operational indicators are
   investigated in relation to the rank score and the efficiency score of
   top management institutions, and different strategies as a combination
   of input as well as output indicators are identified. Findings In the
   analysis, three types of strategies are identified. At present, the
   focus on salary packages of graduates seems the most utilized strategy.
   It is also observed that the strategy of having good performance, in
   terms of consultancy, peer and employer perception, has the highest
   success rate (in terms of score used for ranking). Results obtained
   using both techniques shows that due to high deviation and less explored
   research publications and sponsored research project is an opportunity
   that institutions can work upon to have maximum output. But to maintain
   consistency in terms of the high rank score and efficiency score,
   management institutions need to focus on consultancy, peer and employer
   perception. Practical implications - This research identifies the
   different parameters categorized into various inputs and outputs for the
   management institutions in India for the benchmarking. It studies the
   importance of identified parameters in terms of success (rank score and
   efficiency score). Further investigation of relationship between
   parameters and success is conducted. Different strategies as a
   combination of parameters are identified. The current choice of top
   management institutions is revealed in terms of their preference and
   effectiveness of strategy. This research also provides some insight
   about long-term and short-term strategies, which may be beneficial to
   education managers or decision makers.
   Originality/value It is one of the rare papers in terms of performance
   measurement through data envelopment method and identification of
   strategy using artificial intelligence. This paper utilized a hybrid
   methodology that integrates these two data analytic methods to capture
   an innovative performance and strategies prediction in education system.},

Abstract = {The most popular way of predicting academic success in higher education
   is to use students' existing course grades. In this study we propose a
   novel approach to predict academic success in higher education with use
   of personality traits rather than existing course grades. Our main focus
   on this multidisciplinary study is to get the benefits of psychology and
   computer science to predict academic success of students in higher
   education, by using Machine Learning. We have used Big Five features as
   the personality traits of 2,575 higher education students and tested our
   proposed method on 20 different course categories. At the end of this
   study we conclude that Machine Learning can be used for predicting
   academic success while using all of the Big Five personality trait
   dimensions. With our proposed method, Big Five traits of prospective
   students can be used to predict higher education student success for the
   applied department. Our method can also be applied to different
   departments or course groups. This approach can be improved such that,
   the higher education institutes can even suggest departments to
   students, that they can be more successful.},

Title = {Prediction of Blast-Induced Ground Vibration at a Limestone Quarry: An
   Artificial Intelligence Approach},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Ground vibration is one of the most unfavourable environmental effects
   of blasting activities, which can cause serious damage to neighboring
   homes and structures. As a result, effective forecasting of their
   severity is critical to controlling and reducing their recurrence. There
   are several conventional vibration predictor equations available
   proposed by different researchers but most of them are based on only two
   parameters, i.e., explosive charge used per delay and distance between
   blast face to the monitoring point. It is a well-known fact that
   blasting results are influenced by a number of blast design parameters,
   such as burden, spacing, powder factor, etc. but these are not being
   considered in any of the available conventional predictors and due to
   that they show a high error in predicting blast vibrations. Nowadays,
   artificial intelligence has been widely used in blast engineering. Thus,
   three artificial intelligence approaches, namely Gaussian process
   regression (GPR), extreme learning machine (ELM) and backpropagation
   neural network (BPNN) were used in this study to estimate ground
   vibration caused by blasting in Shree Cement Ras Limestone Mine in
   India. To achieve that aim, 101 blasting datasets with powder factor,
   average depth, distance, spacing, burden, charge weight, and stemming
   length as input parameters were collected from the mine site. For
   comparison purposes, a simple multivariate regression analysis (MVRA)
   model as well as, a nonparametric regression-based technique known as
   multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) was also constructed
   using the same datasets. This study serves as a foundational study for
   the comparison of GPR, BPNN, ELM, MARS and MVRA to ascertain their
   respective predictive performances. Eighty-one (81) datasets
   representing 80\% of the total blasting datasets were used to construct
   and train the various predictive models while 20 data samples (20\%)
   were utilized for evaluating the predictive capabilities of the
   developed predictive models. Using the testing datasets, major
   indicators of performance, namely mean squared error (MSE), variance
   accounted for (VAF), correlation coefficient (R) and coefficient of
   determination (R-2) were compared as statistical evaluators of model
   performance. This study revealed that the GPR model exhibited superior
   predictive capability in comparison to the MARS, BPNN, ELM and MVRA. The
   GPR model showed the highest VAF, R and R-2 values of 99.1728\%, 0.9985
   and 0.9971 respectively and the lowest MSE of 0.0903. As a result, the
   blast engineer can employ GPR as an effective and appropriate method for
   forecasting blast-induced ground vibration.},

Title = {DeepMalaria: Artificial Intelligence Driven Discovery of Potent
   Antiplasmodials},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Antimalarial drugs are becoming less effective due to the emergence of
   drug resistance. Resistance has been reported for all available malaria
   drugs, including artemisinin, thus creating a perpetual need for
   alternative drug candidates. The traditional drug discovery approach of
   high throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries for
   identification of new drug leads is time-consuming and resource
   intensive. While virtual in silico screening is a solution to this
   problem, however, the generalization of the models is not ideal.
   Artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing either structure-based or
   ligand-based approaches, has demonstrated highly accurate performances
   in the field of chemical property prediction. Leveraging the existing
   data, AI would be a suitable alternative to blind-search HTS or
   fingerprint-based virtual screening. The AI model would learn patterns
   within the data and help to search for hit compounds efficiently. In
   this work, we introduce DeepMalaria, a deep-learning based process
   capable of predicting the anti-Plasmodium falciparum inhibitory
   properties of compounds using their SMILES. A graph-based model is
   trained on 13,446 publicly available antiplasmodial hit compounds from
   GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) dataset that are currently being used to find
   novel drug candidates for malaria. We validated this model by predicting
   hit compounds from a macrocyclic compound library and already approved
   drugs that are used for repurposing. We have chosen macrocyclic
   compounds as these ligand-binding structures are underexplored in
   malaria drug discovery. The in silico pipeline for this process also
   consists of additional validation of an in-house independent dataset
   consisting mostly of natural product compounds. Transfer learning from a
   large dataset was leveraged to improve the performance of the deep
   learning model. To validate the DeepMalaria generated hits, we used a
   commonly used SYBR Green I fluorescence assay based phenotypic
   screening. DeepMalaria was able to detect all the compounds with
   nanomolar activity and 87.5\% of the compounds with greater than 50\%
   inhibition. Further experiments to reveal the compounds' mechanism of
   action have shown that not only does one of the hit compounds, DC-9237,
   inhibits all asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum, but is a
   fast-acting compound which makes it a strong candidate for further
   optimization.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of Continuing Education Online Training System
   Based on Artificial Intelligence Algorithm},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {With the continuous development and maturity of artificial intelligence
   algorithms, there are more cross-concepts in continuing education, so
   continuing education has begun to develop on the Internet. The
   continuing education online training system realizes nonreal-time
   teaching methods, breaks the limitations of time and space, solves the
   conflict between continuing education engineering and learning, and
   promotes the sharing of high-quality teaching resources. However, the
   current continuing education online training system has many defects and
   imperfections. For example, many continuing education colleges only
   consider building resources and teaching forms to design online learning
   systems, and these high-quality resources and teaching forms are
   difficult to be effectively utilized. Based on this background, this
   paper establishes a continuing education online training system combined
   with artificial intelligence algorithms, which is divided into course
   management, question bank management, learning management, homework
   management, question-and-answer management, online learning process
   monitoring management, basic data management, system management, etc.
   Then, by matching the relevance of the above courses, individual courses
   are recommended for students to complete the continuing online training
   education. The system has been highly appraised by the majority of
   students. The user said that the system can effectively solve practical
   problems, which is known for the effectiveness of the system design in
   this paper, thus providing reasonable help for improving the teaching
   quality. In this paper, we deeply study artificial intelligence
   algorithms and apply them to the field of continuing education to design
   a new type of online education system.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective There has been a large amount of research in the field of
   artificial intelligence (AI) as applied to clinical radiology. However,
   these studies vary in design and quality and systematic reviews of the
   entire field are lacking.This systematic review aimed to identify all
   papers that used deep learning in radiology to survey the literature and
   to evaluate their methods. We aimed to identify the key questions being
   addressed in the literature and to identify the most effective methods
   employed. Methods We followed the PRISMA guidelines and performed a
   systematic review of studies of AI in radiology published from 2015 to
   2019. Our published protocol was prospectively registered. Results Our
   search yielded 11,083 results. Seven hundred sixty-seven full texts were
   reviewed, and 535 articles were included. Ninety-eight percent were
   retrospective cohort studies. The median number of patients included was
   460. Most studies involved MRI (37\%). Neuroradiology was the most
   common subspecialty. Eighty-eight percent used supervised learning. The
   majority of studies undertook a segmentation task (39\%). Performance
   comparison was with a state-of-the-art model in 37\%. The most used
   established architecture was UNet (14\%). The median performance for the
   most utilised evaluation metrics was Dice of 0.89 (range .49-.99), AUC
   of 0.903 (range 1.00-0.61) and Accuracy of 89.4 (range 70.2-100). Of the
   77 studies that externally validated their results and allowed for
   direct comparison, performance on average decreased by 6\% at external
   validation (range increase of 4\% to decrease 44\%). Conclusion This
   systematic review has surveyed the major advances in AI as applied to
   clinical radiology.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) based on convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve
   health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation
   of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine,
   the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic
   interfaces.
   Methods: In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical
   coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular
   degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs
   to perform AMD diagnosis.
   Results: Here, we present an AI-and cloud-based telemedicine interaction
   tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning
   process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same
   image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our
   hospital. The AI platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than
   90\% and was significantly superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical
   students (69.4\% and 68.9\%) and equal (p = 0.99) to that of retinal
   specialists (92.73\% and 91.90\%). Furthermore, it provided appropriate
   treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists.
   Conclusions: We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud
   computing based on this AI platform, available at
   https://www.ym.edu.tw/similar to AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT
   images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require
   treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution
   for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.},

Journal = {NANO TODAY},

Abstract = {As a fundamental security problem, counterfeits pose a tremendous threat
   to public health and social economy. Herein, we exploit multi-functional
   nanoinks made of one-dimensional silicon-based nanohy-brids for
   constructing fluorescent and plasmonic security tags. Of particular
   significance, the presented security solution exhibits triple-layer
   authentication model, simultaneously featuring the advantages of
   physical unclonable functions (PUFs), huge-encoding capacity algorithm
   and artificial intelligence technique. In macroscale, the multi-color
   fluorescence security signals are used as the first layer, which can be
   verified through portable smartphone. In the second security layer, the
   unclonable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) security signals at
   low-level magnification could be visualized using confocal Raman system.
   Taking advantages of coarse grained and quaternary encrypting of signals
   from Raman at each pixel, the encoding capacity reaches 6.43 x
   10(24082), which is much higher than the value (i.e., 3 x 10(15051))
   ever reported. In the third layer, the aggregated SERS signals at
   high-level magnification Raman mapping produce unrepeatable patterns
   with shape-specific information. By further applying specifically
   artificial intelligence (AI), faint features of different SERS images
   are extracted and trained, allowing 98-100\% of recognition accuracy
   after 1000 learning cycles. Such triple-layer security solution ensures
   the PUF5, huge encoding capacity and AI authentication simultaneously,
   providing newly high-performance platform of unbreakable
   anti-counterfeiting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background and aims: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions in
   adolescents based on the percentiles of its components are rather
   complicated to use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to
   test the validity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based scores
   (AI\_METS) that do not use these percentiles for MetS screening for
   adolescents.Methods and results: This study included 1086 adolescents
   aged 12 to 18. The cohort underwent anthropometric measurements and
   blood tests. Mean blood pressure (MBP), and triglyceride glucose index
   (TyG) were calculated. Explainable AI methods are used to extract the
   learned function. Gini importance techniques were tested and used to
   build new scores for the screening of MetS. IDF, Cook, De Ferranti,
   Viner, and Weiss definitions of MetS were used to test the validity of
   these scores.MetS prevalence was 0.4\%-4.7\% according to these
   definitions. AI\_METS used age, waist circumference, MBP, and TyG index.
   They offer area under the curves (AUCs) 0.91, 0.93, 0.89, 0.93, and
   0.98; specificity 81\%, 75\%, 72\%, 80\%, and 97\%; and sensitivity
   90\%, 100\%, 90\%, 100\%, and 100\%, respectively, for the detection of
   MetS according to these definitions. Considering only MBP offers a
   better specificity and sensitivity to detect MetS than considering only
   TyG index. MBP offers slightly lower performance than
   AI\_METS.Conclusion: AI techniques have proven their ability to extract
   knowledge from data. They allowed us to generate new scores for MetS
   detection in adolescents without using specific percentiles for each
   component. Although these scores are less intuitive than the
   percentile-based definition, their accuracy is rather effective for the
   detection of MetS.(c) 2022 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian

Abstract = {Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications,
   including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability
   of large datasets ({''}big data{''}), substantial advances in computing
   power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI
   methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the
   imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature,
   better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program
   use across different imaging platforms and Patient populations. AI
   surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by
   identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs
   can be used to extract ``radiomic{''} information from images not
   discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic
   and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been
   made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue
   has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will
   beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current
   limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing
   power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote
   access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value
   created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better
   outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists.
   AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data.
   Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a
   leading role in medical applications of AI.},

Title = {Gamification as a Growing Trend in Higher Education: Prospects and
   Problems},
Journal = {VOPROSY FILOSOFII},
Year = {2023},
Number = {6},
Pages = {116-123},
Abstract = {The article deals with the phenomenon of gamification and the problems
   of im-plementing game practices in higher education. Based on the
   information about consumer habits, style features of behavior, etc.,
   gamification becomes a fairly effective IT tool that contributes to
   achieving the goals of one or another project by way of constructing
   artificially player motivation, i.e., in fact, programming for a certain
   behavior pattern. The paper notes that the Western trend of mass
   in-clusion of games and game technologies in curricula has become a
   significant reference point for domestic educational policy, and
   gamification is now dis-cussed as a new, alternative way of organizing
   learning in educational institu-tions of our country, which allows to
   significantly influence student behavior and the effectiveness of
   learning outcomes. Analyzing possible consequences and trying to take
   into account the explicit and latent risks, the author concludes that
   the most alarming trend of gamification implementation in the
   educational process is the creation of unprecedented opportunities for
   collecting data on student be-havior in the digital educational space.
   Tracking reactions and psychoemotional state of young people in the
   course of gamified learning, the use of artificial in-telligence
   technologies, neural networks, the use of learning action analysis
   tech-nologies, digital footprint analysis - all these may help to build
   and improve the behavior management strategy required by customers. Here
   we see the pro-spects of making a testing range for large-scale work to
   create additional means of control, standardization and correction with
   the view to improve the tech-niques of manipulating the consciousness
   and behavior of the masses of people. In the author's opinion, the
   transformation of learning into a computer game will promote not only a
   significant deformation of the inner meaning of pedagogics, but also the
   transformation of student youth into an object of various manipu-lations
   using the high-human methodology, which widely applies the tools of
   smart technology.},

   There is a need for a framework of pedagogical model and instructional

Title = {Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer Detection: Scoping Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Skin cancer is the most common cancer type affecting humans.
   Traditional skin cancer diagnosis methods are costly, require a
   professional physician, and take time. Hence, to aid in diagnosing skin
   cancer, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used, including
   shallow and deep machine learning-based methodologies that are trained
   to detect and classify skin cancer using computer algorithms and deep
   neural networks.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and group the different
   types of AI-based technologies used to detect and classify skin cancer.
   The study also examined the reliability of the selected papers by
   studying the correlation between the data set size and the number of
   diagnostic classes with the performance metrics used to evaluate the
   models.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search for papers using Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, Association for
   Computing Machinery Digital Library (ACM DL), and Ovid MEDLINE databases
   following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The
   studies included in this scoping review had to fulfill several selection
   criteria: being specifically about skin cancer, detecting or classifying
   skin cancer, and using AI technologies. Study selection and data
   extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Extracted data
   were narratively synthesized, where studies were grouped based on the
   diagnostic AI techniques and their evaluation metrics.
   Results: We retrieved 906 papers from the 3 databases, of which 53 were
   eligible for this review. Shallow AI-based techniques were used in 14
   studies, and deep AI-based techniques were used in 39 studies. The
   studies used up to 11 evaluation metrics to assess the proposed models,
   where 39 studies used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
   Overall, studies that used smaller data sets reported higher accuracy.
   Conclusions: This paper examined multiple AI-based skin cancer detection
   models. However, a direct comparison between methods was hindered by the
   varied use of different evaluation metrics and image types. Performance
   scores were affected by factors such as data set size, number of
   diagnostic classes, and techniques. Hence, the reliability of shallow
   and deep models with higher accuracy scores was questionable since they
   were trained and tested on relatively small data sets of a few
   diagnostic classes.},

Abstract = {International cooperation in running schools has promoted the scale of
   higher education and trained a number of talents with international
   vision. However, there are many differences between domestic teaching
   and foreign teaching in the international cooperation in running
   schools. This makes it difficult for students to adapt to the teaching
   of foreign universities. Connecting domestic teaching with foreign
   teaching and solving the problem of differentiation has become an
   important issue in international cooperation in running schools. In
   order to improve the quality of international cooperation of high
   education, it is very urgent to design an efficient model of
   international cooperation. We exploit artificial intelligence to design
   a teaching model of international cooperation. We implement the
   effective model of international cooperation in logistics management and
   software technology, where the implementation results show that the
   model can provide learning suggestions of the foreign stage according to
   the learning situation of the domestic stage.},

Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, based on von Neumann
   architecture and classical neural networks, have a number of fundamental
   limitations in comparison with the mammalian brain. In this article we
   discuss these limitations and ways to mitigate them. Next, we present an
   overview of currently available neuromorphic AI projects in which these
   limitations are overcome by bringing some brain features into the
   functioning and organization of computing systems (TrueNorth, Loihi,
   Tianjic, SpiNNaker, BrainScaleS, NeuronFlow, DYNAP, Akida, Mythic).
   Also, we present the principle of classifying neuromorphic AI systems by
   the brain features they use: connectionism, parallelism, asynchrony,
   impulse nature of information transfer, on-device-learning, local
   learning, sparsity, analog, and in-memory computing. In addition to
   reviewing new architectural approaches used by neuromorphic devices
   based on existing silicon microelectronics technologies, we also discuss
   the prospects for using a new memristor element base. Examples of recent
   advances in the use of memristors in neuromorphic applications are also
   given.},

Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {173},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the continuous development of society, people's life pressure is
   constantly increasing, and the mental health problems of college
   students are becoming increasingly prominent, bringing many challenges
   to their education and management. Universities should not only
   cultivate students' theoretical and professional knowledge and practical
   skills, but also attach importance to their mental health and
   effectively implement psychological education. Therefore, it is very
   necessary to develop and design a simple and effective student
   psychological evaluation system. As a new form of ideological and
   political transformation in universities in the era of big data, online
   ideological and political work has potential development space. It is
   necessary to carry out mental health education in universities, fully
   utilize online education forms, and improve ability of universities to
   repair mental health problems. Based on this, this system designs and
   implements software for typical image resolution based recognition and
   artificial intelligence. The use of B/S architecture in the development
   and use of. net technology and web server technology will enable more
   students to connect and use different terminals. In addition, an
   algorithm for image super-resolution recognition was proposed, which
   uses clustering convolution to improve residual blocks, improves
   modeling ability by extracting features on a larger scale, reduces the
   number of parameters to improve model calculation efficiency, and
   enables mental health educators and managers to work better. This
   article combines image super-resolution recognition technology with
   artificial intelligence technology to apply it to the process of
   psychological education in universities, thereby promoting the
   development of problem repair applications.},

   intelligence (AI) technology on social ethics is analyzed. Secondly, it
   analyzes the current situation of the cultivation of science and
   engineering college students' entrepreneurship from three aspects:
   Chinese traditional cultural thoughts influence the concept of career
   choice, enterprises emphasize utilitarianism, and colleges and
   universities attach importance to knowledge education and despise
   spiritual education. Finally, the data statistics on the cultivation of
   entrepreneurship of science and engineering college students are carried
   out in the form of questionnaires. The results demonstrate that among
   the students surveyed, 21.31\% have a strong willingness to start their
   own business, and 72.84\% have the idea of starting their own business,
   which means that most students still want to start a business through
   their own efforts, not blindly looking for jobs. Simultaneously, among
   many majors, 87.5\% of students majoring in agriculture and medicine are
   better at finding new ways to solve problems, while the proportion of
   students majoring in literature and history is the lowest. It also
   indicates that most students believe that schools should add more
   seminar courses, internship courses, design courses, experimental
   courses, etc., and allow students to choose learning courses across
   colleges and majors, to cultivate college students' entrepreneurship.
   The proposed method provides some ideas for the application of AI
   technology in the cultivation of students' entrepreneurship.},

   software and bring a new learning experience for the teaching evaluation
   of the education system in colleges and universities. The fuzzy logic
   theory is applied to the teaching evaluation system of higher learning
   pedagogy, according to pedagogy and other related theories, combined
   with the current teaching evaluation indicators of colleges and
   universities, the teaching evaluation indicators of higher learning
   education are set according to certain requirements. The sample wood
   data is divided into two parts by using the fuzzy logic principle, and
   the training model is obtained by training the sample data in the

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to describe and assess the current stage of the
   artificial intelligence (AI) technology integration in preventive
   orthopaedics of the knee and hip joints.
   Materials and methods The study was conducted in strict compliance with
   the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis
   (PRISMA) statement. Literature databases were searched for articles
   describing the development and validation of AI models aimed at
   diagnosing knee or hip joint pathologies or predicting their development
   or course in patients. The quality of the included articles was assessed
   using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)
   and QUADAS-AI tools.
   Results 56 articles were found that meet all the inclusion criteria. We
   identified two problems that block the full integration of AI into the
   routine of an orthopaedic physician. The first of them is related to the
   insufficient amount, variety and quality of data for training, and
   validation and testing of AI models. The second problem is the rarity of
   rational evaluation of models, which is why their real quality cannot
   always be evaluated.
   Conclusion The vastness and relevance of the studied topic are beyond
   doubt. Qualitative and optimally validated models exist in all four
   scopes considered. Additional optimization and confirmation of the
   models' quality on various datasets are the last technical stumbling
   blocks for creating usable software and integrating them into the
   routine of an orthopaedic physician.},

Abstract = {This article presents the first-ever big data study of the student
   evaluation of teaching (SET) using artificial intelligence (AI). We
   train natural language processing (NLP) models on 1.6 million student
   evaluations from the US and the UK. We address two research questions:
   (1) are these models able to predict student ratings from the student
   textual feedback, and (2) can AI-powered SET eliminate the problems of
   the traditional SET based on Likert scale surveys. We test these NLP
   models on a new dataset of 12,386 university reviews from the UK and on
   155 SET reviews from a university that agreed to run a pilot AI project.
   The trained NLP models exhibited high prediction accuracy, and they
   learnt two biases from humans, those of extreme responding and assigning
   higher ratings to less demanding courses. In the future, universities
   will likely adopt many AI-based tools that have proved successful in
   client management in other sectors. However, our results make a strong
   case against using AI as a black box for performativity purposes. It
   should remain a useful tool for university administrators who are aware
   of the AI weaknesses documented here.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing an
   opportunity to enhance existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to
   improve patient safety and drive value-based imaging. We discuss the
   advantages and potential applications that may be realized with the
   synergy between AI and CDS systems. From the perspective of both
   radiologist and ordering provider, CDS could be significantly empowered
   using AI. CDS enhanced by AI could reduce friction in radiology
   workflows and can aid AI developers to identify relevant imaging
   features their tools should be seeking to extract from images.
   Furthermore, these systems can generate structured data to be used as
   input to develop machine learning algorithms, which can drive downstream
   care pathways. For referring providers, an AI-enabled CDS solution could
   enable an evolution from existing imaging-centric CDS toward decision
   support that takes into account a holistic patient perspective. More
   intelligent CDS could suggest imaging examinations in highly complex
   clinical scenarios, assist on the identification of appropriate imaging
   opportunities at the health system level, suggest appropriate
   individualized screening, or aid health care providers to ensure
   continuity of care. AI has the potential to enable the next generation
   of CDS, improving patient care and enhancing providers' and
   radiologists' experience.},

Abstract = {The use of intelligent college English writing training system will
   certainly promote the traditional teaching structure and realize a new

   Moreover, in view of the shortcomings of traditional models and the
   characteristics of intelligent English writing, this paper proposes an
   improved algorithm for optimization of swarm particle walking paths. In
   addition, this article proposes a relative attractiveness to initialize
   the formation of small-scale groups based on the herd effect. Then, in
   the process of intelligent writing, by establishing an information
   sharing mechanism between groups, each group is continuously updated and
   reorganized according to the relative attractiveness of the group, so
   that the writing process can be simulated more realistically. From the
   experimental research, it can be seen that the model constructed in this

Abstract = {Nowadays, with the continuous change and innovation of teaching methods
   in Colleges and universities, the curriculum system of students is also
   constantly enriched and developed. Therefore, people's requirements for
   teaching management and teaching system are also improving. Physical
   education curriculum is usually based on outdoor teaching, and some
   schools have not established a complete teaching system. Therefore, the
   interactive teaching system of physical training based on artificial

   corresponding circuit address decoding, improve the audio control
   circuit, associated video connection interactive drive three parts, the
   intelligent sports training interactive system hardware design. Then,
   through the creation of intelligent training function module, the design
   of training database and the realisation of effective training and
   teaching of intelligent sports, the software design of intelligent
   sports training interactive system is carried out. Finally, through the
   test of the system, to verify the corresponding effect, further improve

   defects. The results obtained from the sensors require the application
   of case-specific AI techniques aimed at improving the acquired
   high-dimensional dataset's understanding, as well as classification and
   prediction. It is evident that the coupling of AI technique and sensors
   have shown promising outcome between 81.2 and 100\% range of accuracy in
   adulteration and defect detection for food and agricultural product. The
   research trends and guidelines are also proposed with the aim to provide
   references and guidance to both scientific researchers and industrial
   players in the field of food and agriculture quality assessment. The
   challenges and prospects regarding AI techniques were also revealed.
   Furthermore, future potential developments, new sensors and novel
   algorithms must be pursued and validated. Future AI detection of food
   adulteration and agricultural product defects can be anticipated,
   especially with the integration of various sensors and the application
   of deep learning algorithms. Real-time monitoring and predictive
   modeling may also receive great attention, which could assist to avoid
   quality problems before they arise, lower the risk of fraud, and ensure
   high-valuable products.},

Abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence in education, online
   education has been recognized by the society as a new teaching method.
   It can make full use of the advantages of the network across regions,
   and make full use of the advantages of network technology to share the
   resources of colleges and universities, which is a promising educational
   method. In response to the demand of online education for learner
   information, this paper proposes the learner model Neighbor Mean
   Variation Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm
   (NMVMOPSO-GA). This model includes the learner's learning interest
   sub-model, the learner's cognitive ability sub-model and the learner's
   knowledge sub-model. The modelling techniques of the three sub-models
   are discussed separately, and their status and role in the online
   education system are analyzed. At the same time, for the knowledge model
   that reflects the learner's learning progress and knowledge mastery, a
   learner knowledge sub-model constructed with Bayesian networks is
   proposed. The neighbor mean mutation operator is introduced to optimize
   the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and improve
   the convergence performance and stability of the multi-objective
   particle swarm optimization algorithm. We study the application of
   multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm in online course
   resource generation service. Through simulation experiments, it is
   verified that the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm
   can improve the performance and stability of online course resource
   generation.},

Abstract = {Student success plays a vital role in educational institutions, as it is
   often used as a metric for the institution's performance. Early
   detection of students at risk, along with preventive measures, can
   drastically improve their success. Lately, machine learning techniques
   have been extensively used for prediction purpose. While there is a
   plethora of success stories in the literature, these techniques are
   mainly accessible to ``computer science{''}, or more precisely,
   ``artificial intelligence{''} literate educators. Indeed, the effective
   and efficient application of data mining methods entail many decisions,
   ranging from how to define student's success, through which student
   attributes to focus on, up to which machine learning method is more
   appropriate to the given problem. This study aims to provide a
   step-by-step set of guidelines for educators willing to apply data
   mining techniques to predict student success. For this, the literature
   has been reviewed, and the state-of-the-art has been compiled into a
   systematic process, where possible decisions and parameters are
   comprehensively covered and explained along with arguments. This study
   will provide to educators an easier access to data mining techniques,
   enabling all the potential of their application to the field of

Title = {Analysis of the effect of an artificial intelligence chatbot educational
   program on non-face-to-face classes: a quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundEducation and training are needed for nursing students using
   artificial intelligence-based educational programs. However, few studies
   have assessed the effect of using chatbots in nursing education.
   ObjectivesThis study aimed to develop and examine the effect of an
   artificial intelligence chatbot educational program for promoting
   nursing skills related to electronic fetal monitoring in nursing college
   students during non-face-to-face classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   DesignThis quasi-experimental study used a nonequivalent control group
   non-synchronized pretest-posttest design. MethodsThe participants were
   61 junior students from a nursing college located in G province of South
   Korea. Data were collected between November 3 and 16, 2021, and analyzed
   using independent t-tests. ResultsThe experimental group-in which the
   artificial intelligence chatbot program was applied-did not show
   statistically significant differences in knowledge (t = -0.58, p =
   .567), clinical reasoning competency (t = 0.75, p = .455), confidence (t
   = 1.13, p = .264), and feedback satisfaction (t = 1.72, p = .090),
   compared with the control group; however, its participants' interest in
   education (t = 2.38, p = .020) and self-directed learning (t = 2.72, p =
   .006) were significantly higher than those in the control group.
   ConclusionThe findings of our study highlighted the potential of
   artificial intelligence chatbot programs as an educational assistance
   tool to promote nursing college students' interest in education and
   self-directed learning. Moreover, such programs can be effective in
   enhancing nursing students' skills in non-face-to face-situations caused
   by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {Current challenges and issues are so complex that without a close,
   interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary cooperation it is very difficult
   or even impossible to solve and find innovative approaches to them. We
   are living in the era of big data, artificial intelligence and also
   virtual reality which are changing the paradigm of all our living
   including education. As far as communication within multidisciplinary
   and multinational working teams is concerned, English has become a
   preferable language that is used worldwide including academia and
   research. In non-English speaking countries Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs) have faced very similar challenge how to foster
   establishing English Education Environment (EEE). Most of their students
   speak different language and their level of English competence differs.
   Likewise, disciplinary teachers' (DTs') English competence and readiness
   to teach their courses in English vary. This contribution describes the
   project (Visegrad+) of HEIs from Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Albania and
   Serbia, intended to study if Content and Language Integrated Learning
   (CLIL) and close cooperation between ESP/CLIL experts and DTs can result
   in effective English learning-teaching environment. The main project
   outcome - web platform for ESP/ CLIL and DTs communities is presented.
   Finally, as far as interdisciplinary teacher cooperation is concerned,
   some observations during COVID19 pandemic are illustrated.},

Abstract = {Coronaviruses are a well-known family of viruses that can infect humans
   or animals. Recently, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread
   worldwide. All countries in the world are working hard to control the
   coronavirus disease. However, many countries are faced with a lack of
   medical equipment and an insufficient number of medical personnel
   because of the limitations of the medical system, which leads to the
   mass spread of diseases. As a powerful tool, artificial intelligence
   (AI) has been successfully applied to solve various complex problems
   ranging from big data analysis to computer vision. In the process of
   epidemic control, many algorithms are proposed to solve problems in
   various fields of medical treatment, which is able to reduce the
   workload of the medical system. Due to excellent learning ability, AI
   has played an important role in drug development, epidemic forecast, and

Title = {Higher education's role in capacitating retail businesses' well-being,
   resilience and efficiency post-COVID-19},
Journal = {RETAIL AND MARKETING REVIEW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging business confidence and
   sustainability globally. This paper explores the critical role of higher
   education institutions (HEIs) in supporting retail businesses to
   capitalise on the realities of the pandemic. Following a corpus-review
   approach, 147 articles on higher education, COVID-19, and retail that
   were published from January to May 2020 were analysed. A constructivist
   grounded theory approach driven by a data coding process and qualitative
   analysis was adopted to identify underlying concepts for constructing
   appropriate responses. First-level coding identified substantive codes
   that were converted into broader abstract concepts, while a word-tree
   analysis identified the core theme. A series of codes were classified
   into reduced final concepts and dimensions using NVivo 12. Finally, a
   binary similarity index (Jaccard's coefficients) was used to calculate
   the similarities between any two sets of substantive concepts. The
   results revealed three driving forces determining post-COVID-19 retail
   business survival and sustainability: quality, omni-channel retailing,
   and accountable management. The demand for flexible and blended forms of
   life-long learning will require employee up-skilling and re-skilling,
   and has increased the demand for short-term online courses. The future
   of retail businesses will depend more on science and technology that
   focus on the green economy, health and safety, and daily business
   operations. The future of retail relies on big data, artificial
   intelligence and automotive learning devices to act ex ante on expected
   changes in the retail ecosystem. More research is required on how to
   cultivate HEI partnerships to collectively develop a noosphere capacity
   to protect the retail sector from micro and global challenges.},

Abstract = {IntroductionDespite the growing investment in and adoption of artificial
   intelligence (AI) in medicine, the applications of AI in an emergency
   setting remain unclear. This scoping review seeks to identify available
   literature regarding the applications of AI in emergency medicine.
   MethodsThe scoping review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for
   scoping reviews using Medline-OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, and IEEE, with a
   double screening and extraction process. The search included articles
   published until February 28, 2020. Articles were excluded if they did
   not self-classify as studying an AI intervention, were not relevant to
   the emergency department (ED), or did not report outcomes or evaluation.
   ResultsOf the 1483 original database citations, 395 were eligible for
   full-text evaluation. Of these articles, a total of 150 were included in
   the scoping review. The majority of included studies were retrospective
   in nature (n = 124, 82.7\%), with only 3 (2.0\%) prospective controlled
   trials. We found 37 (24.7\%) interventions aimed at improving diagnosis
   within the ED. Among the 150 studies, 19 (12.7\%) focused on diagnostic
   imaging within the ED. A total of 16 (10.7\%) studies were conducted in
   the out-of-hospital environment (eg, emergency medical services,
   paramedics) with the remainder occurring either in the ED or the trauma
   bay. Of the 24 (16\%) studies that had human comparators, there were 12
   (8\%) studies in which AI interventions outperformed clinicians in at
   least 1 measured outcome.
   ConclusionAI-related research is rapidly increasing in emergency
   medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve
   emergency care, particularly for acute radiographic imaging and
   prediction-based diagnoses. Higher quality evidence is needed to further
   assess both short- and long-term clinical outcomes.},

   Recent advances and prospects},
Journal = {BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {370},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) offers several merits such as better
   digestibility and process stability while enhancing methane yield due to
   synergistic effects. Operation of an efficient AcoD system, however,
   requires full comprehension of important operational parameters, such as
   co-substrates ratio, their composition, volatile fatty acids/alkalinity
   ratio, organic loading rate, and solids/hydraulic retention time. AcoD
   process optimization, prediction and control, and early detection of
   system instability are often difficult to achieve through tedious manual
   monitoring processes. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged
   as an innovative approach to computational modeling and optimization of
   the AcoD process. This review discusses AI applications in AcoD process
   optimization, control, prediction of unknown input/output parameters,
   and real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the review also compares
   standalone and hybrid AI algorithms as applied to AcoD. The review
   highlights future research directions for data preprocessing, model
   interpretation and validation, and grey-box modeling in AcoD process.},

Abstract = {Radiologists today are under increasing work pressure. We surveyed
   radiologists in the United States across practice settings, and the
   overwhelming majority reported an increased workload. Artificial
   intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning, can help address
   these issues. It also has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and
   raise further the value of medical imaging in ways yet to be defined. In
   this article, we report on recent McKinsey \& Company work to understand
   the growth of AI in medical imaging. We highlight progress in its
   clinical application, the investments that are backing it, and the
   barriers to broader adoption. We also offer a view on how the market
   will develop. AI is set to have a big impact on the medical imaging
   market and hence on how radiologists work, helping them to speed up scan
   time, make more accurate diagnoses, and ease their workload. As AI in
   medical imaging increasingly proves its worth, it is hard to imagine
   that AI will not ultimately transform radiology.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death among
   infectious diseases worldwide. Early screening and diagnosis of
   pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is crucial in TB control, and tend to
   benefit from artificial intelligence. Here, we aimed to evaluate the
   diagnostic efficacy of a variety of artificial intelligence methods in
   medical imaging for PTB. We searched MEDLINE and Embase with the OVID
   platform to identify trials published update to November 2022 that
   evaluated the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-based software in
   medical imaging of patients with PTB. After data extraction, the quality
   of studies was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy
   studies 2 (QUADAS-2). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated
   using a bivariate random-effects model. In total, 3987 references were
   initially identified and 61 studies were finally included, covering a
   wide range of 124,959 individuals. The pooled sensitivity and the
   specificity were 91\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 89-93\%) and 65\%
   (54-75\%), respectively, in clinical trials, and 94\% (89-96\%) and 95\%
   (91-97\%), respectively, in model-development studies. These findings
   have demonstrated that artificial-intelligence-based software could
   serve as an accurate tool to diagnose PTB in medical imaging. However,
   standardized reporting guidance regarding AI-specific trials and
   multicenter clinical trials is urgently needed to truly transform this
   cutting-edge technology into clinical practice.},

   (SPECT) imaging: a narrative review},
Journal = {ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely applied to medical imaging.
   The use of AI for emission computed tomography, particularly
   single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) emerged nearly 30
   years ago but has been accelerated in recent years due to the
   development of AI technology. In this review, we will describe and
   discuss the progress of AI technology in SPECT imaging. The applications
   of AI are dispersed in disease prediction and diagnosis,
   post-reconstruction image denoising, attenuation map generation, and
   image reconstruction. These applications are relevant to many disease
   categories such as the neurological disorders, kidney failure, cancer,
   heart disease, etc. This review summarizes these applications so that
   SPECT researchers can have a reference overview of the role of AI in
   current SPECT studies. For each application, we followed the timeline to
   present the evolution of AI's usage and offered insights on how AI was
   combined with the knowledge of underlying physics as well as traditional
   non-learning techniques. Ultimately, AI applications are critical to the
   progress of modern SPECT technology because they provide compensations
   for many deficiencies in conventional SPECT imaging methods and
   demonstrate unparalleled success. Nonetheless, AI also has its own
   challenges and limitations in the medical field, including SPECT
   imaging. These fundamental questions are discussed, and possible future
   directions and countermeasures are suggested.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY},

Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1077-1082},

Abstract = {The increasingly realistic prospect of artificial intelligence (AI)
   playing an important role in radiology has been welcomed with a mixture
   of enthusiasm and anxiousness. A consensus has arisen that AI will
   support radiologists in the interpretation of less challenging cases,
   which will give the radiologists more time to focus on the challenging
   tasks as well as interactions with patients and other clinicians. The
   possibility of AI replacing a large number of radiologists is generally
   dismissed by the radiology community. The common arguments include the
   following: (1) AI will never be able to match radiologists' performance;
   (2) radiologists do more than interpret images; (3) even if AI takes
   over a large portion of the reading tasks, the radiologists' effort will
   be shifted toward interactions with patients and other physicians; (4)
   the FDA would never agree to let machines do the work of radiologist;
   (5) the issues of legal liability would be insurmountable; and (6)
   patients would never put complete trust in computer algorithms. In this
   article, I analyze these arguments in detail. I find a certain level of
   validity to some of them. However, I conclude that none of the arguments
   provide sufficient support for the claim that AI will not create a
   significant disruption in the radiology workforce. Such disruption is a
   real possibility. Although the radiology specialty has shown an
   astonishing ability to adapt to the changing technology, the future is
   uncertain, and an honest, in-depth discussion is needed to guide
   development of the field.},

   cycle of wells using artificial intelligence methods, in particular,
   helps to improve the efficiency of drilling oil and gas wells. In the
   course of creating and training artificial neural networks, regularities
   were modeled with a given accuracy, hidden relationships between
   geological and geophysical, technical and technological parameters were
   revealed. The clustering of multidimensional data volumes from various
   types of sensors used to measure parameters during well drilling has
   been carried out. Artificial intelligence classification models have
   been developed to predict the operational results of the well
   construction. The analysis of these issues is carried out, and the main

Abstract = {With the continuous development of society, work pressure and study
   pressure are increasingly becoming the key factors affecting people's
   physical and mental health, especially for college students, good
   knowledge and skills as well as superior psychological quality are the
   important factors for them to become excellent talents. As an important
   factor affecting people's psychological quality, mental health has been
   paid more and more attention by people. The effect of traditional mental
   health education in daily education activities is not very obvious,
   which cannot achieve a profound impact on people's mental health
   training and development. In this paper, based on the artificial
   intelligence online technology, an expert system of mental health
   education and daily consultation is designed. The system mainly
   integrates four application modules: psychological knowledge learning,
   psychological daily evaluation, psychological expert consultation and
   personal personalized management. The experiment shows that the
   artificial intelligence online expert consultation system designed in
   this paper can query daily psychological problems conveniently and
   quickly. At the same time, the treatment of human psychological problems
   can be realized through the intelligent online psychological counselling
   and the relief of psychological symptoms. The artificial intelligence
   online mental health education system has obvious practical value and
   social significance.},

Title = {Potential of Artificial Intelligence-Based Techniques for Rainfall
   Forecasting in Thailand: A Comprehensive Review},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rainfall forecasting is one of the most challenging factors of weather
   forecasting all over the planet. Due to climate change, Thailand has
   experienced extreme weather events, including prolonged lacks of and
   heavy rainfall. Accurate rainfall forecasting is crucial for Thailand's
   agricultural sector. Agriculture depends on rainfall water, which is
   important for water resources, adversity management, and overall
   socio-economic development. Artificial intelligence techniques (AITs)
   have shown remarkable precision in rainfall forecasting in the past two
   decades. AITs may accurately forecast rainfall by identifying hidden
   patterns from past weather data features. This research investigates and
   reviews the most recent AITs focused on advanced machine learning (ML),
   artificial neural networks (ANNs), and deep learning (DL) utilized for
   rainfall forecasting. For this investigation, academic articles from
   credible online search libraries published between 2000 and 2022 are
   analyzed. The authors focus on Thailand and the worldwide applications
   of AITs for rainfall forecasting and determine the best methods for
   Thailand. This will assist academics in analyzing the most recent work
   on rainfall forecasting, with a particular emphasis on AITs, but it will
   also serve as a benchmark for future comparisons. The investigation
   concludes that hybrid models combining ANNs with wavelet transformation
   and bootstrapping can improve the current accuracy of rainfall
   forecasting in Thailand.},

Abstract = {Environmental emissions, global warming, and energy-related concerns
   have accelerated the advancements in conventional vehicles that
   primarily use internal combustion engines. Among the existing
   technologies, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and fuel cell hybrid
   electric vehicles may have minimal contributions to greenhouse gas
   emissions and thus are the prime choices for environmental concerns.
   However, energy management in fuel cell electric vehicles and fuel cell
   hybrid electric vehicles is a major challenge. Appropriate control
   strategies should be used for effective energy management in these
   vehicles. On the other hand, there has been significant progress in
   artificial intelligence, machine learning, and designing data-driven
   intelligent controllers. These techniques have found much attention
   within the community, and state-of-the-art energy management
   technologies have been developed based on them. This manuscript reviews
   the application of machine learning and intelligent controllers for
   prediction, control, energy management, and vehicle to everything (V2X)
   in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The effectiveness of data-driven control
   and optimization systems are investigated to evolve, classify, and
   compare, and future trends and directions for sustainability are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Due to the fast development of medical imaging technologies, medical
   image analysis has entered the period of big data for proper disease
   diagnosis. At the same time, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) becomes a
   serious disease which affects the injury of blood vessels in the brain
   regions. This paper presents an artificial intelligence and big data
   analytics-based ICH e-diagnosis (AIBDA-ICH) model using CT images. The
   presented model utilizes IoMT devices for data acquisition process. The
   presented AIBDA-ICH model involves graph cut-based segmentation model
   for identifying the affected regions in the CT images. To manage big
   data, Hadoop Ecosystem and its elements are mainly used. In addition,
   capsule network (CapsNet) model is applied as a feature extractor to
   derive a useful set of feature vectors. Finally, the presented AIBDA-ICH
   model makes use of the fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) model to carry
   out classification process. For validating the superior performance of
   the AIBDA-ICH method, an extensive set of simulations were performed and
   the outcomes are examined under diverse aspects. The experimental values
   pointed out the improved e-diagnostic performance of the AIBDA-ICH model
   over the other compared methods with the precision and accuracy of
   94.96\% and 98.59\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {Perioperative medicine is a patient-centered, multidisciplinary and
   integrated clinical practice that starts from the moment of
   contemplation of surgery until full recovery. Every perioperative phase
   (preoperative. intraoperative and postoperative) must be studied and
   planned in order to optimize the entire patient management.
   Perioperative optimization does not only concern a short-term outcome
   improvement, but it has also a strong impact on long term survival.
   Clinical cases variability leads to the collection and analysis of a
   huge amount of different data, coming from multiple sources, making
   perioperative management standardization very difficult. Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) can play a primary role in this challenge, helping
   human mind in perioperative practice planning and decision-making
   process. AI refers to the ability of a computer system to perform
   functions and reasoning typical of the human mind; Machine Learning (ML)
   could play a fundamental role in presurgical planning, during
   intraoperative phase and postoperative management. Perioperative
   medicine is the cornerstone of surgical patient management and the tools
   deriving from the application of AI seem very promising as a support in
   optimizing the management of each individual patient. Despite the
   increasing help that derive from the use of AI tools, the uniqueness of
   the patient and the particularity of each individual clinical case will
   always keep the role of the human mind central in clinical and
   perioperative management. The role of the physician, who must analyze
   the outputs provided by AI by following his own experience and
   knowledge, remains and will always be essential.},

Abstract = {Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women.
   Given accumulating evidence on sex- and gender-based differences in
   cardiovascular disease development and outcomes, the need for more
   effective approaches to screening for risk factors and phenotypes in
   women is ever urgent. Public health surveillance and health care
   delivery systems now continuously generate massive amounts of data that
   could be leveraged to enable both screening of cardiovascular risk and
   implementation of tailored preventive interventions across a woman's
   life span. However, health care providers, clinical guidelines
   committees, and health policy experts are not yet sufficiently equipped
   to optimize the collection of data on women, use or interpret these
   data, or develop approaches to targeting interventions. Therefore, we
   provide a broad overview of the key opportunities for cardiovascular
   screening in women while highlighting the potential applications of
   artificial intelligence along with digital technologies and tools.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) is increasingly used in Education to set
   prediction models from artificial intelligence to determine learning
   profiles. This study aims to determining to what extent K-nearest
   neighbor and random forest algorithms could become a useful tool for
   improving the teaching-learning process and reducing academic failure in
   two Physics courses at the Technological Institute of Monterrey, Mexico
   (n = 268). A quasi-experimental and mixed method approach was conducted.
   The main results showed significant differences between the first and
   second term evaluations in the two groups. One of the main findings of
   the study is that the predictions were not very accurate for each
   student in the first term evaluation. However, the predictions became
   more accurate as the algorithm was fed with larger datasets from the
   second term evaluation. This result indicates how predictive algorithms
   based on decision trees, can offer a close approximation to the academic
   performance that will occur in the class, and this information could be
   use along with the personal impressions coming from the teacher.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in applying
   artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the field of radiology.
   Currently, numerous AI applications are in development, with potential
   benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain from test ordering to
   report communication. AI has been proposed as a means to optimize
   patient scheduling, improve worklist management, enhance image
   acquisition, and help radiologists interpret diagnostic studies.
   Although the potential for AI in radiology appears almost endless, the
   field is still in the early stages, with many uses still theoretical, in
   development, or limited to single institutions. Moreover, although the
   current use of AI in radiology has emphasized its clinical applications,
   some of which are in the distant future, it is increasingly clear that
   AI algorithms could also be used in the more immediate future for a
   variety of noninterpretive and quality improvement uses. Such uses
   include the integration of AI into electronic health record systems to
   reduce unwarranted variation in radiologists' follow-up recommendations
   and to improve other dimensions of radiology report quality. In the end,
   the potential of AI in radiology must be balanced with acknowledgment of
   its current limitations regarding generalizability and data privacy.},

   two phases: phase I builds collective decision rules from teachers'
   preferences, and phase II classifies students into two decision classes:
   `atrisk students' and `leader students'. This method was designed,
   tested, and validated in higher education, with teachers who have

Abstract = {Currently, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology,
   particularly machine learning (ML), has become a reality in clinical
   practice. Since the end of the last century, several ML algorithms have
   been introduced for a wide range of common imaging tasks, not only for
   diagnostic purposes but also for image acquisition and postprocessing.
   AI is now recognized to be a driving initiative in every aspect of
   radiology. There is growing evidence of the advantages of AI in
   radiology creating seamless imaging workflows for radiologists or even
   replacing radiologists. Most of the current AI methods have some
   internal and external disadvantages that are impeding their ultimate
   implementation in the clinical arena. As such, AI can be considered a
   portion of a business trying to be introduced in the health care market.
   For this reason, this review analyzes the current status of AI, and
   specifically ML, applied to radiology from the scope of strengths,
   weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis.},

Title = {Korean dental hygiene students' perceptions and attitudes toward
   artificial intelligence: An online survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {87},
Number = {6},
Pages = {804-812},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {ObjectivesThis study investigated Korean dental hygiene students'
   perceptions and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and aimed
   to identify needs for education to strengthen professional competencies.
   MethodsA 24-question online survey was conducted to the dental hygiene
   students from four Korean schools in 2021. The questionnaire included
   seven questions on basic characteristics and 17 AI-related questions on
   the student's attitudes toward AI, the confidence in AI, predictions
   about AI, and its future prospects. Responses were analyzed according to
   the frequencies and correlations between the participants' subjective
   level of knowledge about AI and questions using chi-square test.
   ResultsInvitations were sent out to 1310 students and 800 (61.1\%)
   participated. Note that 44.2\% of participants were interested in AI,
   and 93.1\% accessed AI-related information through the internet.
   Participants expressed lower confidence in AI's diagnosis (14.8\%) and
   judgment (8.1\%) than in those of humans, and 21.9\% believed AI would
   replace their job. The proportions of participants with positive
   perceptions of the usefulness and the potential for improvement of AI in
   dentistry were 65.5\% and 55.4\%, respectively. Participants from
   schools who had existing AI knowledge expressed higher demands for
   AI-related content as compared to those who did not (p < 0.05).
   ConclusionAlthough dental hygiene students expressed low level of
   confidence in AI, they were interested in AI and had positive views of
   its application and potential for improvement. However, the fact they
   had little AI-related information from dental hygiene curriculum
   strongly suggests the need for AI-related lectures in schools to prepare
   for the future.},

Title = {Economic Impact of Artificial Intelligence: New Look for the

Abstract = {Objective: To determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on
   the selected economies in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: This
   secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific
   data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included
   digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The
   focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business
   operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of
   international organizations' including the World Economic Forum, the
   Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World
   Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International
   Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19
   economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected
   economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between
   2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents
   on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish
   over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order
   include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such,
   this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and
   Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their
   higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI
   research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher
   number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals.
   Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998-2016 with annual
   observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were
   presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the
   future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while
   empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At
   second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings
   with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third,
   other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index
   and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in
   current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies.
   Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main
   driver of Asia-Pacific's economic growth. Relative to the net and gross
   effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of
   the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield
   a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of
   \$13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared
   to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the
   availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can
   move ahead-given better resource and talent allocation. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {The Hippocratic oath and the Belmont report articulate foundational
   principles for how physicians interact with patients and research
   subjects. The increasing use of big data and artificial intelligence
   techniques demands a re-examination of these principles in light of the

   informed consent, epistemology, and inequities. Patients have strong
   opinions about these issues. Radiologists have a fiduciary
   responsibility to protect the interest of their patients. As such, the
   community of radiology leaders, ethicists, and informaticists must have
   a conversation about the appropriate way to deal with these issues and

Abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence Writing Evaluation system is widely used in
   China College English writing. It provides for both teachers and the
   English learners services of automated composition evaluation on the net
   in order that teacher's working load can be reduced and they can learn
   directly about the students' English writing level and that the
   students' English writing will be improved. Juku automated writing
   evaluation (AWE) is one of the most used systems among colleges and
   universities in China. The empirical study was conducted on the use of
   Juku AWE in college English teaching. Through the experiment with 114
   students from 2 classes in Xi'an University and questionnaires and
   interview for both 30 teachers and 200 students using Juku AWE, the
   author finds that: (1) Using AWE does effectively help the students with
   their English writing; (2) Both teachers and students have positive
   attitude to the use of AWE in terms of immediate and clear feedback,
   time-saving, and arousing interests in English writing; and (3) AWE
   still needs to be perfected as it cannot provide proper evaluation on
   the text structure, content logic, and coherence. So both teachers and
   students should take the score from AWE objectively.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe large number of clinical variables associated with
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection makes it challenging for
   frontline physicians to effectively triage COVID-19 patients during the
   pandemic. This study aimed to develop an efficient deep-learning
   artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable
   predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help
   clinicians triage COVID-19 patients.
   MethodsThis retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients
   with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21,
   2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was
   mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and
   laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78
   clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification
   score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into
   85\% training and 15\% testing. Prediction performance was compared with
   those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score, and pneumonia
   severity index (PSI).
   ResultsOf the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five
   top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O-2 Index,
   neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate
   dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score
   yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 (95\% CI =
   0.87-1.0) and 0.954 (95\% CI = 0.80-0.99) for the testing dataset. Our
   models outperformed COVID-19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB-65 score
   (AUC = 0.671), and PSI (AUC = 0.838). The mortality rates for our risk
   stratification scores (0-5) were 0\%, 0\%, 6.7\%, 18.2\%, 67.7\%, and
   83.3\%, respectively.
   ConclusionsDeep-learning prediction model and the resultant risk
   stratification score may prove useful in clinical decisionmaking under
   time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.},

   in the areas of malware identification and classification, intrusion
   detection, and cybercrime prevention. We should, however, be aware that
   AI-enabled cybersecurity is not without its drawbacks. Challenges to AI
   solutions include a shortage of good quality data to train machine
   learning models, the potential for exploits via adversarial AI/ML, and
   limited human expertise in AI. However, the rewards in terms of
   increased accuracy of cyberattack predictions, faster response to
   cyberattacks, and improved cybersecurity make it worthwhile to overcome
   these challenges. We present a summary of the current research on the

Abstract = {Currently, private universities, as a result of the pandemic that the
   world is facing, are going through very delicate moments in several
   areas, both academic and financial. Academically, there are learning
   problems and these are directly related to the dropout rate, which
   brings financial problems. Added to this are the economic problems
   caused by the pandemic, where the rates of students who want to access a
   private education have dropped considerably. For this reason, it is
   necessary for all private universities to have support to improve their
   student income and avoid cuts in budgets and resources. However, the
   academic part represents a great effort to fulfill their academic
   activities, which are the priority, with attention on those interested
   in pursuing a training programs. To solve these problems, it is
   important to integrate technologies such as Chatbots, which use
   artificial intelligence in such a way that tasks such as providing
   information on an academic courses are addressed by them, reducing the
   administrative burden and improving the user experience. At the same
   time, this encourages people to be a part of the college.},

Abstract = {Automated artificial intelligence (AI) systems enable the integration of
   different types of data from various sources for clinical
   decision-making. The aim of this study is to propose a pipeline to
   develop a fully automated clinician-friendly AI-enabled database
   platform for breast cancer survival prediction. A case study of breast
   cancer survival cohort from the University Malaya Medical Centre was
   used to develop and evaluate the pipeline. A relational database and a
   fully automated system were developed by integrating the database with
   analytical modules (machine learning, automated scoring for quality of
   life, and interactive visualization). The developed pipeline, iSurvive
   has helped in enhancing data management as well as to visualize
   important prognostic variables and survival rates. The embedded
   automated scoring module demonstrated quality of life of patients
   whereas the interactive visualizations could be used by clinicians to
   facilitate communication with patients. The pipeline proposed in this
   study is a one-stop center to manage data, to automate analytics using
   machine learning, to automate scoring and to produce explainable
   interactive visuals to enhance clinician-patient communication along the
   survivorship period to modify behaviours that relate to prognosis. The
   pipeline proposed can be modelled on any disease not limited to breast
   cancer.},

Abstract = {In higher education, low teacher-student ratios can make it difficult
   for students to receive immediate and interactive help. Chatbots,
   increasingly used in various scenarios such as customer service, work
   productivity, and healthcare, might be one way of helping instructors
   better meet student needs. However, few empirical studies in the field
   of Information Systems (IS) have investigated pedagogical chatbot
   efficacy in higher education and fewer still discuss their potential
   challenges and drawbacks. In this research we address this gap in the IS
   literature by exploring the opportunities, challenges, efficacy, and
   ethical concerns of using chatbots as pedagogical tools in business
   education. In this two study project, we conducted a chatbot-guided
   interview with 215 undergraduate students to understand student
   attitudes regarding the potential benefits and challenges of using
   chatbots as intelligent student assistants. Our findings revealed the
   potential for chatbots to help students learn basic content in a
   responsive, interactive, and confidential way. Findings also provided
   insights into student learning needs which we then used to design and
   develop a new, experimental chatbot assistant to teach basic AI concepts
   to 195 students. Results of this second study suggest chatbots can be
   engaging and responsive conversational learning tools for teaching basic
   concepts and for providing educational resources. Herein, we provide the
   results of both studies and discuss possible promising opportunities and
   ethical implications of using chatbots to support inclusive learning.},

Abstract = {The authors develop a three-stage framework for strategic marketing
   planning, incorporating multiple artificial intelligence (AI) benefits:
   mechanical AI for automating repetitive marketing functions and
   activities, thinking AI for processing data to arrive at decisions, and
   feeling AI for analyzing interactions and human emotions. This framework
   lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy
   (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the
   marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection,
   thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer
   understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can
   be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for
   targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning
   (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be
   used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling
   AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of
   marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic
   use of AI.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Harnessing big data to predict

Abstract = {BACKGROUND
   Oral cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Public
   knowledge in oral cancer risk factors and survival is limited.
   AIM
   To come up with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the length
   of survival for individuals diagnosed with oral cancer, and to explore
   the most important factors that were responsible for shortening or
   lengthening oral cancer survival.
   METHODS
   We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from
   the years 1975 to 2016 that consisted of a total of 257880 cases and 94
   variables. Four ML techniques in the area of artificial intelligence
   were applied for model training and validation. Model accuracy was
   evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE),
   root mean squared error (RMSE), R-2 and adjusted R-2.
   RESULTS
   The most important factors predictive of oral cancer survival time were
   age at diagnosis, primary cancer site, tumor size and year of diagnosis.
   Year of diagnosis referred to the year when the tumor was first
   diagnosed, implying that individuals with tumors that were diagnosed in
   the modern era tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in the
   past. The extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms showed the best
   performance, with the MAE equaled to 13.55, MSE 486.55 and RMSE 22.06.
   CONCLUSION
   Using artificial intelligence, we developed a tool that can be used for
   oral cancer survival prediction and for medical-decision making. The
   finding relating to the year of diagnosis represented an important new
   discovery in the literature. The results of this study have implications
   for cancer prevention and education for the public.},

Title = {Environmental Justice and the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Urban
   Air Pollution Monitoring},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The main aims of urban air pollution monitoring are to optimize the
   interaction between humanity and nature, to combine and integrate
   environmental databases, and to develop sustainable approaches to the
   production and the organization of the urban environment. One of the
   main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure
   assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and
   machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution
   models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and
   health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to
   estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The
   correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is
   important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it
   concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should
   efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective
   data integration and management are a key to the successful application
   of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we
   consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome
   current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global
   approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach
   can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have
   access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful
   regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current
   complicated operating conditions, as well as taking into account the
   time, computing power, and constraints in the context of environmental
   injustice.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence Using Open Source BI-RADS Data Exemplifying
   Potential Future Use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {64-72},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives: With much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) rendering
   radiologists redundant, a simple radiologist-augmented AI workflow is
   evaluated; the premise is that inclusion of a radiologist's opinion into
   an AI algorithm would make the algorithm achieve better accuracy than an
   algorithm trained on imaging parameters alone. Open-source BI-RADS data
   sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist's opinion
   (in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters
   improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine
   learning algorithms vis-a-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.
   Materials and Methods: BI-RADS data sets were obtained from the
   University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set
   1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data
   set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold
   cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion
   shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture
   parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters
   and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under
   the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the
   validation data set.
   Results: The models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS
   classification performed significantly better than the models not using
   them (P < .0001).
   Conclusion: AI and radiologist working together can achieve better
   results, helping in case-based decision making. Further evaluation of
   the metrics involved in predictor handling by AI algorithms will provide
   newer insights into imaging.},

Abstract = {This paper based on the algorithm of particle swarm optimization neural
   network, the university English classroom training framework with
   artificial intelligence is researched and designed, and a personalized
   learning path based on an improved binary particle swarm algorithm based
   on the non-linear increase of inertial weights and the exploration of

   algorithm's convergence speed and convergence accuracy. It is easy to
   jump out of the local optimum through the improvement of the algorithm,
   thereby solving the problem of low recommendation accuracy of the
   personalized learning path and improving the recommendation efficiency.
   To verify the recommended effect of the model and algorithm, this paper
   designs a simulation experiment and a learning platform that take the
   college English course as an example to verify the running performance
   and practical application effect of the proposed method. The above
   experiments show that the proposed method can improve the matching

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Based Chatbot for Anxiety and Depression in
   University Students: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are emerging as
   instruments of psychological intervention; however, no relevant studies
   have been reported in Latin America.
   Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the
   viability, acceptability, and potential impact of using Tess, a chatbot,
   for examining symptoms of depression and anxiety in university students.
   Methods: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. The experimental
   condition used Tess for 8 weeks, and the control condition was assigned
   to a psychoeducation book on depression. Comparisons were conducted
   using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests for depressive symptoms, and
   independent and paired sample t tests to analyze anxiety symptoms.
   Results: The initial sample consisted of 181 Argentinian college
   students (158, 87.2\% female) aged 18 to 33. Data at week 8 were
   provided by 39 out of the 99 (39\%) participants in the experimental
   condition and 34 out of the 82 (41\%) in the control group. On an
   average, 472 (SD 249.52) messages were exchanged, with 116 (SD 73.87) of
   the messages sent from the users in response to Tess. A higher number of
   messages exchanged with Tess was associated with positive feedback
   (F-2,(36)=4.37; P=.02). No significant differences between the
   experimental and control groups were found from the baseline to week 8
   for depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, significant intragroup
   differences demonstrated that the experimental group showed a
   significant decrease in anxiety symptoms; no such differences were
   observed for the control group. Further, no significant intragroup
   differences were found for depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: The students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging
   messages with Tess and positive feedback was associated with a higher
   number of messages exchanged. The initial results show promising
   evidence for the usability and acceptability of Tess in the Argentinian
   population. Research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and
   further research is needed.},

Abstract = {Background and Aim Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate
   diagnostic modality for polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (GB), but is
   limited by subjective interpretation. Deep learning-based artificial
   intelligence (AI) algorithms are under development. We evaluated the
   diagnostic performance of AI in differentiating polypoid lesions using
   EUS images. Methods The diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI system with
   ResNet50 architecture was evaluated via three processes: training,
   internal validation, and testing using an AI development cohort of 1039
   EUS images (836 GB polyps and 203 gallstones). The diagnostic
   performance was verified using an external validation cohort of 83
   patients and compared with the performance of EUS endoscopists. Results
   In the AI development cohort, we developed an EUS-AI algorithm and
   evaluated the diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI including
   sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
   value, and accuracy. For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and
   non-neoplastic GB polyps, these values for EUS-AI were 57.9\%, 96.5\%,
   77.8\%, 91.6\%, and 89.8\%, respectively. In the external validation
   cohort, we compared diagnostic performances between EUS-AI and
   endoscopists. For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and
   non-neoplastic GB polyps, the sensitivity and specificity were 33.3\%
   and 96.1\% for EUS-AI; they were 74.2\% and 44.9\%, respectively, for
   the endoscopists. Besides, the accuracy of the EUS-AI was between the
   accuracies of mid-level (66.7\%) and expert EUS endoscopists (77.5\%).
   Conclusions This newly developed EUS-AI system showed favorable
   performance for the diagnosis of neoplastic GB polyps, with a
   performance comparable to that of EUS endoscopists.},

Abstract = {The Artificial Intelligence Applications to Learning Programme has been
   funded since 1987 by what is now known as the Training, Enterprise and
   Education Directorate (TEED). The Programme aimed to explore and
   accelerate the use of AI technologies in learning, in both the
   educational and industrial sectors. The ten demonstrator projects were
   evaluated for their impact on industry and on further and higher
   education, while the project was in progress and later during its
   dissemination phase. The most useful outcomes of evaluation emerged
   during the latter phase, when the innovations had had an opportunity to
   become established and brought to market. There were issues related to
   technology-drive and the need to find problems for which the solution
   existed through group collaboration. One profitable line of development
   was to use AI to enrich training systems. An ideal training system must
   feel ``good{''} to the client, should go beyond existing adaptive
   training systems, offer a high rate of training, be cost effective, have
   visual appeal, give sophisticated feedback, should fit closely with the
   user's current practice, and should have a shelf life of more than 3
   years.},

Title = {The role of artificial intelligence and digital technologies in dam
   engineering: Narrative review and outlook},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {126},
Number = {A},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This narrative review paper explores the diverse applications of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of dam engineering. Authored
   by research engineers specializing in civil engineering and data
   science, and reviewed by experienced dam engineers and AI experts, the
   paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject. The paper
   is structured into three parts. Part 1 offers a concise introduction to
   AI, covering its historical background, major categories, and current
   state of development. In Part 2, the focus shifts to the specific
   applications of AI in hydropower and dam engineering. This section
   delves into the utilization of AI for predictive modeling, real-time
   monitoring, optimization, and planning and design. Notable case studies
   and examples of machine learning techniques applied to predictive models
   and numerical simulations in the context of dams and levees are also
   discussed. Part 3 explores the current and emerging technologies being
   implemented in the industry, including automated decision-making systems
   and the use of AI-powered drones for efficient dam inspection.
   Additionally, the section sheds light on the challenges that must be
   addressed to fully integrate AI into dam engineering practices. This
   paper targets dam engineers, AI experts, and individuals interested in
   the intersection of these fields. Its primary contribution lies in
   providing a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the applications,
   challenges, and potential future developments of AI in dam engineering.
   Over 3300 articles on the intersection of dam engineering and AI were
   identified, and approximately 550 articles (about 17\%) were further
   processed for inclusion in this study. Moreover, it emphasizes the need
   for robust data management, algorithmic transparency, and ethical
   considerations in the implementation of AI systems.},

Title = {The Effect of Law Students in Entrepreneurial Psychology Under the
   Artificial Intelligence Technology},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {With the increasingly serious employment situation in China, the
   government and schools encourage college students to start businesses to
   alleviate employment pressure. College student's successful
   entrepreneurship depends on national preferential policies, social
   support, and, most importantly, their healthy and solid psychological
   quality and entrepreneurial psychological quality. The purpose is to
   understand the entrepreneurial psychology of college students and study
   the entrepreneurial psychological effect. Firstly, the four aspects of
   entrepreneurial psychology are summarized, including entrepreneurial
   awareness, entrepreneurial volition, entrepreneurial ability, and
   entrepreneurial personality. Secondly, the research status of college
   students' entrepreneurial psychology is reviewed, and the existing
   problems are pointed out. Thirdly, the combined model of wavelet
   transform and Neural Network (NN) is proposed, and the feasibility of
   the proposed model is evaluated through the analysis of college
   students' entrepreneurial psychology. The wavelet NN is used in
   experimental design to predict college students' entrepreneurial
   psychology, and the predicted results are compared with the actual
   value. From the perspective of the prediction results of entrepreneurial
   psychology, the combination of wavelet algorithm and neural network is
   more accurate for entrepreneurial psychology prediction and evaluation
   results of law students. Overall, the difference between the predicted
   value and the actual value is within 0.3 points, which is relatively
   stable. According to the analysis of single-factor results, the scores
   of students of different majors in the four dimensions of
   entrepreneurial psychology are all higher than 3.5, but there is no
   significant difference among the four dimensions (P > 0.05), indicating
   that the major has no significant impact on entrepreneurial psychology;
   law students with different educational backgrounds have significant
   differences in entrepreneurial psychology (P < 0.05), among which
   students with a master's degree have the strongest entrepreneurial will,
   while doctoral students have the lowest entrepreneurial will; in terms
   of entrepreneurial psychological capital, men's self-efficacy is higher
   than women's, and the difference is significant (P < 0.05). The
   difference between males and females in the scores of entrepreneurial
   psychological factors' four aspects is not very obvious. In terms of
   entrepreneurial psychological capital, males' self-efficacy is
   significantly higher than females' (P < 0.05). Artificial Intelligence
   (AI) technology has great application prospects in the prediction and
   evaluation of college students' entrepreneurial psychology, and college
   students' entrepreneurial psychology is highly correlated with gender
   and education.},

Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence revolution, deep
   learning is undoubtedly injecting new vitality into machine translation
   technology. In the context of artificial intelligence, teachers must
   find new and effective teaching ideas to improve the actual effect of
   translation teaching, which has drawn the attention of university
   teachers in recent years. With the development of society and the change
   of the times, English is becoming one of the implicit requirements of
   society for talents. Not only in the context of the new changes in
   curriculum, English teaching in schools and teachers is no longer
   limited to examinations, but more importantly, it is also significant to
   cultivate students' comprehensive English ability so that they can
   really use their English knowledge and solve practical problems in life.
   On this basis, this paper investigates the practice of teaching English
   in college in the context of artificial intelligence.},

Volume = {52},
Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {2101-2110},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There has been an exponential rise in artificial intelligence (AI)
   research in imaging in recent years. While the dissemination of study
   data that has the potential to improve clinical practice is welcomed,
   the level of detail included in early AI research reporting has been
   highly variable and inconsistent, particularly when compared to more
   traditional clinical research. However, inclusion checklists are now
   commonly available and accessible to those writing or reviewing clinical
   research papers. AI-specific reporting guidelines also exist and include
   distinct requirements, but these can be daunting for radiologists new to
   the field. Given that pediatric radiology is a specialty faced with
   workforce shortages and an ever-increasing workload, AI could help by
   offering solutions to time-consuming tasks, thereby improving workflow
   efficiency and democratizing access to specialist opinion. As a result,
   pediatric radiologists are expected to be increasingly leading and
   contributing to AI imaging research, and researchers and clinicians
   alike should feel confident that the findings reported are presented in
   a transparent way, with sufficient detail to understand how they apply
   to wider clinical practice. In this review, we describe two of the most
   clinically relevant and available reporting guidelines to help increase
   awareness and engage the pediatric radiologist in conducting AI imaging
   research. This guide should also be useful for those reading and
   reviewing AI imaging research and as a checklist with examples of what
   to expect.},

Title = {Performance of artificial intelligence for detection of subtle and

Journal = {DIGESTIVE ENDOSCOPY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {862-869},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Objectives There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of artificial
   intelligence (AI) software to detect advanced subtle neoplasia,
   particularly flat lesions and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), due to
   low prevalence in testing datasets and prospective trials. This has been
   highlighted as a top research priority for the field. Methods An AI
   algorithm was evaluated on four video test datasets containing 173
   polyps (35,114 polyp-positive frames and 634,988 polyp-negative frames)
   specifically enriched with flat lesions and SSLs, including a
   challenging dataset containing subtle advanced neoplasia. The
   challenging dataset was also evaluated by eight endoscopists (four
   independent, four trainees, according to the Joint Advisory Group on
   gastrointestinal endoscopy {[}JAG] standards in the UK). Results In the
   first two video datasets, the algorithm achieved per-polyp sensitivities
   of 100\% and 98.9\%. Per-frame sensitivities were 84.1\% and 85.2\%. In
   the subtle dataset, the algorithm detected a significantly higher number
   of polyps (P < 0.0001), compared to JAG-independent and trainee
   endoscopists, achieving per-polyp sensitivities of 79.5\%, 37.2\% and
   11.5\%, respectively. Furthermore, when considering subtle polyps
   detected by both the algorithm and at least one endoscopist, the AI
   detected polyps significantly faster on average. Conclusions The AI
   based algorithm achieved high per-polyp sensitivities for advanced
   colorectal neoplasia, including flat lesions and SSLs, outperforming
   both JAG independent and trainees on a very challenging dataset
   containing subtle lesions that could have been overlooked easily and
   contribute to interval colorectal cancer. Further prospective trials
   should evaluate AI to detect subtle advanced neoplasia in higher risk
   populations for colorectal cancer.},

   Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {110558-110572},
Abstract = {Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine
   learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and
   data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine
   learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher
   education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it
   in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
   computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the
   context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as
   schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional
   computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into
   school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine
   learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing
   education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and
   AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research
   body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn
   to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is
   especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the
   emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology
   related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
   situates the existing work in the context of computing education in
   general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators
   should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses
   on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to
   successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing
   curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based
   ``traditional{''} programming is a central aspect and building block in
   developing next generation computational thinking.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
   learning (ML), as well as the arrival of the big data era, technological
   innovations have occurred in the field of cardiovascular medicine.
   First, the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is highly
   dependent on assistive examinations, the interpretation of which is time
   consuming and often limited by the knowledge level and clinical
   experience of doctors; however, AI could be used to automatically
   interpret the images obtained in auxiliary examinations. Second, some of
   the predictions of the incidence and prognosis of CVDs are limited in
   clinical practice by the use of traditional prediction models, but there
   may be occasions when AI-based prediction models perform well by using
   ML algorithms. Third, AI has been used to assist precise classification
   of CVDs by integrating a variety of medical data from patients, which
   helps better characterize the subgroups of heterogeneous diseases. To
   help clinicians better understand the applications of AI in CVDs, this
   review summarizes studies relating to AI-based diagnosis, prediction,
   and classification of CVDs. Finally, we discuss the challenges of
   applying AI to cardiovascular medicine.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, the storage and
   management of library archives and books must meet the needs of readers.
   In this process, people's demands for various knowledge and information
   are increasingly diversified, and realizing the personalized service of
   library archives has become a better solution. At the same time, there
   are certain connections between various books, which is the basis for
   providing personalized services for readers. Through the performance
   test of the library archives information management system, it showed
   that all the performance indicators of the system met the required
   functional requirements. When the number of clients was 50, the memory
   utilization rate was 25.56\%; the number of records was 428, and the
   average response time was 1058ms. Therefore, it is very necessary to use
   artificial intelligence technology and multimedia technology to design
   and build archive information management systems.},

Title = {Students' psychology for teaching design with artificial intelligence
   approaches for enhancing teaching},
Journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 22},
Abstract = {The once impossible concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
   reality and a significant aspect of our daily life. Artificial
   intelligence has changed information seeking, education, communication,
   and behavior. Innovative AI-based technologies have the potential to
   directly or indirectly alter the psychology of students and instructors.
   The bulk of AI-based educational systems aid students in developing
   their communication, evaluation, and learning skills. Many AI-based
   educational techniques have been developed to aid pupils in learning
   more. The advent of computer-assisted language learning (CALL) has made
   learning languages easy and fun. To overcome their worries and build
   confidence, students can practice their language abilities with an
   AI-based system rather than with native speakers. The way that
   individuals educate and learn has evolved as a result of innovative
   AI-based solutions. As artificial intelligence advances, higher
   education has started to apply and implement AI in the classroom to
   enhance the productivity of the educational system. AI technologies in
   education, according to the prior study, introduce novel teaching and
   learning methodologies that are being evaluated in a range of
   situations. According to research, AI-based teaching methods help
   students become better communicators and learners. These AI-based
   teaching aids were welcomed by the students as well. The current study
   has presented an overview of the approaches, tools, and techniques used
   in the literature associated with the students' psychology for teaching
   design with approaches of AI. For this, various famous libraries were
   searched, and the results obtained were disseminated. The current work
   can be relevant for researchers and practitioners working in the domains
   of education, psychology, AI, human computer interaction, user
   experience, and pedagogy. The study will help researchers to explore the
   area of research for further research and to devise new solutions.},

Title = {Improving detection of obstructive coronary artery disease with an
   artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram algorithm},
Journal = {ATHEROSCLEROSIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {381},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background and aims: To evaluate the risk of coronary artery disease
   (CAD), the traditional approach involves assessing the patient's
   symptoms, traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and a 12-lead
   electrocardiogram (ECG). However, currently, there are no established
   criteria for interpreting an ECG to diagnose CAD. Therefore, we sought
   to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG model to assist
   in identifying patients with CAD. Methods: In this study, we included
   patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) at a single center
   between 2017 and 2019. Preprocedural 12-lead ECG performed within 24 h
   was obtained. Obstructive CAD was defined as \& GE; 50\% diameter
   stenosis. Using age, gender and ECG data, we developed stacking models
   using both deep learning and machine learning. Then we compared the
   performance of our models with CVRFs and with cardiologists' ECG
   interpretation. Additionally, we validated our model on an external
   cohort from a different hospital. Results: We included 4951 patients
   with a mean age of 65.5 \& PLUSMN; 12.5 years, of whom 67.0\% were men.
   Based on CAG, obstructive CAD was confirmed in 2637 patients (53.2\%).
   Our best AI model demonstrated comparable performance to CVRFs in
   predicting CAD, with an AUC of 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.75) compared to
   0.71 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.76). The sensitivity and specificity of the AI
   model were 0.75 and 0.54, respectively, while those of CVRFs were 0.67
   and 0.63. Compared to cardiologists, the AI model showed better
   performance with an F1 score of 0.68 vs 0.41. The external validation
   showed generally consistent diagnostic findings, although there was a
   slightly lower level of agreement observed in the external cohort.
   Incorporating ECG and CVRFs improved the AUC to 0.72. Conclusions: Our
   study suggests that an AI-enabled ECG model can assist in identifying
   patients with obstructive CAD, with diagnostic performance similar to
   that of the traditional approach based on CVRFs. This model could serve
   as a useful clinical tool in an outpatient setting to identify patients
   who require further diagnostic tests.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The second edition of the artificial intelligence (AI) data
   challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology with the aim
   to: (i), work on relevant public health issues; (ii), build large,
   multicentre, high quality databases; and (iii), include
   three-dimensional (3D) information and prognostic questions.
   Materials and methods: Relevant clinical questions were proposed by
   French subspecialty colleges of radiology. Their feasibility was
   assessed by experts in the field of AI. A dedicated platform was set up
   for inclusion centers to safely upload their anonymized examinations in
   compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the
   database was checked by experts weekly with annotations performed by
   radiologists. Multidisciplinary teams competed between September 11th
   and October 13th 2019.
   Results: Three questions were selected using different imaging and
   evaluation modalities, including: pulmonary nodule detection and
   classification from 3D computed tomography (CT), prediction of expanded
   disability status scale in multiple sclerosis using 3D magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) and segmentation of muscular surface for
   sarcopenia estimation from two-dimensional CT. A total of 4347
   examinations were gathered of which only 6\% were excluded. Three
   independent databases from 24 individual centers were created. A total
   of 143 participants were split into 20 multidisciplinary teams.
   Conclusion: Three data challenges with over 1200 general data protection
   regulation compliant CT or MRI examinations each were organized. Future
   challenges should be made with more complex situations combining
   histopathological or genetic information to resemble real life
   situations faced by radiologists in routine practice. (C) 2020 Societe

Abstract = {The current level of development of artificial intelligence (AI)
   technologies makes it possible to solve many complex problems just as
   well as a human does. Importance advances in AI are especially
   noticeable in machine learning, the methods and algorithms of which are
   successfully adapted and actively used to solve a wide range of
   problems, including those in the field of nanotechnology. In modern
   fields of nanotechnology, it is important to speed up the process of
   searching for the optimal synthesis parameters when creating new unique
   nanomaterials. The variety of approaches and techniques in both machine
   learning and nanotechnology makes it necessary to systematically review
   current data on the use of AI for solving problems in nanomaterials
   science at both the stage of computer design and of the chemical
   synthesis and diagnostics of the resulting nanomaterials. Particular
   attention is paid to the use of machine-learning technologies for
   studying the thermal and dynamic properties of nanofluids, the processes
   of sorption of nanocomposites, the catalytic activity of nanoparticles,
   and the toxicity of nanoparticles and for solving the problems of
   nanosensorics, as well as for processing the experimental data obtained
   during the diagnostics of various characteristics of nanomaterials.},

Abstract = {Promising new opportunities to apply artificial intelligence (AI) to the
   Earth and environmental sciences are identified, informed by an overview
   of current efforts in the community. Community input was collected at
   the first National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
   workshop on ``Leveraging AI in the Exploitation of Satellite Earth
   Observations and Numerical Weather Prediction{''} held in April 2019.
   This workshop brought together over 400 scientists, program managers,
   and leaders from the public, academic, and private sectors in order to
   enable experts involved in the development and adaptation of AI tools
   and applications to meet and exchange experiences with NOAA experts.
   Paths are described to actualize the potential of AI to better exploit
   the massive volumes of environmental data from satellite and in situ
   sources that are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and
   other Earth and environmental science applications. The main lessons
   communicated from community input via active workshop discussions and
   polling are reported. Finally, recommendations are presented for both
   scientists and decision-makers to address some of the challenges facing
   the adoption of AI across all Earth science.},

Title = {Construction Cost Estimation Model and Dynamic Management Control
   Analysis Based on Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF CIVIL
   ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 11},
Abstract = {Construction cost estimation is affected by a wide range of variables,
   including the area, type, duration, scheduling, and level of recycling
   of materials, in addition to the customary elements such as materials,
   labor, equipment, and method. Construction cost projections greatly
   support managers' decision-making processes, and risk assessment models
   reduce time delay. The cost of construction projects may be modeled and
   forecasted using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
   approaches that require a huge amount of data. Hence, this paper
   proposes an AI-driven construction cost estimation and control analysis
   (AI-CCECA) model for analyzing the preliminary cost of building projects
   and dynamic management of the control system. The first step is to
   identify the most significant cost components and variables that affect
   overall building costs based on real-world data gathered from project
   bids and deep neural networks. As a result of this research,
   construction firms will benefit from improved operational efficiency and
   competitiveness from its ML and optimization framework. Machine learning
   could improve the cost estimation in the program phase of the
   construction process. Workflow optimization for cost savings and
   practical consequences for data-driven management may be achieved using
   machine learning models, as shown by the findings of this study.},

Abstract = {To solve the problems of low completeness of data collection and poor
   accuracy of evaluation of traditional sports training movement
   completion, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based DTW
   pose matching algorithm. Firstly, the sports postures are matched and
   evaluated for movements. Then define the limb angle deviation factor and
   calculate the deviation degree of each limb angle, output the limbs with
   a deviation degrees greater than the set standard, identify the deviated
   limbs that affect the overall movement standard, and realize the
   evaluation and result in the feedback of basic movements in sports
   training. Under the three feature extraction methods, the accuracy of
   the statistical value feature extraction algorithm, LR feature
   extraction algorithm and integrated feature extraction algorithm of the
   DTW poses matching algorithm were 91.12\%, 96.84\% and 96.54\%,
   respectively. The accuracy rates of LDA, KNN, NB, CART and DTW
   algorithms were 25\%, 43\%, 32\%, 33\%, and 72\%, respectively, when the
   other four models were used to compare the accuracy rates with the DTW
   pose matching algorithm. Among them, the accuracy of the DTW algorithm
   is significantly higher than the other four algorithms. Therefore, the
   artificial intelligence-based sports training management model proposed
   in this paper can significantly improve the current problems, such as
   difficulty in assessing the accuracy of sports movement training,
   inefficient supervision of teachers' guidance to students, and
   difficulty for students to improve their movements directly, which has
   strong practical significance and application value.},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {Background: Patients with retinal diseases may exhibit serious
   complications that cause severe visual impairment owing to a lack of
   awareness of retinal diseases and limited medical resources.
   Understanding how artificial intelligence (AI) is used to make
   predictions and perform relevant analyses is a very active area of
   research on retinal diseases. In this study, the relevant Science
   Citation Index (SCI) literature on the AI of retinal diseases published
   from 2012 to 2021 was integrated and analyzed.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to gain insights into the overall
   application of AI technology to the research of retinal diseases from
   set time and space dimensions.
   Methods: Citation data downloaded from the Web of Science Core
   Collection database for AI in retinal disease publications from January
   1, 2012, to December 31, 2021, were considered for this analysis.
   Information retrieval was analyzed using the online analysis platforms
   of literature metrology: Bibliometrc, CiteSpace V, and VOSviewer.
   Results: A total of 197 institutions from 86 countries contributed to
   relevant publications; China had the largest number and researchers from
   University College London had the highest H-index. The reference
   clusters of SCI papers were clustered into 12 categories. ``Deep
   learning{''} was the cluster with the widest range of cocited
   references. The burst keywords represented the research frontiers in
   2018-2021, which were ``eye disease{''} and ``enhancement.{''}
   Conclusions: This study provides a systematic analysis method on the
   literature regarding AI in retinal diseases. Bibliometric analysis
   enabled obtaining results that were objective and comprehensive. In the
   future, high-quality retinal image-forming AI technology with strong
   stability and clinical applicability will continue to be encouraged.},

Title = {Correlation Analysis between Higher Education Level and College
   Students' Public Mental Health Driven by AI},

Abstract = {Generally, there is a certain correlation between the level of higher
   education and the public mental health of college students.
   Traditionally, questionnaires and literature research methods are used
   to analyze the correlation between mental health and higher education,
   but these methods are always limited by many factors, such as resource
   conditions, survey paths, theoretical framework, and technical means. In
   recent years, with the rapid development and application of artificial
   intelligence technology, a new direction of analyzing the correlation
   between higher education level and college students' public mental
   health has been given. The artificial intelligence method makes the
   correlation analysis change from subjective to big data algorithm
   evaluation, which can make up for the shortcomings and inefficiency of
   traditional methods, truly analyze the degree of correlation, and put
   forward exact solutions, which is of great significance for further
   evaluating and monitoring the public mental health of college students
   in higher education. This study first analyzes different AI algorithms
   and determines to use convolution neural network and random forest
   algorithm to establish an AI correlation model. After testing and data
   analysis, the established model has an accuracy of 87.5\% in the
   determination and analysis of correlation. Compared with support vector
   machine (SVM) and backpropagation (BP) neural network algorithm, it has
   a higher recognition accuracy.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence: Guidance for clinical imaging and therapeutic
   radiography professionals, a summary by the Society of Radiographers AI
   working group},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1192-1202},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to be
   increasingly adopted in medical imaging and radiotherapy clinical
   practice, however research, education and partnerships have not really
   caught up yet to facilitate a safe and effective transition. The aim of
   the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working
   in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and
   stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the
   multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including
   all staff, volunteers, students and learners.
   Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR
   working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a
   rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review.
   Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as
   well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from
   external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback
   received and a final consensus was reached.
   Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with
   to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and
   radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately
   adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary
   knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic
   radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be
   central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led
   research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable
   radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions.
   Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is
   integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients
   and service users.
   Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with
   AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for
   different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our
   educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong
   clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice.
   Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education,
   research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are
   discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these
   domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK
   radiographers.
   Implications for practice: This review offers the most up-to-date
   recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and
   service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services.
   Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to
   AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are
   maximised and challenges and risks are minimised. This guidance will
   need to be updated regularly given the fast-changing pace of AI
   development and innovation. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by

Title = {Factors affecting students' preparedness for the fourth industrial
   revolution in higher education institutions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 DEC 1},
Abstract = {Purpose - Knowing the students' readiness for the fourth industrial
   revolution (4IR) is essential to producing competent, knowledgeable and
   skilled graduates who can contribute to the skilled workforce in the
   country. This will assist the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to
   ensure that their graduates own skill sets needed to work in the 4IR
   era. However, studies on students' readiness and preparedness for the
   4IR in developing countries such as the Sultanate of Oman are still
   lacking. Therefore, this study investigates students' readiness level
   and preparedness for the 4IR. The findings of this study will benefit
   the HEIs policymakers, administration, faculties, departments,
   industries and society at large since they will be informed of the
   student's readiness and preparedness toward industry 4.0.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted the measures from the
   same context as previous studies in this study. The questionnaire was
   divided into three sections; the first part described the purpose and
   introduction of the search with the surety to keep the data
   confidential. The second part consisted of demographical information
   like gender, education. The last parts consisted of four subsections,
   question items in these parts are based on the related previous study.
   Characteristics consisted of 14 items, knowledge consisted of 18 items
   related to 4IR technologies, Organizational Dimension comprised of four
   items related to academic programs, curriculum and training.
   Preparedness contained two items. The participants have rated all the
   items in 5-Likert scale.
   Findings - Results from structural equation modeling showed that
   students' characteristics, knowledge of 4IR technologies and
   organizational dimensions significantly impact their preparedness for
   the 4IR. The study also found that organizational dimensions have the
   highest impact on students' preparedness. Furthermore, the
   organizational dimension significantly influences students' knowledge of
   4IR technology. Moreover, students' characteristics related to 4IR are
   significantly affected by their knowledge of 4IR technology and
   organizational dimension. The findings suggest that HEIs are responsible
   for increasing the adoption of 4IR, and therefore organizational
   dimensions such as the academic programs, training, technological
   infrastructure and others are all critical for preparing students for a
   better future and should be given a priority.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has used academic
   programs and training to measure the organizational dimension. However,
   other important factors should be considered, such as technological
   infrastructure and leadership and governance of HEIs. Second, the
   current research depends on quantitative data, so future research should
   implement a mixed methodology (questionnaires, depth interviews,
   document analysis and focus group) to understand the factors affecting
   students' readiness for 4IR clearly. Finally, although the 4IR has
   numerous benefits, it also has challenges in its implementation, so
   future studies should focus on challenges encountered by different
   stakeholders in implementing 4IRrelated technologies.
   Practical implications - The curriculum must include mandatory courses
   related to IT infrastructure design, user experience programming,
   electronic measurement and control principles, and programming for data
   science. HEIs should also foster interdisciplinary knowledge by
   integrating IT, Engineering, Business and Sciences. Furthermore, the
   HEIs should develop their infrastructure to have smart campuses, labs,
   classrooms and libraries to make HEIs a space where knowledge can be
   generated and innovative solutions can be proposed. This entails HEIs
   offering necessary hardware, software and technical support because if
   the HEIs improve their technological resources, students will be capable
   of using 4IR-related technologies effectively.
   Originality/value - The advancement of technology has resulted in the
   emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial
   intelligence, blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, data science,
   virtual reality and 3D printing. It is essential to investigate
   students' readiness for 4IR. However, there is no study as per
   researchers' knowledge talked about students readiness in HEIs in the
   Arab world. This study could be a basis for more research on students'
   perception of the 4IR covering students from various backgrounds and
   levels.},

Abstract = {Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is commonly used to identify the fault type
   in power transformers. However, the available DGA methods have certain
   limitations because every method depends on the concentration of the
   dissolved gases. Therefore, in this work, hybrid feature
   selection-artificial intelligence-gravitational search algorithm (GSA)
   techniques were proposed to determine the fault type of power
   transformers based on DGA data. The artificial intelligence (AI) methods
   applied include support vector machine and artificial neural network.
   Both AI methods were optimised by GSA to enhance the accuracy of the
   results. Feature selections using stepwise regression and robust
   regression were applied to utilise only significant gases. The accuracy
   of the results was tested with various ratios of testing and training
   data. Comparison of the results using the proposed method with other
   optimisation methods and the previous works was performed to validate
   the performance of the proposed technique. It was observed that the
   proposed hybrid feature selection-AI-GSA technique yields reasonable
   accuracy although fewer types of dissolved gases were used. Therefore,
   the proposed method can be recommended for the application of automated
   power transformer fault type detection based on DGA data in practice.},

Title = {Construction and Application of iWrite Artificial Intelligence
   Evaluation System for College English Writing},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {The traditional English writing evaluation is an artificial way to
   judge, which is a relatively subjective evaluation method. Also, the
   artificial method has the defects of low timeliness and high error rate,
   which limits the interest of college students in English learning. If
   the content of college students' English writing cannot be judged, it
   also limits their understanding of the correctness of the English
   language, because English writing can reflect problems such as English
   grammar, sentence structure, and emotional expression. Artificial
   intelligence (AI) technology has developed rapidly, and it can
   efficiently process the data of research objects. If artificial
   intelligence technology is combined with English writing evaluation, it
   can improve the timeliness and error rate of college students' English
   evaluation. This is also an innovative way of judging college students'
   English writing. Combining the characteristics of great learning English
   writing and judging criteria, this research uses artificial intelligence
   technology to design an efficient judging platform. It needs to use a
   convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM)
   neural network to extract features of grammar, sentence patterns, and
   emotional expressions of college students' English writing. The research
   results show that CNN and LSTM methods have high feasibility and
   accuracy in extracting grammar, sentence patterns, and emotional
   expressions of college students' English writing. The prediction error
   of the college students' English writing evaluation system is also
   within a reasonable range. CNN and LSTM methods have high accuracy in
   predicting English rectangle, grammar, and emotional expression, and the
   largest prediction error is only 2.91\%. Also, the three prediction
   errors are distributed within 3\%.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence and Authorship Editor Policy: ChatGPT, Bard Bing
   AI, and beyond},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and large-language model chatbots have generated
   significant attention in higher education, and in research practice.
   Whether ChatGPT, Bard, Jasper Chat, Socratic, Bing AI, DialoGPT, or
   something else, these are all shaping how education and research occur.
   In this Editorial, we offer five editorial principles to guide
   decision-making for editors, which will also become policy for the
   Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice. First, we
   articulate that non-human authorship does not constitute authorship.
   Second, artificial intelligence should be leveraged to support authors.
   Third, artificial intelligence can offer useful feedback and pre-review.
   Fourth, transparency of artificial intelligence usage is an expectation.
   And fifth, the use of AI in research design, conduct, and dissemination
   must comply with established ethical principles. In these five
   principles, we articulate a position of optimism for the new forms of
   knowledge and research we might garner. We see AI as a mechanism that
   may augment our current practices but will not likely replace all of
   them. However, we do issue caution to the limitations of large language
   models including possible proliferation of poor-quality research,
   Stochastic Parroting, and data hallucinations. As with all research,
   authors should be comfortably familiar with the underlying methods being

Title = {Investigating the Ethical and Data Governance Issues of Artificial
   Intelligence in Surgery: Protocol for a Delphi Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: The rapid uptake of digital technology into the operating
   room has the potential to improve patient outcomes, increase efficiency
   of the use of operating rooms, and allow surgeons to progress quickly up
   learning curves. These technologies are, however, dependent on huge
   amounts of data, and the consequences of their mismanagement are
   significant. While the field of artificial intelligence ethics is able
   to provide a broad framework for those designing and implementing these
   technologies into the operating room, there is a need to determine and
   address the ethical and data governance challenges of using digital
   technology in this unique environment.
   Objective: The objectives of this study are to define the term digital
   surgery and gain expert consensus on the key ethical and data governance
   issues, barriers, and future research goals of the use of artificial
   intelligence in surgery.
   Methods: Experts from the fields of surgery, ethics and law, policy,
   artificial intelligence, and industry will be invited to participate in
   a 4-round consensus Delphi exercise. In the first round, participants
   will supply free-text responses across 4 key domains. ethics, data
   governance, barriers, and future research goals. They will also be asked
   to provide their understanding of the term digital surgery. In
   subsequent rounds, statements will be grouped, and participants will be
   asked to rate the importance of each issue on a 9-point Likert scale
   ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (critically important).
   Consensus is defined a priori as a score of 7 to 9 by 70\% of
   respondents and 1 to 3 by less than 30\% of respondents. A final online
   meeting round will be held to discuss inclusion of statements and draft
   a consensus document.
   Results: Full ethical approval has been obtained for the study by the
   local research ethics committee at Imperial College, London (20IC6136).
   We anticipate round 1 to commence in January 2021.
   Conclusions: The results of this study will define the term digital
   surgery, identify the key issues and barriers, and shape future research
   in this area.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine if fully automated measurements
   of global longitudinal strain (GLS) using a novel motion estimation
   technology based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are
   feasible and comparable with a conventional speckle-tracking
   application. BACKGROUND GLS is an important parameter when evaluating
   left ventricular function. However, analyses of GLS are time consuming
   and demand expertise, and thus are underused in clinical practice.
   METHODS In this study, 200 patients with a wide range of left ventricle
   (LV) function were included. Three standard apical cine-loops were
   analyzed using the AI pipeline. The AI method measured GLS and was
   compared with a commercially available semiautomatic speckle-tracking
   software (EchoPAC v202, GE Healthcare. RESULTS The AI method succeeded
   to both correctly classify all 3 standard apical views and perform
   timing of cardiac events in 89\% of patients. Furthermore, the method
   successfully performed automatic segmentation, motion estimates, and
   measurements of GLS in all examinations, across different cardiac
   pathologies and throughout the spectrum of LV function. GLS was-12.0 +/-
   4.1\% for the AI method and-13.5 +/- 5.3\% for the reference method.
   Bias was-1.4 +/- 0.3\% (95\% limits of agreement: 2.3 to-5.1), which is
   comparable with intervendor studies. The AI method eliminated
   measurement variability and a complete GLS analysis was processed within
   15 s. CONCLUSIONS Through the range of LV function this novel AI method
   succeeds, without any operator input, to automatically identify the 3
   standard apical views, perform timing of cardiac events, trace the
   myocardium, perform motion estimation, and measure GLS. Fully automated
   measurements based on AI could facilitate the clinical implementation of
   GLS. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2021;14:1918-1928) (c) 2021 The Authors.

Abstract = {The key of deep learning is how to extract abstract, deep and nonlinear
   target features, in which algorithm plays a crucial role. In this paper,
   the authors analyze the intelligent system design of entrepreneurship
   education classroom based on artificial intelligence and image feature
   retrieval. Pyramid pooling is used to transform any size feature map
   into fixed size feature vector, which is finally sent to the full
   connection layer for classification and regression. Experimental results
   show that the algorithm accelerates the convergence of the whole network
   and improves the detection speed. The education taught by
   entrepreneurial class is not only to help college students to seek a
   stable career, but also to help college students develop their own
   potential, cultivate entrepreneurial awareness, improve entrepreneurial
   quality and ability. Entrepreneurship education should not only stay in
   the design of subject courses, but should integrate entrepreneurship
   education with internet entrepreneurship practice. On this basis, we
   provide new countermeasures and suggestions for improving the quality
   and ability of college students in the process of entrepreneurial

Abstract = {Background: Medical students' career choices and motivations might be
   significantly impacted by the rapid advances in artificial intelligence
   (AI) and the recent hype around it.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of AI on medical
   students' preferences for radiology as a future specialty choice.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and
   December 2021 among all medical students in the three regional medical
   colleges in Al-Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia.
   Results: The survey resulted in 319 complete responses. Among the
   respondents, 26.96\% considered radiology to be one of their top three
   future specialty choices. Only a minority of the respondents (23.2\%)
   believed that radiologists would be replaced by AI during their
   lifetime. The misperceptions of the potential impact of AI led 22.26\%
   of the students to be less likely to consider a career in radiology.
   Students with an interest in radiology were less influenced by such
   misperceptions (p=.01). Based on self-reported confidence measures, the
   basic understanding of AI was higher among students with an interest in
   radiology and students with prior exposure to AI (p<.05).
   Conclusion: The students' preferences for radiology as a future
   specialty choice were influenced by their misperceptions of the
   potential impact of AI on the discipline. Students' interest in
   radiology and prior exposure to AI helped them grasp AI and eliminate
   the hype around it.},

Title = {Neurophysiological Measurements in Higher Education: A Systematic
   Literature Review},

Abstract = {The use of neurophysiological measurements to advance the design,
   development, use, acceptance, influence and adaptivity of information
   systems is receiving increasing attention. Within the field of
   education, neurophysiological measurements have commonly been used to
   capture a learner's psychological constructs such as cognitive load,
   attention and emotion, which play an important role in student learning.
   This paper systematically examines the literature on the use of
   neurophysiological measurements in higher education. In particular,
   using a well-established Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, we
   identified 83 papers reporting empirical evidence about the outcome of
   employing neurophysiological measurements within educational
   technologies in higher education. The findings of the SLR are divided
   into three main themes discussing the employed measurements,
   experimental settings and constructs and outcomes. Our findings identify
   that (1) electroencephalography and facial expression recognition are
   the dominantly employed types of measurement, (2) the majority of the
   experiments used a pre-experimental design, (3) attention and emotion
   are the two foremost cognitive and non-cognitive constructs under
   investigation, while less emphasis is paid to meta-cognitive constructs
   and (4) the reported results mostly focus on monitoring learners'
   states, which are not always the same as the intended purpose, such as
   developing an adaptive system. On a broader term, the review of the
   literature provides evidence of the effective use of neurophysiological
   measurements by educational technologies to enhance learning; however, a
   number of challenges and concerns related to the accuracy and validity
   of the captured construct, the intrusiveness of the employed instruments
   as well as ethical and privacy considerations have surfaced, that need
   to be addressed before such technologies can be employed and adopted at
   scale.},

Abstract = {Although species identification apps are becoming increasingly popular
   in citizen science, they are hardly used in university courses on
   biodiversity literacy. In this study, we investigated whether the use of
   a plant identification app by students provides similar data quality to
   the use of scientific keys and whether it improves the process of
   knowledge acquisition. To this end, dry grassland plots were monitored
   in Berlin to record plant species diversity by two groups, Bachelor's
   and Master's students, with different experience in plant
   identification. Both groups were asked to survey the plots once in April
   and once in June, the first time with the app Pl@ntNet, and the second
   time with scientific keys commonly used in teaching. To evaluate their
   performance and the respective tools, the results were compared with
   those of experts from the same plots. The students identified, on
   average, only half of the plants per plot and misidentified or failed to
   identify a high proportion of species compared with the experts,
   regardless of the identification tool. In addition, the number of plants
   identified that did not occur at all in the region or in the considered
   habitat was alarmingly high. In view of the worldwide loss of species
   knowledge, it is becoming clear that apps can trigger the study of a
   species group, but do not solve the fundamental problem of neglecting
   biodiversity courses at universities.},

Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
   across all disciplines has exploded in the past few years, with the
   ever-growing size of data and the changing needs of higher education,

   follows a repeatable and objective process of exploring the literature.
   Second, the study outlines and explains the literature's themes related
   to the use of AI-based algorithms in digital education. The study
   findings present six themes related to the use of machines in digital
   education. The synthesized evidence in this study suggests that machine
   learning and deep learning algorithms are used in several themes of
   digital learning. These themes include using intelligent tutors, dropout
   predictions, performance predictions, adaptive and predictive learning
   and learning styles, analytics and group-based learning, and automation.
   artificial neural network and support vector machine algorithms appear
   to be utilized among all the identified themes, followed by random
   forest, decision tree, naive Bayes, and logistic regression algorithms.},

Abstract = {Technological advancements have paved the path for utilizing artificial
   intelligence and wireless networks in every field. In this study, people
   will research the ideological and political education (IPE) strategies
   based on wireless networks and artificial intelligence knowledge maps on
   college students' entrepreneurship. IPE deals with a country's political
   status, forming a social and economic study. This education utilizes
   wireless network technology and artificial intelligence for teaching and
   learning. The proposed system studies IPE strategies that use artificial
   intelligence and wireless networks in a combined way of intelligent
   wireless network (IWN) in a knowledge map on college students'
   entrepreneurship. The idea is then adapted to the college student's
   entrepreneurship and found efficient. Recursive algorithms (RA) call
   themselves out by lowering input quantities and returning values for the
   input signal by performing basic processes in a repeated iteration.
   Artificial intelligence utilizes recursion to develop entrepreneurship
   skills among college students. The proposed algorithm is compared with
   the traditional remote supervision algorithm (RSA), and the study
   results that RA has obtained an accuracy of 98\%.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence today has become a valuable tool for
   decision-making, where universities have to adapt and optimize their
   processes, improving the quality of their services. In this context, the
   economic income from collections is vital for sustainability. There are
   several problems that can contribute to student delinquency, such as
   economic, financial, academic, family, and personal. For this reason,
   the study aimed to develop a classification model to predict the payment
   behavior of enrolled students. The methodology is a proactive,
   technological study of incremental innovation with a synchronous
   temporal scope. The study population consisted of 8,495 undergraduate
   students enrolled in the 2022 -II academic semester, containing
   information on academic performance, financial situation, and personal
   factors. The result is a classification model using the H2O.ai platform,
   discretization algorithms, data balancing, and the R language. Data
   science algorithms obtained the base from the institution's computer
   system. The data sets for training and testing correspond to 70\% and
   30\%, obtaining the GBM Grid model whose performance metrics are AUC of
   0.905, AUCPR of 0.926, and logLoss equivalent to 0.311; that is, the
   model efficiently complies with the classification of student debtors to
   provide them with early intervention service and help them complete
   their studies.},

Abstract = {The ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation district
   has been of great interest because of their rich vegetation types and
   higher biomass density than any other land cover types, it is urgent to
   evaluate the ecological value of tropical forests in water conservation
   district. However, the monitoring of tropical forests in water
   conservation district is faced with many problems, such as high forest
   density, complexity and diversity of the forest structure, complex
   topography and climate conditions, and the difficulty of access for
   investigators. In order to solve the above difficulties, this study
   combined 3D point cloud reconstruction based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
   - Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM) technology with forest type
   classification based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method,
   combined with a small amount of forest permanent sample plot survey
   data, to accurately evaluate the forest biomass distribution and forest
   biodiversity in water conservation district. The results show that the
   overall classification accuracy of the 20 forest types in water
   conservation district based on the CNN method is 0.61, the overall Kappa
   coefficient is 0.59, and the conditional Kappa coefficient is
   concentrated in the range of 0.43-0.85. The Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE) of the plane measurement of UAV-SfM technology is 0.432 m, and
   the RMSE of the elevation measurement is 0.989 m, the effect of this UAV
   technology in tropical forest monitoring is superior. Using the
   techniques mentioned above, this study can effectively and accurately
   monitor and evaluate the biomass distribution and biodiversity of
   tropical forests in the water conservation district. Based on the
   precision forest ecological monitoring data, this study can develop a
   scientific and reasonable sustainable forest management plan for the
   water conservation district according to the distribution of forest
   biomass and biodiversity. The combination of UAV-SfM technology and the
   CNN method is an innovative attempt, and the integration of UAV and
   artificial intelligence technology solves practical problems faced by
   sustainable forest management. UAV and artificial intelligence will also
   provide an important foundation for forest ecological environment
   sustainability assessment research.},

Abstract = {Using simulations or experiments performed at some set of temperatures
   to learn about the physics or chemistry at some other arbitrary
   temperature is a problem of immense practical and theoretical relevance.
   Here we develop a framework based on statistical mechanics and
   generative artificial intelligence that allows solving this problem.
   Specifically, we work with denoising diffusion probabilistic models and
   show how these models in combination with replica exchange molecular
   dynamics achieve superior sampling of the biomolecular energy landscape
   at temperatures that were never simulated without assuming any
   particular slow degrees of freedom. The key idea is to treat the
   temperature as a fluctuating random variable and not a control parameter
   as is usually done. This allows us to directly sample from the joint
   probability distribution in configuration and temperature space. The
   results here are demonstrated for a chirally symmetric peptide and
   single-strand RNA undergoing conformational transitions in all-atom
   water. We demonstrate how we can discover transition states and
   metastable states that were previously unseen at the temperature of
   interest and even bypass the need to perform further simulations for a
   wide range of temperatures. At the same time, any unphysical states are
   easily identifiable through very low Boltzmann weights. The procedure
   while shown here for a class of molecular simulations should be more
   generally applicable to mixing information across simulations and
   experiments with varying control parameters.},

   Insights for Researchers and Medical Professionals},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},

Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic almost two years ago, there
   have been more than 700,000 scientific papers published on the subject.
   An individual researcher cannot possibly get acquainted with such a huge
   text corpus and, therefore, some help from artificial intelligence (AI)
   is highly needed. We propose the AI-based tool to help researchers
   navigate the medical papers collections in a meaningful way and extract
   some knowledge from scientific COVID-19 papers. The main idea of our
   approach is to get as much semi-structured information from text corpus
   as possible, using named entity recognition (NER) with a model called
   PubMedBERT and Text Analytics for Health service, then store the data
   into NoSQL database for further fast processing and insights generation.
   Additionally, the contexts in which the entities were used (neutral or
   negative) are determined. Application of NLP and text-based emotion
   detection (TBED) methods to COVID-19 text corpus allows us to gain
   insights on important issues of diagnosis and treatment (such as changes
   in medical treatment over time, joint treatment strategies using several
   medications, and the connection between signs and symptoms of
   coronavirus, etc.).},

   deemed media literacy education a required competence in order for
   audiences to maintain a discerning attitude and to verify messages
   rather than automatically believing them. This study developed a highly
   efficient message discrimination method using new technology using
   artificial intelligence and big data information processing containing
   general news and content farm message data on approximately 938,000
   articles. Deep neural network technology was used to create a news

   the experimental course design. Two groups of participants used
   different methods to perform message discrimination. The results
   revealed that the system significantly expanded the participants'
   knowledge of media literacy. The system positively affected the
   participants' attitude, confidence, and motivation towards media

Abstract = {BACKGROUND. Deep learning-based convolutional neural networks have
   enabled major advances in development of artificial intelligence (AI)
   software applications. Modern AI applications offer comprehensive
   multiorgan evaluation.
   OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the impact of an
   automated AI platform integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
   interpretation on radiologists' interpretation times when evaluated in a
   real-world clinical setting.
   METHODS. In this prospective single-center study, a commercial AI
   software solution was integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
   interpretation. The software provided automated analysis of cardiac,
   pulmonary, and musculoskeletal findings, including labeling, segmenting,
   and measuring normal structures as well as detecting, labeling, and
   measuring abnormalities. AI-annotated images and autogenerated summary
   results were stored in the PACS and available to interpreting
   radiologists. A total of 390 patients (204 women, 186 men; mean age,
   62.8 +/- 13.3 {[}SD] years) who underwent outpatient chest CT between
   January 19, 2021, and January 28, 2021, were included. Scans were
   randomized using 1:1 allocation between AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted
   arms and were clinically interpreted by one of three cardiothoracic
   radiologists (65 scans per arm per radiologist; total of 195 scans per
   arm) who recorded interpretation times using a stopwatch. Findings were
   categorized according to review of report impressions. Interpretation
   times were compared between arms.
   RESULTS. Mean interpretation times were significantly shorter in the
   AI-assisted than in the non-AI-assisted arm for all three readers (289
   +/- 89 vs 344 +/- 129 seconds, p < .001; 449 +/- 110 vs 649 +/- 82
   seconds, p < .001; 281 +/- 114 vs 348 +/- 93 seconds, p = .01) and for
   readers combined (328 +/- 122 vs 421 +/- 175 seconds, p < .001). For
   readers combined, the mean difference was 93 seconds (95\% CI, 63-123
   seconds), corresponding with a 22.1\% reduction in the AI-assisted arm.
   Mean interpretation time was also shorter in the AI-assisted arm
   compared with the non-AI-assisted arm for contrast- enhanced scans (83
   seconds), noncontrast scans (104 seconds), negative scans (84 seconds),
   positive scans without significant new findings (117 seconds), and
   positive scans with significant new findings (92 seconds).
   CONCLUSION. Cardiothoracic radiologists exhibited a 22.1\% reduction in
   chest CT interpretations times when they had access to results from an
   automated AI support platform during real-world clinical practice.
   CLINICAL IMPACT. Integration of the AI support platform into clinical
   workflow improved radiologist efficiency.},

Abstract = {Without the constraints of time and place, e-learning can offer a strong
   learning environment. The notion of e-learning has taken on a new sense
   with the advent and popularization of mobile devices and ubiquitous
   computing, enabling students to have access to several diverse
   opportunities for communicating with e-learning programs. Around the
   same time, it has prompted the course's planners to select the most
   suitable technology from among the various innovations required for the
   storing and dissemination of information representation. As a Learning
   Management System (LMS), the Blackboard system now has a recog-nized
   role in the knowledge management of the education system. Blackboard
   offers effective and easy-to-use instructional teaching, correspondence,
   and assessment systems. Blackboard Ally works to create more open
   content for inter-active classes and helps institutions create a more
   balanced experience of teaching and learning. Blackboard Ally is a
   unique application that easily blends with the Virtual Learning
   Environment (VLE) and runs directly within the workflows currently used
   by administrators, instructors, and students. This analysis is intended
   to explore the successful utilization and assessment of Blackboard Ally
   among academics in the Jazan University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The
   key purpose of this study is to examine how administrators, faculty
   members, and students use Ally for Blackboard LMS's functionality across
   online classes to analyze both the learning process and the success of
   the individual. A critical review of the literature, utilization, and
   examination of Blackboard Ally shows a good range of scholarly opinions,
   research, hypotheses, models, and experiences about the simulated
   learning environment. According to our knowledge and litera-ture review,
   this is the first research article to evaluate the implementation and
   utilization of the Ally tool by Blackboard LMS.},

Abstract = {Corneal diseases, uncorrected refractive errors, and cataract represent
   the major causes of blindness globally. The number of refractive
   surgeries, either cornea- or lens-based, is also on the rise as the
   demand for perfect vision continues to increase. With the recent
   advancement and potential promises of artificial intelligence (AI)
   technologies demonstrated in the realm of ophthalmology, particularly
   retinal diseases and glaucoma, AI researchers and clinicians are now
   channeling their focus toward the less explored ophthalmic areas related
   to the anterior segment of the eye. Conditions that rely on anterior
   segment imaging modalities, including slit-lamp photography, anterior
   segment optical coherence tomography, corneal tomography, in vivo
   confocal microscopy and/or optical biometers, are the most commonly
   explored areas. These include infectious keratitis, keratoconus, corneal
   grafts, ocular surface pathologies, preoperative screening before
   refractive surgery, intraocular lens calculation, and automated
   refraction, among others. In this review, we aimed to provide a
   comprehensive update on the utilization of AI in anterior segment
   diseases, with particular emphasis on the recent advancement in the past
   few years. In addition, we demystify some of the basic principles and
   terminologies related to AI, particularly machine learning and deep
   learning, to help improve the understanding, research and clinical
   implementation of these AI technologies among the ophthalmologists and
   vision scientists. As we march toward the era of digital health,
   guidelines such as CONSORT-AI, SPIRIT-AI, and STARD-AI will play crucial
   roles in guiding and standardizing the conduct and reporting of
   AI-related trials, ultimately promoting their potential for clinical
   translation.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence Supporting the Training of Communication Skills
   in the Education of Health Care Professions: Scoping Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {Background: Communication is a crucial element of every health care
   profession, rendering communication skills training in all health care
   professions as being of great importance. Technological advances such as
   artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly machine learning (ML) may
   support this cause: it may provide students with an opportunity for
   easily accessible and readily available communication training.
   Objective: This scoping review aimed to summarize the status quo
   regarding the use of AI or ML in the acquisition of communication skills
   in academic health care professions.
   Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search across the
   PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and
   CINAHL databases to identify articles that covered the use of AI or ML
   in communication skills training of undergraduate students pursuing
   health care profession education. Using an inductive approach, the
   included studies were organized into distinct categories. The specific
   characteristics of the studies, methods and techniques used by AI or ML
   applications, and main outcomes of the studies were evaluated.
   Furthermore, supporting and hindering factors in the use of AI and ML
   for communication skills training of health care professionals were
   outlined.
   Results: The titles and abstracts of 385 studies were identified, of
   which 29 (7.5\%) underwent full-text review. Of the 29 studies, based on
   the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 (3.1\%) were included. The
   studies were organized into 3 distinct categories: studies using AI and
   ML for text analysis and information extraction, studies using AI and ML
   and virtual reality, and studies using AI and ML and the simulation of
   virtual patients, each within the academic training of the communication
   skills of health care professionals. Within these thematic domains, AI
   was also used for the provision of feedback. The motivation of the
   involved agents played a major role in the implementation process.
   Reported barriers to the use of AI and ML in communication skills
   training revolved around the lack of authenticity and limited natural
   flow of language exhibited by the AI-and ML-based virtual patient
   systems. Furthermore, the use of educational AI-and ML-based systems in
   communication skills training for health care professionals is currently
   limited to only a few cases, topics, and clinical domains.
   Conclusions: The use of AI and ML in communication skills training for
   health care professionals is clearly a growing and promising field with
   a potential to render training more cost-effective and less
   time-consuming. Furthermore, it may serve learners as an individualized
   and readily available exercise method. However, in most cases, the
   outlined applications and technical solutions are limited in terms of
   access, possible scenarios, the natural flow of a conversation, and
   authenticity. These issues still stand in the way of any widespread
   implementation ambitions.},

Title = {Adaptive cognitive fit: Artificial intelligence augmented management of
   information facets and representations},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Explosive growth in big data technologies and artificial intelligence
   (AI) applications have led to increasing pervasiveness of information
   facets and a rapidly growing array of information representations.
   Information facets, such as equivocality and veracity, can dominate and
   significantly influence human perceptions of information and
   consequently affect human performance. Extant research in cognitive fit,
   which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on the effects of
   aligning information representation and task on performance, without
   sufficient consideration to information facets and attendant cognitive
   challenges. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the
   interplay of these dominant information facets with information
   representations and tasks, and their influence on human performance. We
   suggest that artificially intelligent technologies that can adapt
   information representations to overcome cognitive limitations are
   necessary for these complex information environments. To this end, we
   propose and test a novel ``Adaptive Cognitive Fit{''} (ACF) framework
   that explains the influence of information facets and AI-augmented
   information representations on human performance. We draw on information
   processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory to advance the ACF
   framework and a set of propositions. We empirically validate the ACF
   propositions with an economic experiment that demonstrates the influence
   of information facets, and a machine learning simulation that
   establishes the viability of using AI to improve human performance.},

Title = {Survival Prediction in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma: A Proof of
   Concept Study Using Artificial Intelligence for Risk Assessment},

Abstract = {Several scoring systems have been devised to objectively predict
   survival for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma
   (ICC) and support treatment stratification, but they have failed
   external validation. The aim of the present study was to improve
   prognostication using an artificial intelligence-based approach. We
   retrospectively identified 417 patients with ICC who were referred to
   our tertiary care center between 1997 and 2018. Of these, 293 met the
   inclusion criteria. Established risk factors served as input nodes for
   an artificial neural network (ANN). We compared the performance of the
   trained model to the most widely used conventional scoring system, the
   Fudan score. Predicting 1-year survival, the ANN reached an area under
   the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 for the training set and 0.80 for the
   validation set. The AUC of the Fudan score was significantly lower in
   the validation set (0.77, p < 0.001). In the training set, the Fudan
   score yielded a lower AUC (0.74) without reaching significance (p =
   0.24). Thus, ANNs incorporating a multitude of known risk factors can
   outperform conventional risk scores, which typically consist of a
   limited number of parameters. In the future, such artificial
   intelligence-based approaches have the potential to improve treatment
   stratification when models trained on large multicenter data are openly
   available.},

Title = {ChatGPT versus engineering education assessment: a multidisciplinary and

Abstract = {ChatGPT, a sophisticated online chatbot, sent shockwaves through many
   sectors once reports filtered through that it could pass exams. In
   higher education, it has raised many questions about the authenticity of
   assessment and challenges in detecting plagiarism. Amongst the resulting
   frenetic hubbub, hints of potential opportunities in how ChatGPT could
   support learning and the development of critical thinking have also
   emerged. In this paper, we examine how ChatGPT may affect assessment in
   engineering education by exploring ChatGPT responses to existing
   assessment prompts from ten subjects across seven Australian
   universities. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of current
   assessment practice and discuss opportunities on how ChatGPT can be used
   to facilitate learning. As artificial intelligence is rapidly improving,
   this analysis sets a benchmark for ChatGPT's performance as of early
   2023 in responding to engineering education assessment prompts. ChatGPT
   did pass some subjects and excelled with some assessment types. Findings
   suggest that changes in current practice are needed, as typically with
   little modification to the input prompts, ChatGPT could generate
   passable responses to many of the assessments, and it is only going to
   get better as future versions are trained on larger data sets.},

Abstract = {Global environmental pollution has an extremely negative impact on the
   population of the planet and threatens the future of mankind. One of the
   main sources of waste and toxic emissions into the atmosphere is the
   construction sector. It is necessary to find ways to minimize the damage
   caused to nature. Currently, artificial intelligence technologies are
   among the most promising ways to improve the environment. Automatic
   control systems solve a number of problems related to reducing costs and
   resources, full use of renewable energy sources, improving the safety of
   energy systems, and many others.
   The purpose of this article is to determine the functionality of
   artificial intelligence technologies and ways of their application in
   green construction. To solve this problem, methods of analysis and
   synthesis of existing information models were applied. The article
   discloses automatic control systems in the design, construction, and
   operation of buildings. These include well-known methods, such as
   Building Information Model, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and
   narrow-profile ones: Response Surface Methodology, Multi-Agent System,
   Digital Twins, etc. In addition, the study states that when planning and
   arranging green buildings must adhere to the following principles: high
   energy efficiency, rational use of natural resources, adaptation to the
   environment and climate, ensuring comfort and safety for residents. The
   article presents the standards of green construction existing in the
   world. This work can serve as a guide when choosing information models
   and is of practical value in the development of green buildings.},

Abstract = {Objective: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive
   malignancy. CD8+ T cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), and tumor budding
   (TB) have been significantly correlated with the outcome of patients
   with PDAC, but the correlations have been independently reported. In
   addition, no integrated immune-CSC-TB profile for predicting survival in
   patients with PDAC has been established. Methods: Multiplexed
   immunofluorescence and artificial intelligence (AI)-based comprehensive
   analyses were used for quantification and spatial distribution analysis
   of CD8+ T cells, CD133+ CSCs, and TB. In vivo humanized patient-derived
   xenograft (PDX) models were established. Nomogram analysis, calibration
   curve, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, and
   decision curve analyses were performed using R software. Results: The
   established `anti-/pro-tumor' models showed that the CD8+ T cell/TB,
   CD8+ T cell/CD133+ CSC, TB-adjacent CD8+ T cell, and CD133+ CSC-adjacent
   CD8+ T cell indices were positively associated with survival of patients
   with PDAC. These findings were validated using PDX-transplanted
   humanized mouse models. An integrated nomogram-based immune-CSC-TB
   profile that included the CD8+ T cell/TB and CD8+ T cell/CD133+ CSC
   indices was established and shown to be superior to the tumor-node
   -metastasis stage model in predicting survival of patients with PDAC.
   Conclusions: `Anti-/pro-tumor' models and the spatial relationship among
   CD8+ T cells, CSCs, and TB within the tumor microenvironment were
   investigated. Novel strategies to predict the prognosis of patients with
   PDAC were established using AI-based comprehensive analysis and machine
   learning workflow. The nomogram-based immune-CSC-TB profile can provide
   accurate prognosis prediction for patients with PDAC.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) plays an important role gathering data in many
   critical domains (e.g., global climate change, risk assessment and
   vulnerability reduction of natural hazards, resilience of ecosystems,
   and urban planning). Retrieving, managing, and analyzing large amounts
   of RS imagery poses substantial challenges. Google Earth Engine (GEE)
   provides a scalable, cloud-based, geospatial retrieval and processing
   platform. GEE also provides access to the vast majority of freely
   available, public, multi-temporal RS data and offers free cloud-based
   computational power for geospatial data analysis. Artificial
   intelligence (AI) methods are a critical enabling technology to
   automating the interpretation of RS imagery, particularly on
   object-based domains, so the integration of AI methods into GEE
   represents a promising path towards operationalizing automated RS-based
   monitoring programs. In this article, we provide a systematic review of
   relevant literature to identify recent research that incorporates AI
   methods in GEE. We then discuss some of the major challenges of
   integrating GEE and AI and identify several priorities for future
   research. We developed an interactive web application designed to allow
   readers to intuitively and dynamically review the publications included
   in this literature review.},

Title = {The Impact of Wireless Network Mobile Devices on College Students'
   Labour Concept Education in Artificial Intelligence Environment},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {To cultivate correct labour values and good labour quality of college
   students and effectively promote the development of their labour concept
   education, this work explores the impact of wireless network mobile
   devices on college students' labour concept education under the
   environment of artificial intelligence. Firstly, a questionnaire survey
   is used to investigate the labour concept of 400 college students.
   Secondly, the impact of wireless network mobile devices on college
   students' labour education is obtained by comparing group A (using
   artificial intelligence APPs for wireless network devices to learn about
   labour concepts) and group B (using traditional classroom teaching
   methods for to learn about labour concepts). According to the
   statistical survey results, about 20\% of college students agree that
   ``if they have enough money to live, they do not have to work{''}; while
   less than 50\% agree that ``they cannot be admitted to civil servants
   and senior managers in the company and are willing to engage in ordinary
   labour in the future{''}. Meanwhile, about 50\%-60\% of college students
   think that ``housework has nothing to do with me, and it's all the work
   of adults{''}. In the question ``What would you do when you find that
   the public area is dirty and poor, but it's not your turn to be on
   duty?{''}, only about 50\% of college students are willing to clean
   actively. Comparing the data of group A and group B suggests that the
   labour view expressed in group A is more biased in the cognition of
   labour purpose, and students in group A is more negative and lazier in
   labour attitude and labour habits, which shows that wireless network
   mobile devices have a great negative impact on the overall labour view
   of college students. Therefore, it is revealed in this work that the
   correct use of artificial intelligence technology in the education of
   labour concept has extremely important value for the intelligent
   development of education methods.},

Abstract = {Structural heart disease (SHD) is a new field within cardiovascular
   medicine. Traditional imaging modalities fall short in supporting the
   needs of SHD interventions, as they have been constructed around the
   concept of disease diagnosis. SHD interventions disrupt traditional
   concepts of imaging in requiring imaging to plan, simulate, and predict
   intraprocedural outcomes. In transcatheter SHD interventions, the
   absence of a gold-standard open cavity surgical field deprives
   physicians of the opportunity for tactile feedback and visual
   confirmation of cardiac anatomy. Hence, dependency on imaging in
   periprocedural guidance has led to evolution of a new generation of
   procedural skillsets, concept of a visual field, and technologies in the
   periprocedural planning period to accelerate preclinical device
   development, physician, and patient education. Adaptation of
   3-dimensional (3D) printing in clinical care and procedural planning has
   demonstrated a reduction in early-operator learning curve for
   transcatheter interventions. Integration of computation modeling to 3D
   printing has accelerated research and development understanding of fluid
   mechanics within device testing. Application of 3D printing,
   computational modeling, and ultimately incorporation of artificial
   intelligence is changing the landscape of physician training and
   delivery of patient-centric care. Transcatheter structural heart
   interventions are requiring in-depth periprocedural understanding of
   cardiac pathophysiotogy and device interactions not afforded by
   traditional imaging metrics. (C) 2021 by the American College of

Title = {Impact of artificial intelligence on clinical radiography practice:
   Futuristic prospects in a low resource setting},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {S1, S1},
Pages = {S69-S73},
Abstract = {Objectives: Current trends in clinical radiography practice include the
   integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and related applications to
   improve patient care and enhance research. However, in low resource
   countries there are unique barriers to the process of AI integration.
   Using Ghana as a case study, this paper seeks to discuss the potential
   impact of AI on future radiographic practice in low-resource settings.
   The opportunities, challenges and the way forward to optimise the
   potential benefits of AI in future practice within these settings have
   been explored.
   Key findings: Some of the barriers to AI integration into radiographic
   practice relate to lack of regulatory and legal policy frameworks and
   limited resource availability including unreliable internet connectivity
   and low expert skillset.
   Conclusion: These barriers notwithstanding, AI presents a great
   potential to the growth of medical imaging and subsequently improving
   quality of healthcare delivery in the near future. For example,
   AI-enabled radiographer reporting has a potential to improving quality
   of healthcare, especially in low-resource settings like Ghana with an
   acute shortage of radiologists. In addition, futuristic AI-enabled
   advancements such as synthetic cross-modality transfer where images from
   one modality are used as a baseline to generate a corresponding image of
   another modality without the need for additional scanning will be of
   particular benefit in low-resource settings. (C) 2021 The College of

Title = {Artificial intelligence in paediatric radiology: international survey of
   health care professionals' opinions},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-41},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background The nature of paediatric radiology work poses several
   challenges for developing and implementing artificial intelligence (AI)
   tools, but opinions of those working in the field are currently unknown.
   Objective To evaluate the attitudes and perceptions toward AI amongst
   health care professionals working within children's imaging services.
   Materials and methods A web-based questionnaire was distributed to the
   membership of several paediatric and general radiological societies over
   a 4-month period (1 Feb - 31 May 2020). Survey questions covered
   attitudes toward AI in general, future impacts and suggested areas for
   development specifically within paediatric imaging. Results Two hundred
   and forty responses were collected with the majority being from
   radiologists (159/240, 66.3\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   59.8-72.2\%) or allied health care professionals (72/240, 31.3\%; 95\%
   CI 25.4-37.5\%). Respondents agreed that AI could potentially alert
   radiologists to imaging abnormalities (148/240, 61.7\%; 95\% CI
   55.2-67.9\%) but preferred that results were checked by a human
   (200/240, 83.3\%; 95\% CI 78.0-87.8\%). The majority did not believe
   jobs in paediatric radiology would be replaced by AI (205/240, 85.4\%;
   95\% CI 80.3-89.6\%) and that the development of AI tools should focus
   on improved diagnostic accuracy (77/240, 32.1\%; 95\% CI 26.2-38.4\%),
   workflow efficiencies (60/240, 25.0\%; 95\% CI 19.7-30.9\%) and patient
   safety (54/240, 22.5\%; 95\% CI 17.4-28.3\%). The majority of European
   Society of Paediatric Radiology (ESPR) members (67/81, 82.7\%; 95\% CI
   72.7-90.2\%) welcomed the idea of a dedicated paediatric radiology AI
   task force with emphasis on educational events and anonymised dataset
   curation. Conclusion Imaging health care professionals working with
   children had a positive outlook regarding the use of AI in paediatric
   radiology, and did not feel their jobs were threatened. Future AI tools
   would be most beneficial for easily automated tasks and most
   practitioners welcomed the opportunity for further AI educational
   activities.},

Abstract = {Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging modality in clinical
   practice because it is a nonionizing, low-cost, and portable
   point-of-care imaging tool that provides real-time images. Artificial
   intelligence (AI)-powered ultrasound is becoming more mature and getting
   closer to routine clinical applications in recent times because of an
   increased need for efficient and objective acquisition and evaluation of
   ultrasound images. Because ultrasound images involve operator-,
   patient-, and scanner-dependent variations, the adaptation of classical
   machine learning methods to clinical applications becomes challenging.
   With their self-learning ability, deep-learning (DL) methods are able to
   harness exponentially growing graphics processing unit computing power
   to identify abstract and complex imaging features. This has given rise
   to tremendous opportunities such as providing robust and generalizable
   AI models for improving image acquisition, real-time assessment of image
   quality, objective diagnosis and detection of diseases, and optimizing
   ultrasound clinical workflow. In this report, the authors review current
   DL approaches and research directions in rapidly advancing ultrasound
   technology and present their outlook on future directions and trends for
   DL techniques to further improve diagnosis, reduce health care cost, and
   optimize ultrasound clinical workflow.},

Abstract = {The student's political and ideological practices is a vital portion of
   education, and it is related to optimization of task based on
   fundamental scenario in establishing morality. In order to establish a
   scientific, reasonable and operable evaluation model for students'
   ideological education, and evaluate the status of college students'
   ideological education. In this paper, firstly, in view of the
   shortcomings of evaluation objectives, single evaluation methods, lack
   of pertinence of evaluation indicators and subjectivity of evaluation
   standards in the current evaluation system of university students'
   ideological and political education, the basic principles for
   constructing evaluation models of university students' ideological and
   political education are put forward. Secondly, in case to meet changing
   needs of the times, an artificial neural network algorithm based on
   artificial intelligence data mining and a traditional multi-layer fuzzy
   evaluation model are designed to evaluate the ideological and political
   education of college students. This newly proposed model integrates
   learning, association, recognition, self-adaptive and fuzzy information
   processing, and at the same time, it overcomes their respective
   shortcomings. Finally, an example analysis is carried out with a nearby
   university as an example. The evaluation results display that the
   evaluation model of students' ideological education established in this
   paper is in good agreement with the previous evaluation results. It
   fully shows that the comprehensive evaluation model of fuzzy neural
   network for college students' ideological and political education
   established in this paper is scientific and effective.},

Abstract = {Among innovative e-learning approaches in the sphere of digital economy
   and logistics, there is a special focus on artificial intelligence
   technologies (AI), which, due to their capacity and efficiency in usage,
   have a significant potential for the development and to some extent are
   optimal IT tools. The objective of a study is to define an optimum IT
   software for the organization of massive open online courses (MOOC) in
   digital economy and digital logistics in the framework of training
   economics students. Authors have conducted a survey in terms of Internet
   use for education and self-education. The sampling volume makes up 1 600
   respondents in at least 80 regions of the Russian Federation. The
   respondents are divided into four age groups: 18-24 years old, 25-39
   years old, 40-54 years old, 55 years old and older. The study uses data
   from the survey conducted by KMDA.PRO related to digital transformation
   of 700 representatives from more than 300 Russian companies out of 15
   industries and the results of in-depth interviews of four categories of
   employees: top managers, heads of units, mid-level managers and other
   employees. The study results testify to the need for transforming
   e-learning approaches, taking into account the new labor market
   requirements for training specialists in digital logistics and gaining
   respective skills such as an active training, coordination, negotiation
   skills, teaching others, information literacy, customer focus, oral
   communication, ability to solve complex issues, operational literacy,
   time management. The use of the research results in practice is possible
   in case of the organization of online training courses for economics
   students in the framework of the higher educational system.},

Title = {Application of Artificial Intelligence in Static Formation Temperature
   Estimation},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 29},
Abstract = {This study presents a new model to predict the static formation
   temperature in multiple geothermal fields using multiple machine
   learning algorithms. Both artificial intelligence and non-artificial
   intelligent algorithms were used for this prediction. The model
   developed in this study predicts static formation temperature using
   several machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural
   networks, fuzzy logic, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest
   algorithms. Results are compared with the real temperatures obtained
   from two geothermal wells. The random forest, fuzzy logic, and k-nearest
   neighbors algorithms outperformed the artificial neural network, with
   the random forest algorithm achieving higher accuracy. The MAE of the
   random forest algorithm was 0.7\% and the RMSE was 0.9\%. The MAE values
   for the other machine learning algorithms ranging from 1.5 to 8.4\%, and
   the RMSE values ranged from 2 to 20.8\%. Artificial intelligence methods
   were found to be more accurate than non-artificial intelligence
   (mathematical) methods, with varying percentages. The results generated
   by the unique new model computation and the measured test data are
   substantially matched when compared to computed data and observed
   temperature data. The novelty of this newly developed artificial
   intelligence model is that it serves as a practical and inexpensive tool
   for static formation temperature determination in geothermal and
   petroleum wells.},

Title = {Assessment of Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial
   Intelligence among Healthcare Students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {MEDICINA-LITHUANIA},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Background and Objective: The role of the pharmacist in healthcare
   society is unique, since they are providers of health information and
   medication counseling to patients. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate
   Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial intelligence
   (AI) among pharmacy undergraduate students at King Saud University
   (KSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional,
   questionnaire-based study was conducted between December 2022 and
   January 2023 using online questionnaires. The data collection was
   carried out using convenience sampling methods among senior pharmacy
   students at the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University. Statistical
   Package for the Social Sciences version 26 was used to analyze the data
   (SPSS). Results: A total of one hundred and fifty-seven pharmacy
   students completed the questionnaires. Of these, most of them (n = 118;
   75.2\%) were males. About 42\%, (n = 65) were in their fourth year of
   study. Most of the students (n = 116; 73.9\%) knew about AI. In
   addition, 69.4\% (n = 109) of the students thought that AI is a tool
   that helps healthcare professionals (HCP). However, more than half
   57.3\% (n = 90) of the students were aware that AI would assist
   healthcare professionals in becoming better with the widespread use of
   AI. Furthermore, 75.1\% of the students agreed that AI reduces errors in
   medical practice. The mean positive perception score was 29.8 (SD =
   9.63; range-0-38). The mean score was significantly associated with age
   (p = 0.030), year of study (p = 0.040), and nationality (p = 0.013). The
   gender of the participants was found to have no significant association
   with the mean positive perception score (p = 0.916). Conclusions:
   Overall, pharmacy students showed good awareness of AI in Saudi Arabia.
   Moreover, the majority of the students had positive perceptions about
   the concepts, benefits, and implementation of AI. Moreover, most
   students indicated that there is a need for more education and training
   in the field of AI. Consequently, early exposure to content related to
   AI in the curriculum of pharmacy is an important step to help in the
   wide use of these technologies in the graduates' future careers.},

Abstract = {This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement
   on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the
   ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging
   Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging
   Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine. Al has great potential to
   increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also
   carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based
   intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of
   systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and
   societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for
   patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed
   to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement
   highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should
   promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and
   harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. We believe AI
   should respect human rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy.
   It should be designed for maximum transparency and dependability.
   Ultimate responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human
   designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology
   community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for
   AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and
   should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain
   without those two attributes.},

Abstract = {Background With the development of digital pathology and the renewal of
   deep learning algorithm, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied
   in tumor pathology. Previous researches have demonstrated that AI-based
   tumor pathology may help to solve the challenges faced by traditional
   pathology. This technology has attracted the attention of scholars in
   many fields and a large amount of articles have been published. This
   study mainly summarizes the knowledge structure of AI-based tumor
   pathology through bibliometric analysis, and discusses the potential
   research trends and foci. Methods Publications related to AI-based tumor
   pathology from 1999 to 2021 were selected from Web of Science Core
   Collection. VOSviewer and Citespace were mainly used to perform and
   visualize co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of
   countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field.
   Results A total of 2753 papers were included. The papers on AI-based
   tumor pathology research had been continuously increased since 1999. The
   United States made the largest contribution in this field, in terms of
   publications (1138, 41.34\%), H-index (85) and total citations (35,539
   times). We identified the most productive institution and author were
   Harvard Medical School and Madabhushi Anant, while Jemal Ahmedin was the
   most co-cited author. Scientific Reports was the most prominent journal
   and after analysis, Lecture Notes in Computer Science was the journal
   with highest total link strength. According to the result of references
   and keywords analysis, ``breast cancer histopathology{''}
   ``convolutional neural network{''} and ``histopathological image{''}
   were identified as the major future research foci. Conclusions AI-based
   tumor pathology is in the stage of vigorous development and has a bright
   prospect. International transboundary cooperation among countries and
   institutions should be strengthened in the future. It is foreseeable
   that more research foci will be lied in the interpretability of deep
   learning-based model and the development of multi-modal fusion model.},

Title = {Cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence screening for diabetic
   retinopathy in rural China},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become a leading cause of
   global blindness as a microvascular complication of diabetes. Regular
   screening of diabetic retinopathy is strongly recommended for people
   with diabetes so that timely treatment can be provided to reduce the
   incidence of visual impairment. However, DR screening is not well
   carried out due to lack of eye care facilities, especially in the rural
   areas of China. Artificial intelligence (AI) based DR screening has
   emerged as a novel strategy and show promising diagnostic performance in
   sensitivity and specificity, relieving the pressure of the shortage of
   facilities and ophthalmologists because of its quick and accurate
   diagnosis. In this study, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of AI
   screening for DR in rural China based on Markov model, providing
   evidence for extending use of AI screening for DR. Methods We estimated
   the cost-effectiveness of AI screening and compared it with
   ophthalmologist screening in which fundus images are evaluated by
   ophthalmologists. We developed a Markov model-based hybrid decision tree
   to analyze the costs, effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness
   ratio (ICER) of AI screening strategies relative to no screening
   strategies and ophthalmologist screening strategies (dominated) over 35
   years (mean life expectancy of diabetes patients in rural China). The
   analysis was conducted from the health system perspective (included
   direct medical costs) and societal perspective (included medical and
   nonmedical costs). Effectiveness was analyzed with quality-adjusted life
   years (QALYs). The robustness of results was estimated by performing
   one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis. Results From
   the health system perspective, AI screening and ophthalmologist
   screening had incremental costs of \$180.19 and \$215.05 but more
   quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with no screening. AI
   screening had an ICER of \$1,107.63. From the societal perspective which
   considers all direct and indirect costs, AI screening had an ICER of
   \$10,347.12 compared with no screening, below the cost-effective
   threshold (1-3 times per capita GDP of Chinese in 2019). Conclusions Our
   analysis demonstrates that AI-based screening is more cost-effective
   compared with conventional ophthalmologist screening and holds great
   promise to be an alternative approach for DR screening in the rural area
   of China.},

Abstract = {In this study, an Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based
   automated picking system was proposed for the development of an online
   shop and the services for automated shipping systems. Speed and
   convenience are two key points in Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0. In the
   context of online shopping, speed and convenience can be provided by
   integrating e-commerce platforms with AIoT systems and robots that are
   following consumers' needs. Therefore, this proposed system diverts
   consumers who are moved by AIoT, while robotic manipulators replace
   human tasks to pick. To prove this idea, we implemented a modified YOLO
   (You Only Look Once) algorithm as a detection and localization tool for
   items purchased by consumers. At the same time, the modified YOLOv2 with
   data-driven mode was used for the process of taking goods from
   unstructured shop shelves. Our system performance is proven by
   experiments to meet the expectations in evaluating efficiency, speed,
   and convenience of the system in Society 5.0's context.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {211-221},
Abstract = {The use of argument diagrams to foster argumentation has been an object
   of research in education, as a way to support students' argumentative
   interaction and, potentially, learning. In this paper it is shown how
   argument analysis and evaluation assisted by means of argument
   diagramming tools, further developed in artificial intelligence (AI),
   can also support the assessment of argumentation skills in the
   classroom. A case study is presented to show how informal logic
   contributions on fallacies, in particular, can be combined with the data
   of an argument-diagramming task, to form a method of assessing students'
   weaknesses in reasoning about everyday issues using argument maps. Our
   contribution is mainly methodological, as we suggest an application of
   AI and argumentation theories in education. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of
   public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and
   the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence
   systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a
   software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value
   (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the
   Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or
   government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are
   trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be
   trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas
   private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains
   are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers,
   with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording
   transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda,
   Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics
   and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial
   intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together
   with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is
   its role in creating ``clean data{''}: validated, trustable,
   interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop
   across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes,
   and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset
   pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt
   and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in
   global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity
   credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties),
   and asset tokens (Primalbase).},

Abstract = {This is a condensed summary of an international multisociety statement
   on ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology produced by the
   ACR, European Society of Radiology, RSNA, Society for Imaging
   Informatics in Medicine, European Society of Medical Imaging
   Informatics, Canadian Association of Radiologists, and American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine. AI has great potential to
   increase efficiency and accuracy throughout radiology, but it also
   carries inherent pitfalls and biases. Widespread use of AI-based
   intelligent and autonomous systems in radiology can increase the risk of
   systemic errors with high consequence and highlights complex ethical and
   societal issues. Currently, there is little experience using AI for
   patient care in diverse clinical settings. Extensive research is needed
   to understand how to best deploy AI in clinical practice. This statement
   highlights our consensus that ethical use of AI in radiology should
   promote well-being, minimize harm, and ensure that the benefits and
   harms are distributed among stakeholders in a just manner. respect human
   rights and freedoms, including dignity and privacy. It should be
   designed for maximum transparency and dependability. Ultimate
   responsibility and accountability for AI remains with its human
   designers and operators for the foreseeable future. The radiology
   community should start now to develop codes of ethics and practice for
   AI that promote any use that helps patients and the common good and
   should block use of radiology data and algorithms for financial gain
   without those two attributes. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {This article reviews current limitations and future opportunities for
   the application of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems and artificial
   intelligence in breast imaging. Traditional CAD systems in mammography
   screening have followed a rules-based approach, incorporating domain
   knowledge into hand-crafted features before using classical machine
   learning techniques as a classifier. The first commercial CAD system,
   ImageChecker M1000, relies on computer vision techniques for pattern
   recognition. Unfortunately, CAD systems have been shown to adversely
   affect some radiologists' performance and increase recall rates. The
   Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge was a multidisciplinary
   collaboration that provided 640,000 mammography images for teams to help
   decrease false-positive rates in breast cancer screening. Winning
   solutions leveraged deep learning's (DL) automatic hierarchical feature
   learning capabilities and used convolutional neural networks. Start-ups
   Therapixel and Kheiron Medical Technologies are using DL for breast
   cancer screening. With increasing use of digital breast tomosynthesis,
   specific artificial intelligence (AI)-CAD systems are emerging to
   include iCAD's PowerLook Tomo Detection and ScreenPoint Medical's
   Transpara. Other Al-CAD systems are focusing on breast diagnostic
   techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   There is a gap in the market for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography
   Al-CAD tools. Clinical implementation of Al-CAD tools requires testing
   in scenarios mimicking real life to prove its usefulness in the clinical
   environment. This requires a large and representative dataset for
   testing and assessment of the reader's interaction with the tools. A
   cost-effectiveness assessment should be undertaken, with a large
   feasibility study carried out to ensure there are no unintended
   consequences. Al-CAD systems should incorporate explainable Al in
   accordance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR). (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by

Title = {Assessment of MRI technologists in acceptance and willingness to
   integrate artificial intelligence into practice},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {S1, S1},
Pages = {S83-S87},
Abstract = {Introduction: The integration of AI in medical imaging has tremendous
   exponential growth, especially in image production, image processing and
   image interpretation. It is expected that radiographers working across
   all imaging modalities have adequate knowledge as they are part of the
   end-user team. The current study aimed to investigate the knowledge,
   willingness and challenges facing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
   technologists in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into
   MRI practice.
   Methods: Total of 120 participants were recruited using a snowball
   sampling technique. A two-phase study was undertaken using survey and
   focus group discussion (FGD) to capture participants' knowledge,
   interpretations, needs and obstacles toward AI integrations in MRI
   practice. The survey and FGD provided the base to understand the
   participant's' knowledge, acceptance and needs for AI.
   Results: Results showed medium to high knowledge, excitement about AI
   integration without disturbance of MRI practice. Participants thought
   that AI can improve MRI protocol selection (91.8\%), reduce the scan
   time (65.3\%), and improve image post-processing (79.5\%). Education and
   learning resources concerning AI were the main obstacles facing MRI
   technologists.
   Conclusion: MRI technologists have the knowledge and possess basic
   technical information. The application of AI in MRI practice might
   greatly influence and improve MRI technologist's work. A structured and
   professional program should be integrated in both undergraduate and
   continuous education to prepare for effective AI implementation.
   Implications for practice: Application of AI in MRI can be used in many
   aspects, such as optimize image quality and avoidance of image
   artifacts. Moreover, AI can play an important role in patient's safety
   at the MRI unit to reduce incidents. Education, infrastructure, and
   knowledge of end-users are keys for the incorporation of AI use,
   development and optimisation. (C) 2021 The College of Radiographers.

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming indispensable
   tools in many areas of physics, including astrophysics, particle
   physics, and climate science. In the arena of quantum materials, the
   rise of new experimental and computational techniques has increased the
   volume and the speed with which data are collected, and artificial
   intelligence is poised to impact the exploration of new materials such
   as superconductors, spin liquids, and topological insulators. This
   review outlines how the use of data-driven approaches is changing the
   landscape of quantum materials research. From rapid construction and
   analysis of computational and experimental databases to implementing
   physical models as pathfinding guidelines for autonomous experiments, we
   show that artificial intelligence is already well on its way to becoming
   the lynchpin in the search and discovery of quantum materials.
   Quantum materials host many exotic properties, which might be utilized
   for new electronic devices. Here, artificial intelligence for the
   discovery of quantum materials is discussed, covering both materials and
   property prediction, and high-throughput synthesis.},

Abstract = {Key findings, analysis and recommendations that have emerged from a
   research project, `Using Human Language Technology to enhance academic
   integrity, inclusivity, knowledge exchange, student diversity and
   retention' at the University of South Australia conducted in 2019 are

   address some of the challenges and opportunities afforded by increasing
   student and teacher diversity at a predominantly English-medium
   Australian university through newly enhanced human language translation
   technology (HLT) also known as machine translation (MT). This technology
   is frequently used for the translation of human language, and it falls
   under the umbrella of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. From
   the institution's perspective, key aims of the project were to
   contribute to the university's Digital Learning Strategy priorities and
   core values embedded in a structural transformation of the university.
   These include integrity, accountability, diversity, social justice,
   engagement and collaboration. The researchers' objectives focussed on
   multilingual pedagogics using HLT to support knowledge exchange
   (transknowledging), and translanguaging for all students. These disrupt
   inequitable hierarchies, and position bi-/multilingual students as
   valuable resources for monolingual staff and students.},

Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 31},
Abstract = {PurposeDespite the sporadic evolution of artificial intelligence, the
   most valuable asset of any organization in the modern world is human
   resources. This study aims to reveal that partnerships between higher
   education institutions (HEIs) and employers will ease the process of
   employee mid-career development in Uganda's corporate employment sector
   by promoting work-based postgraduate training, and this additionally
   promotes human resources (HR) capacity-building for
   organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe hypothesis is that
   contemporary employees seek out an academic mid-career development
   postgraduate programme that is blended to fit into the employees' work
   schedule. The study was a descriptive quantitative study, and a
   closed-ended questionnaire was sent out to groups of corporate employees
   online (N = 70) and 41 responded, giving a response rate of
   58.5\%.FindingsFindings indicate a need for a flexible program for
   mid-career development and transition, the low standard deviation of
   (Neutral = 0.95, Disagreed = 2.64 and Agreed = 3.3) implies an
   insignificant deviation from the mean of responses. Indeed, over 95\%
   agree that pursue further studies is needed but in a more flexible
   way.Research limitations/implicationsThe study design was limited by the
   sample selection process and study design. In the future, the authors
   recommend a mixed study for both quantitative and qualitative dimensions
   of such studies.Practical implicationsIrrespective of gender, hierarchy
   and experience, employees want flexible study modes for their
   postgraduate. This implies that institutions of higher learning should
   work with the labour industry and position themselves as work-based
   information and communication technology (ICT)-Integrated learning
   theatres.Originality/valueThe move towards a collaborative strategy
   between academia and the employment industry is very evident in this
   study.},

Title = {Piano Teaching Improvement Based on Machine Learning and Artificial

Abstract = {With the development of modern piano and the increasing demand of people
   for music hobbies, the traditional piano teaching mode had exposed more
   and more problems. Artificial intelligence accelerated the development
   of music education to a certain extent and effectively improved the
   teaching effect of teachers to piano lovers. If artificial intelligence
   and machine learning were organically integrated, the application of
   intelligent piano can be more wide. Therefore, this paper proposed a
   piano teaching model based on machine learning and artificial
   intelligence, which aimed to provide support for improving the quality
   of piano teaching. Firstly, based on the analysis of machine
   learning-related theories, this paper expounded the characteristics of
   neural network in data processing and gave the process of the
   integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence and its
   application advantages in music teaching. Secondly, according to the
   interactive needs between intelligent piano and learners, this paper put
   forward intelligent piano teaching assistance methods and constructed an
   intelligent piano teaching service management system by improving the
   teaching information resource base. Finally, it analyzed the influence
   of artificial intelligence on piano teaching from different angles. In
   order to test the effectiveness of the piano teaching mode proposed in
   this paper, the piano learners under different teaching modes were
   investigated and counted. From the piano teaching effect and the
   evaluation results of the piano practitioners on the teaching mode, it
   was known that compared with the traditional piano teaching mode, the
   piano teaching mode proposed in this paper had achieved remarkable
   results in both theoretical teaching and practical operation. It can
   significantly improve the quality of piano teaching and promote the
   enthusiasm of learners.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence-enhanced seismic response prediction of
   reinforced concrete frames},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {52},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Existing physics-based modeling approaches do not have a good compromise
   between performance and computational efficiency in predicting the
   seismic response of reinforced concrete (RC) frames, where highfidelity
   models (e.g., fiber-based modeling method) have reasonable predictive
   performance but are computationally demanding, while more simplified
   models (e.g., shear building model) are the opposite. This paper
   proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced computational
   method for seismic response prediction of RC frames which can remedy
   these problems. The proposed AI-enhanced method incorporates an AI
   technique with a shear building model, where the AI technique can
   directly utilize the real-world experimental data of RC columns to
   determine the lateral stiffness of each column in the target RC frame
   while the structural stiffness matrix is efficiently formulated via the
   shear building model. Therefore, this scheme can enhance prediction
   accuracy due to the use of real-world data while maintaining high
   computational efficiency due to the incorporation of the shear building
   model. Two data-driven seismic response solvers are developed to
   implement the proposed approach based on a database including 272 RC
   column specimens. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the
   experimental data, the proposed method outperforms the fiber-based
   modeling approach in both prediction capability and computational
   efficiency and is a promising tool for accurate and efficient seismic
   response prediction of structural systems.},

Title = {Ozone Concentration Forecasting Based on Artificial Intelligence
   Techniques: A Systematic Review},
Journal = {WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {232},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 13},
Abstract = {The prediction of tropospheric ozone concentrations is vital due to
   ozone's passive impacts on atmosphere, people's health, flora and fauna.
   However, ozone prediction is a complex process and the wide range of
   traditional models is incapable to obtain an accurate prediction.
   ``Artificial intelligence{''}, ``machine learning{''} and ``ozone
   prediction model{''} search terms in the title, abstract or keywords are
   involved. Inclusion criteria include subject area (engineering, computer
   science), English language and being published from 2015. This criterion
   obtained 156 articles, which were categorized into 4 areas of interest
   based on the machine learning technique applied. Recently as a result of
   the rapid development in the technology and the increase in the number
   of measured data, artificial intelligence techniques have been
   intensively used in predicting ozone concentration as an alternative to
   the traditional models. Therefore, the main objective of this study is
   to investigate the most developed techniques that have been used in
   predicting ozone concentrations as well as theoretic approaches such as
   information set approaches, fuzzy set approach and probabilistic set
   approaches. It is clearly stated that the standalone algorithms such as
   decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed
   multilayer perceptron (MLP); however, the latter is massively
   implemented by many researchers in the prediction of ozone
   concentrations. This review paper investigated artificial intelligence
   techniques integrated with optimization approaches. It can be concluded
   that hybrid algorithms have significantly improved the prediction
   accuracy. However, the majority of the proposed hybrid models have
   limitations; thus, there is a need to develop better hybrid algorithm
   that is able to tackle all the drawbacks of the improved algorithms and
   capable to capture the ozone concentration changes with a high level of
   accuracy.},

Title = {Is New Zealand's Higher Education Sector Ready to Employ Analytics
   Initiatives to Enhance its Decision-making Process?},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION},

Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Interest in the use of analytics to support evidence-based
   decision-making in higher education is relatively a new phenomenon. The
   available research suggests that analytics can enhance an institution's
   ability to make evidence-based informed decisions that foster growth and
   increased productivity. The present study explored how institutions of
   higher education in New Zealand value and utilise analytics to enhance
   the quality of decision-making. The study involved administering an
   online questionnaire (n = 82) to senior administrators from seven of the
   eight research-intensive public universities in New Zealand. Key
   findings revealed that the use of analytics in the higher education
   sector could enhance the quality of decision-making. Respondents
   reported that the use of analytics is likely to advance operational and
   strategic decisions by monitoring and efficiently optimising the use of
   resources. Respondents said that analytics provide better planning of
   issues about students (e.g. enrolment, retention, and completion rate).
   Furthermore, analytics can improve institutional research administration
   (e.g. performance outcomes in finance and human resources). Despite the
   stated benefits of analytics in enhancing decision-making in many
   operational and strategic areas, the study found that the use of
   analytics in the higher education sector in New Zealand is limited to
   monitoring operational activities, rather than improving the quality of
   learning, teaching and strategic initiatives. Further, the study
   identified several concerns regarding the ability of institutions to
   find the capacity and expertise to extract useful information from the
   available data sets and to turn such data into usable knowledge to
   support students and educators. Also, respondents were concerned that
   the lack of staff capacity and training to use analytics effectively
   could be detrimental. Others feared that analytics could be used as
   surveillance tools and enforce compliance and control. It was mentioned
   that over-reliance on analytics could easily lead to a breach of
   individuals' and institutional privacy, which is a threat to information
   and data security. Also, there was a concern that analytics could be
   used to perpetuate inequity and inequality among and within
   institutions. Results of the study presented in this article serve as a
   baseline for future studies about the use of analytics in the higher
   education sector in New Zealand. Additionally, it contributes to the
   growing debate about the value and challenges of deploying analytics and
   Big Data in the higher education sector worldwide.},

Title = {Teacher support and student motivation to learn with Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) based chatbot},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 2},
Abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) advances technologically, it will
   inevitably bring many changes to classroom practices. However, research
   on AI in education reflects a weak connection to pedagogical
   perspectives or instructional approaches, particularly in K-12
   education. AI technologies may benefit motivated and advanced students.
   Understanding the teacher's role of student motivation in mediating and
   supporting learning with AI technologies in the classroom is needed.
   This study used self-determination theory as the undergirding framework
   to investigate how teacher support moderates the effects of student
   expertise on needs satisfactions and intrinsic motivation to learn with
   AI technologies. This experimental study involved 123 Grade 10 students,
   and used chatbots as AI-based technologies in the experiment. The
   analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and competence to learn with
   the chatbot depended on both teacher support and student expertise (i.e.
   self-regulated learning and digital literacy), and the teacher support
   better satisfied the need for relatedness, and it less satisfied the
   need for autonomy. The findings refined our understanding about the
   application of self-determination theory and expand the pedagogical and
   design considerations of AI application and instructional practices.},

Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The application of AI in higher education has greatly increased globally
   in the dynamic digital age. The adoption of developmentally appropriate
   practices using AI-enabled techniques for facilitating the performance
   of teaching and learning in the higher education domain is thus a
   necessary task, especially in the COVID 19 pandemic era. The development
   and implementation of such techniques involve many factors and are
   related to the classical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) issue;
   however, these factors surrounding supervisors will confuse them and may
   result in misjudgment. To clarify the relevant issues and illustrate the
   cause-and -effect relationships among factors, a hybrid soft-computing
   technique (i.e., the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST) with ant colony
   optimization (ACO)) and a DEMATEL approach was proposed in this study,
   which can help decision makers capture the best model necessary for
   achieving aspiration-level in a higher education man-agement strategy.
   In the results submitted, the improvement priority for dimensions is
   based on the measurement of the influences, running in order of tutors
   for learners (A), skills and competences (B), interaction data to
   support learning (C), and universal access to global classrooms (D), and
   which can serve as a reference for the plan of AI-enabled

Title = {Artificial intelligence in radiography: Where are we now and what does
   the future hold?},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {S1, S1},
Pages = {S58-S62},
Abstract = {Objectives: This paper will outline the status and basic principles of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in radiography along with some thoughts and
   suggestions on what the future might hold. While the authors are not
   always able to separate the current status from future developments in
   this field, given the speed of innovation in AI, every effort has been
   made to give a view to the present with projections to the future.
   Key findings: AI is increasingly being integrated within radiography and
   radiographers will increasingly be working with AI based tools in the
   future. As new AI tools are developed it is essential that robust
   validation is undertaken in unseen data, supported by more prospective
   interdisciplinary research. A framework of stronger, more comprehensive
   approvals are recommended and the involvement of service users,
   including practitioners, patients and their carers in the design and
   implementation of AI tools is essential. Clearer accountability and
   medicolegal frameworks are required in cases of erroneous results from
   the use of AI-powered software and hardware. Clearer career pathways and
   role extension provision for healthcare practitioners, including
   radiographers, are required along with education in this field where AI
   will be central.
   Conclusion: With the current growth rate of AI tools it is expected that
   many of the applications in medical imaging will continue to develop to
   more accurate, less expensive and more readily available versions moving
   from the bench to the bedside. The hope is that, alongside efficiency
   and increased patient throughput, patient centred care and precision
   medicine will find their way in, so we will not only deliver a faster,
   safer, seamless clinical service but also one that will have the
   patients at its heart.
   Impact for practice: AI is already reaching clinical practice in many
   forms and its presence will continue to increase over the short and
   long-term future. Radiographers must learn to work with AI, embracing it
   and maximising the positive outcomes from this new technology. (C) 2021

Abstract = {In many academic fields, predicting student academic success using data
   mining techniques has long been a major research issue. Monitoring
   students in higher education institutions (HEIs) and having the ability
   to predict student performance is important to improve academic quality.
   The objective of the study is to (1) identify features that form
   clusters that have holistic characteristics and (2) develop and validate
   a prediction model for each of the clusters to predict student
   performance holistically. For this study, both classification and
   clustering methods will be used using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
   K-means clustering. Three clusters were identified using K-means
   clustering. Based on the learning program outcome feature, there are
   primarily three types of students: low, average, and high performance.
   The prediction model with the new labels obtained from the clusters also
   gained higher accuracy when compared to the student dataset with labels
   using their semester grade.},

Abstract = {Conventional traffic crash analysis methods often use highly aggregated
   data, making it difficult to understand the effects of time-varying
   factors on crash occurrence. In this study, the combined effect of
   roadway geometry, speed distribution, and weather conditions on crash
   occurrence and severity was investigated on short duration daily level
   crash data. This study collected data from four different sources on
   rural two-lane roadways in Texas. A machine learning method, XGBoost
   (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), was applied to train the data. To mitigate
   imbalanced data problems, a synthetic minority oversampling technique
   (SMOTE) was applied. The XGBoost model was trained separately on all
   crash occurrences and severe crash occurrences. Finally, an explainable
   artificial intelligence (AI) technique, SHAP (SHapley Additive
   exPlanation), was applied to investigate the contribution of all
   variables to the model's output. The results show that annual average
   daily traffic has a significant impact on all crash occurrences and
   severe crash (fatal and incapacitating injury) occurrences on rural
   two-lane roadways. Moreover, weather condition factors including daily
   precipitation, average visibility, and the standard deviation of
   visibility show association with high crash occurrences. The short
   duration crash prediction models of this study can provide more insights
   into the relationships between crash, geometric variables, traffic
   exposure, weather, and operating speed.},

   expert system to support the validation of academic credits in higher
   education institutions. For the system development were carried out
   activities of requirement elicitation, modeling and construction of SE
   knowledge base. For it's implementation were used the Java programming
   language by the integrated development environment NetBeans 7.2 and the
   database management system used was MySQL 5.5.27 server. The expert
   system developed has reached the goal proposed acting as an efficient
   tool for the specialist during the validation analysis of academic
   credits, featuring the average hit rate of 89.4\%.},

Title = {Development Countermeasures of College English Education Based on Deep
   Learning and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 22},
Abstract = {College English education aims at cultivating students' English
   application ability and promoting the development of students' English
   communication level. However, at present, many college students still
   stay in English learning to cope with the examination. The cultivation
   of oral English and other comprehensive ability is little. Therefore,
   the development direction of college English education should be based
   on the actual needs of students in social work and life, and formulate a
   plan more suitable for contemporary development needs. In this context,
   to better provide countermeasures for the development of college English
   education, this paper provides a new English education model based on
   artificial intelligence (AI), and evaluates students' comprehensive
   English ability through deep learning (DL). This paper not only
   constructs a college English teaching model and evaluation system
   through artificial intelligence methods but also evaluates the quality
   of English pronunciation through DBN. It also designs comparative
   experiments, and the consistency between manual evaluation and DBN-based
   evaluation is obtained. The results show that the English pronunciation
   evaluation system based on DBN has a high consistency with manual
   evaluation. Among them, in the speech rate evaluation, the adjacent
   consistency rate reaches 99.58\%, showing that the evaluation model
   constructed in this paper is effective and verifying the feasibility of
   applying the artificial intelligence method to college English
   education.},

   Smart Transport Systems},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A smart public transport system is expected to be an integral part of
   our human lives to improve our mobility and reduce the effect of our
   carbon footprint. The safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public
   transport system from cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide
   more comprehensive protection against potential cyberattacks, we propose
   a novel approach that combines blockchain technology and a deep learning
   method that can better protect the smart public transport system. By the
   creation of signed and verified blockchain blocks and chaining of hashed
   blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can withstand unauthorized
   integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport maintenance
   data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep learning-based
   method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer perceptron
   (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of
   service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical
   exchange of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The
   experimental results of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three
   different datasets (i.e., CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show
   that our deep learning model is effective to detect a wide range of DDoS
   attacks achieving more than 95\% F1-score across all three datasets in
   average. The comparison of our approach with other similar methods
   confirms that our approach covers a more comprehensive range of security
   properties for the smart public transport system.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) methods and AI-enabled metrics
   hold tremendous potential to advance surgical education. Our objective
   was to generate consensus guidance on specific needs for AI methods and
   AI-enabled metrics for surgical education.
   STUDY DESIGN: The study included a systematic literature search, a
   virtual conference, and a 3-round Delphi survey of 40 representative
   multidisciplinary stakeholders with domain expertise selected through
   purposeful sampling. The accelerated Delphi process was completed within
   10 days. The survey covered overall utility, anticipated future (10-year
   time horizon), and applications for surgical training, assessment, and
   feedback. Consensus was agreement among 80\% or more respondents. We
   coded survey questions into 11 themes and descriptively analyzed the
   responses.
   RESULTS: The respondents included surgeons (40\%), engineers (15\%),
   affiliates of industry (27.5\%), professional societies (7.5\%),
   regulatory agencies (7.5\%), and a lawyer (2.5\%). The survey included
   155 questions; consensus was achieved on 136 (87.7\%). The panel listed
   6 deliverables each for AI-enhanced learning curve analytics and
   surgical skill assessment. For feedback, the panel identified 10
   priority deliverables spanning 2-year (n = 2), 5-year (n = 4), and
   10-year (n = 4) time-frames. Within 2 years, the panel expects
   development of methods to recognize anatomy in images of the surgical
   field and to provide surgeons with performance feedback immediately
   after an operation. The panel also identified 5 essential that should be
   included in operative performance reports for surgeons.
   CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi panel consensus provides a specific, bold, and
   forward-looking roadmap for AI methods and AI-enabled metrics for
   surgical education. (C) 2022 by the American College of Surgeons.

Abstract = {Modern endoscopy relies on digital technology, from high-resolution
   imaging sensors and displays to electronics connecting configurable
   illumination and actuation systems for robotic articulation. In addition
   to enabling more effective diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the
   digitization of the procedural toolset enables video data capture of the
   internal human anatomy at unprecedented levels. Interventional video
   data encapsulate functional and structural information about a patient's
   anatomy as well as events, activity and action logs about the surgical
   process. This detailed but difficult-to-interpret record from endoscopic
   procedures can be linked to preoperative and postoperative records or
   patient imaging information. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence,
   especially in supervised deep learning, can utilize data from endoscopic
   procedures to develop systems for assisting procedures leading to
   computer-assisted interventions that can enable better navigation during
   procedures, automation of image interpretation and robotically assisted
   tool manipulation. In this Perspective, we summarize state-of-the-art
   artificial intelligence for computer-assisted interventions in
   gastroenterology and surgery.
   Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are changing endoscopy and

Title = {Quality Evaluation and Satisfaction Analysis of Online Learning of
   College Students Based on Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {In order to better study the quality and satisfaction of online learning
   of college students, this paper analyzes and researches online learning
   of college students based on relevant theories of artificial
   intelligence. Through the traditional machine learning method to
   evaluate the quality of online learning, the deep learning theory is
   applied to the satisfaction analysis of college students'' online
   learning. The results show that different statistical indexes have
   different influences on traditional machine learning, but they all show
   a gradually decreasing trend. The main reason for the different degrees
   of influence is that the emphasis of different statistical indexes is
   different, and the order from large to small is MAE > RMSE > MAPE > TIC.
   Statistical indicators can better describe the first stage of test data,
   while the corresponding quality indicators can better characterize the
   second stage of test data. It indicates that statistical and quality
   indexes should be considered comprehensively to analyze the test data
   accurately. The increase of evaluation indexes based on traditional
   machine learning can improve the evaluation indexes of online learning
   quality of college students. And the improvement of statistical
   indicators and evaluation factors can promote the accuracy of online
   learning quality evaluation of college students. Based on the theory of
   artificial intelligence, the quality and satisfaction of online learning
   of college students are analyzed and evaluated by using the traditional
   machine learning method and deep learning method, respectively. Relevant
   research can provide a research basis for artificial intelligence in
   online learning methods of college students.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-defined as a system's ability to correctly
   interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those
   learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible
   adaptation is a topic in nearly every boardroom and at many dinner
   tables. Yet, despite this prominence, Al-is still a surprisingly fuzzy
   concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this
   article, we analyze how Al is different from related concepts, such as
   the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that Al is not one
   monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This
   can either be achieved by looking at Al through the lens of evolutionary
   stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence,
   and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of
   Al systems (analytical Al, human-inspired AI, and humanized Al). Based
   on this classification, we show the potential and risk of Al using a
   series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and
   governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations
   think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label
   the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control. (C) 2018 Kelley

Abstract = {Universities in Latin America commonly gather much more information
   about their students than allowed by data protection regulations in
   other parts of the world. We have tackled the question of whether
   abundant socio-economic data can be harnessed for the purpose of
   predicting academic outcomes and, thereby, taking proactive actions in
   student attention, course planning and resource management. A study was
   conducted to analyze the data gathered by a private university in
   Ecuador over more than 20 years, to normalize them and to parameterize a
   Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network, whose best-performing
   configuration would be used as a benchmark for the comparison of more
   recent and sophisticated Artificial Intelligence techniques. However, an
   extensive scan of hyperparameters for the perceptron-exploring more than
   12,000 configurations-revealed no significant relationships between the
   input variables and the chosen metrics, suggesting that there is no gain
   from processing the extensive socio-economic data. This finding
   contradicts the expectations raised by previous works in the related
   literature and in some cases highlights important methodological flaws.},

Title = {Importance of artificial intelligence in evaluating climate change and
   food safety risk},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Climate change is considered primarily as a human-created phenomenon
   that is changing the way humans live. Nowhere are the impacts of climate
   change more evident than in the food ecosphere. Climate-induced changes
   in temperature, precipitation, and rain patterns, as well as extreme
   weather events have already started impacting the yield, quality, and
   safety of food. Food safety and the availability of food is a
   fundamental aspect of ensuring food security and an adequate standard of
   living. With climate change, there have been increasing instances of
   observed changes in the safety of food, particularly from a
   microbiological standpoint, as well as its quality and yield. Thus,
   there is an urgent need for the implementation of advanced methods to
   predict the food safety implications of climate change (i.e., future
   food safety issues) from a holistic perspective (overall food system).
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other such advanced technologies have,
   over the years, permeated many facets of the food chain, spanning both
   farm-(or ocean-) to-fork production, and food quality and safety testing
   and prediction. As a result, these are perfectly positioned to develop
   novel models to predict future climate change-induced food safety risks.
   This article provides a roundup of the latest research on the use of AI
   in the food industry, climate change and its impact on the food
   industry, as well as the social, ethical, and legal limitations of the
   same. Particularly, this perspective review stresses the importance of a
   holistic approach to food safety and quality prediction from a
   microbiological standpoint, encompassing diverse data streams to help
   stakeholders make the most informed decisions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 3},
Abstract = {This study aims to explore new educational strategies suitable for the
   mental health education of college students. Big data and artificial
   intelligence (AI) are combined to evaluate the mental health education
   of college students in sports majors. First, the research status on the
   mental health education of college students is introduced. The internet
   of things (IoT) on mental health education, a structure based on big
   data and convolutional neural network (CNN), is constructed. Next, the
   survey design and questionnaire survey are carried out. Finally, the
   questionnaire data are analyzed and compared with the mental health
   status under traditional education. The results show that the CNN model
   has good accuracy and ability to distinguish symptoms, so it can be
   applied to the existing psychological work in colleges. In the symptom
   comparison survey, under the traditional education and big data network,
   the number of college students with mild mental health problems is found
   to be 158 (84.9\%) and 170 (91.4\%), respectively. It indicates that the
   number of college students with moderate mental health problems
   decreases significantly. In the comparative investigation of the
   severity of mental problems, the number of students with normal mental
   health, subhealth, and serious mental health problems under the
   background of traditional mental health education is 125 (67.2\%), 56
   (30.1\%), and 5 (2.7\%), respectively. The mental health status of
   college students under the influence of big data networks on mental
   health education is better than that of traditional mental health
   education. There are 140 students with normal mental health, a
   year-on-year increase of 16.7\%. In the comparative survey of specific
   mental disorders, students with obsessive-compulsive symptoms under
   traditional mental health education account for 22.0\% of the total
   sample, having the largest proportion. In the subhealth psychological
   group under the big data network on mental health education, the number
   of hostile students decreases by 7, which is the psychological factor
   with the most obvious improvement. Hence, the proposed path of mental
   health education is feasible.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in radiation oncology: A review of its current
   status and potential application for the radiotherapy workforce},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {S1, S1},
Pages = {S63-S68},
Abstract = {Objective: Radiation oncology is a continually evolving speciality. With
   the development of new imaging modalities and advanced imaging
   processing techniques, there is an increasing amount of data available
   to practitioners. In this narrative review, Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   is used as a reference to machine learning, and its potential, along
   with current problems in the field of radiation oncology, are considered
   from a technical position.
   Key Findings: AI has the potential to harness the availability of data
   for improving patient outcomes, reducing toxicity, and easing clinical
   burdens. However, problems including the requirement of complexity of
   data, undefined core outcomes and limited generalisability are apparent.
   Conclusion: This original review highlights considerations for the
   radiotherapy workforce, particularly therapeutic radiographers, as there
   will be an increasing requirement for their familiarity with AI due to
   their unique position as the interface between imaging technology and
   patients.
   Implications for practice: Collaboration between AI experts and the
   radiotherapy workforce are required to overcome current issues before
   clinical adoption. The development of educational resources and
   standardised reporting of AI studies may help facilitate this. (C) 2021

Volume = {36},

Abstract = {In this paper the authors explore the implications for higher education
   of the disruptions caused by changes in the retail sector resulting from
   rapid developments in technology. Industry 4.0 technologies such as big
   data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, automation, robotics,
   artificial intelligence and virtual reality are increasingly evident in
   the retail sector. While predictions vary as to the extent of the
   disruption, retailers agree that embracing technology is now a
   necessity. The evidence in the paper is taken from a diverse sample of
   60 senior managers across 24 retail companies in Ireland. The authors
   adopt a mixed-methods approach to data collection. They report that the
   skills required to perform in retail now and in the future will be a
   combination of human, digital and traditional skills. What emerges from
   the study is that advances in technology necessitate the provision of
   new hard skills, but importantly reinforce the necessity for soft skills
   so that the potential of the new technology can be fully understood and
   utilised. Helping retail employees upskill and future proof is a major
   challenge for higher education. Retailers need to proactively develop
   their employees by identifying clear progression pathways and promoting
   careers in retail.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence in plastic surgery: What is it. Where are we

Journal = {ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Number = {8},
Pages = {577-580},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION An increasing quantity of data is required to guide
   precision medicine and advance future healthcare practices, but current
   analytical methods often become overwhelmed. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) provides a promising solution. Plastic surgery is an innovative
   surgical specialty expected to implement AI into current and future
   practices. It is important for all plastic surgeons to understand how AI
   may affect current and future practice, and to recognise its potential
   limitations.
   METHODS Peer-reviewed published literature and online content were
   comprehensively reviewed. We report current applications of AI in
   plastic surgery and possible future applications based on published
   literature and continuing scientific studies, and detail its potential
   limitations and ethical considerations.
   FINDINGS Current machine learning models using convolutional neural
   networks can evaluate breast mammography and differentiate benign and
   malignant tumours as accurately as specialist doctors, and motion sensor
   surgical instruments can collate real-time data to advise intraoperative
   technical adjustments. Centralised big data portals are expected to
   collate large datasets to accelerate understanding of disease
   pathogeneses and best practices.
   Information obtained using computer vision could guide intraoperative
   surgical decisions in unprecedented detail and semi-autonomous surgical
   systems guided by AI algorithms may enable improved surgical outcomes in
   low- and middle-income countries. Surgeons must collaborate with
   computer scientists to ensure that AI algorithms inform clinically
   relevant health objectives and are interpretable. Ethical concerns such
   as systematic biases causing non-representative conclusions for
   under-represented patient groups, patient confidentiality and the
   limitations of AI based on the quality of data input suggests that AI
   will accompany the plastic surgeon, rather than replace them.},

   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to
   substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help
   institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter
   related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19.
   Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of
   artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using
   tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in
   English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the
   study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
   sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network
   of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral,
   or negative sentiments. Geographic analysis of the tweets was also
   conducted.
   Results: There were a total of 14,180,603 likes, 863,411 replies,
   3,087,812 retweets, and 641,381 mentions in tweets during the study
   timeframe. Out of 902,138 tweets analyzed, sentiment analysis classified
   434,254 (48.2\%) tweets as having a positive sentiment, 187,042 (20.7\%)
   as neutral, and 280,842 (31.1\%) as negative. The study identified 5
   dominant themes among COVID-19-related tweets: health care environment,
   emotional support, business economy, social change, and psychological
   stress. Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Florida were the
   states expressing the most negative sentiment while Vermont, North
   Dakota, Utah, Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina conveyed the most
   positive sentiment.
   Conclusions: This study identified 5 prevalent themes of COVID-19
   discussion with sentiments ranging from positive to negative. These
   themes and sentiments can clarify the public's response to COVID-19 and
   help officials navigate the pandemic.},

   Classroom Behavior Analysis with Embedded Devices},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Modern education has undergone tremendous progress, and a large number
   of advanced devices and technologies have been introduced into the
   teaching process. We explore the application of artificial intelligence
   to education, using AI devices for classroom behavior analysis. Embedded
   systems are special-purpose computer systems tailored to an application.
   Embedded system hardware for wearable devices is often characterized by
   low computing power and small storage, and it cannot run complex models.
   We apply lightweight models to embedded devices to achieve real-time
   emotion recognition. When teachers teach in the classroom, embedded
   portable devices can collect images in real-time and identify and count
   students' emotions. Teachers can adjust teaching methods and obtain
   better teaching results through feedback on students' learning status.
   Our optimized lightweight model PIDM runs on low-computing embedded
   devices with fast response times and reliable accuracy, which can be
   effectively used in the classroom. Compared with traditional post-class
   analysis, our method is real-time and gives teachers timely feedback
   during teaching. The experiments in the control group showed that after
   using smart devices, the classroom teaching effect increased by 9.44\%.
   Intelligent embedded devices can help teachers keep abreast of students'
   learning status and promote the improvement of classroom teaching
   quality.},

Title = {Using Psychological Artificial Intelligence (Tess) to Relieve Symptoms
   of Depression and Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 13},
Abstract = {Background: Students in need of mental health care face many barriers
   including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that
   computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering
   cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more
   cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although
   CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an
   integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment
   improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI)
   offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient,
   lasting, and secure support grows.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of
   using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified
   symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.
   Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were
   recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All
   participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and
   Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks
   later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and
   were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks
   (n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group
   participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National
   Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college
   students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the
   study.
   Results: A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0\%
   attrition from the test group and less than 1\% attrition from the
   control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years,
   with 70\% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74,
   51\%), and white (32/74, 41\%). Group 1 received unlimited access to
   Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited
   access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only
   control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook.
   Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha
   level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically
   significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that
   group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as
   measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did
   not. A statistically significant difference was found between the
   control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as
   measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a
   significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group
   did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS
   between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did
   impact scores.
   Conclusions: This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a
   cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed
   to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative
   psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.

Title = {Artificial intelligence-assisted prediction of preeclampsia: Development
   and external validation of a nationwide health insurance dataset of the
   BPJS Kesehatan in Indonesia},
Journal = {EBIOMEDICINE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {54},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: We developed and validated an artificial intelligence
   (AI)-assisted prediction of preeclampsia applied to a nationwide health
   insurance dataset in Indonesia.
   Methods: The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a
   nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and
   normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one
   pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic
   variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and
   ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area
   under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a
   subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar
   prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we
   conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing
   techniques to interpret our modeling results.
   Findings: The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a
   random forest algorithm. Nine similar to 12 months to the event was the
   period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either
   geographical (0.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal
   split (0.86, 95\% CI 0.85-0.86). We compared this model to prediction
   models in seven studies from 869 records in PUBMED, EMBASE, and SCOPUS.
   This model outperformed the previous models in terms of the precision,
   sensitivity, and specificity in all validation sets.
   Interpretation: Our low-cost model improved preliminary prediction to
   decide pregnant women that will be predicted by the models with high
   specificity and advanced predictors. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Pervasive AI for IoT Applications: A Survey on Resource-Efficient

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a substantial breakthrough in
   a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services,
   spanning from recommendation systems and speech processing applications
   to robotics control and military surveillance. This is driven by the
   easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale of
   pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes of real-time data
   streams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to
   revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive
   computing as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life (e.g., smart
   homes and self-driving cars.). The confluence of pervasive computing and
   artificial intelligence, namely Pervasive AI, expanded the role of
   ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing
   distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized
   learning, presenting various challenges, including privacy and latency
   requirements. In this context, an intelligent resource scheduling should
   be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles) and
   infrastructure (e.g., edge nodes and base stations) to avoid
   communication and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance.
   In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent
   techniques and strategies developed to overcome these resource
   challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we first present an
   overview of pervasive computing, its architecture, and its intersection
   with artificial intelligence. We then review the background,
   applications and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning
   (DL) and reinforcement learning, running in a ubiquitous system. Next,
   we provide a deep literature review of communication-efficient
   techniques, from both algorithmic and system perspectives, of
   distributed training and inference across the combination of IoT
   devices, edge devices and cloud servers. Finally, we discuss our future
   vision and research challenges.},

Abstract = {The current education methods are mostly based on test-oriented
   education and rarely really care about the content of students'
   concerns, and flipped psychological education methods have appeared in
   some areas. The main purpose of this thesis is to combine artificial
   intelligence and flipped classroom psychology. This article mainly
   introduces the characteristics of artificial intelligence and the
   definition of flipped classroom. What are the advantages of the
   intelligent teaching platform compared to traditional teaching? This
   article selects key 1 class, key 2 class, key 3 class, and key 4 class
   from the students of our school. Groups A1 and B1 conduct a semester of
   artificial intelligence combined with the concept of flipped classroom
   psychology. Groups A2 and B2 teach students in accordance with
   traditional teaching. The experimental results show that the proportion
   of groups A1 and B1 increased by 8.2\% and 8.14\%. The midterm and final
   average scores of groups A1 and B1 are 10.87, 7.2, 14.13, and 12.2
   points higher than those of groups A2 and B2, and their scores have
   increased by 10.3\% and 7.02\%, 12.4\%, and 11.9\%. The mental health
   education course effect of artificial intelligence and flipped classroom
   psychology can more stimulate students' interest and promote the
   improvement of students' performance through autonomous learning.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to
   mimic human thought processes, learning capacity, and knowledge storage.
   AI techniques have been applied in cardiovascular medicine to explore
   novel genotypes and phenotypes in existing diseases, improve the quality
   of patient care, enable cost-effectiveness, and reduce readmission and
   mortality rates. Over the past decade, several machine-learning
   techniques have been used for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and
   prediction. Each problem requires some degree of understanding of the
   problem, in terms of cardiovascular medicine and statistics, to apply
   the optimal machine-learning algorithm. In the near future, AI will
   result in a paradigm shift toward precision cardiovascular medicine. The
   potential of AI in cardiovascular medicine is tremendous; however,
   ignorance of the challenges may overshadow its potential clinical
   impact. This paper gives a glimpse of AI's application in cardiovascular
   clinical care and discusses its potential role in facilitating precision

Abstract = {This paper provides the reflections of an educator regarding the
   pedagogical use of generative artificial intelligence and the need for
   students to develop artificial intelligence literacy. It starts by
   providing an overview of generative artificial intelligence and the
   controversy that surrounds the technology in the contemporary higher
   education context. This is followed by an argument highlighting that the
   controversy in the field ignores the pedagogical applications of
   generative artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates an
   example of how generative artificial intelligence has been used as part
   of a teaching strategy to help research students develop their
   artificial intelligence literacy. The paper argues that explicit
   modelling by educators can help students develop an understanding of
   generative artificial intelligence as a tool to improve their learning.},

Abstract = {The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in a smart society,
   in which the analysis of human habits is mandatory, requires automated
   data scheduling and analysis using smart applications, a smart
   infrastructure, smart systems, and a smart network. In this context,
   which is characterized by a large gap between training and operative
   processes, a dedicated method is required to manage and extract the
   massive amount of data and the related information mining. The method
   presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure
   advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in
   any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all
   management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also
   developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system
   to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for
   reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for
   creating a human-machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The
   results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible
   global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of
   a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade
   itself. Our new method provides guidance for selecting the new
   generation of intelligent manufacturing and smart systems in order to
   optimize human-machine interactions, with the related smart maintenance
   and education. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf

Abstract = {The main goal of this research is to improve the personification of
   learning in higher education. The proposed flexible model for organizing
   blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation
   of an individual learning path through testing students before the start
   of training. Based on the learning outcomes, the student is credited to
   the learning path. The training path consists of mandatory and
   additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after
   successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper
   examines the composition of intelligent learning systems: student model,
   learning model and interface model. A student model is described, which
   contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability
   to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use
   the information received or not), personal characteristics (type,
   orientation) and other factors. The student's model is described by a
   mathematical formula. Thus, being described using logical rules, which
   have formed the basis for the software implementation of mixed and
   distance learning rules for lifelong learning courses. There is an
   interface model presented in the paper, and the results of the course of
   the proposed flexible model for the organization of mixed and distance
   learning ``Digital Skills of a Modern Teacher in the Context of Distance
   Learning{''}, as well as the face-to-face course ``Digital Learning for
   Everyone{''} before the start of the pandemic which is close in its
   content to the course under study. Based on the results of the analysis,
   we introduced criteria for the effectiveness of the training course,
   proposed the weighting coefficients for evaluating the training course,
   carried out the assessment and drew conclusions.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence in Steam Cracking Modeling: A Deep Learning
   Algorithm for Detailed Effluent Prediction},
Journal = {ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1027-1040},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Chemical processes can benefit tremendously from fast and accurate
   effluent composition prediction for plant design, control, and
   optimization. The Industry 4.0 revolution claims that by introducing
   machine learning into these fields, substantial economic and
   environmental gains can be achieved. The bottleneck for high-frequency
   optimization and process control is often the time necessary to perform
   the required detailed analyses of, for example, feed and product. To
   resolve these issues, a framework of four deep learning artificial
   neural networks (DL ANNs) has been developed for the largest chemicals
   production process-steam cracking. The proposed methodology allows both
   a detailed characterization of a naphtha feedstock and a detailed
   composition of the steam cracker effluent to be determined, based on a
   limited number of commercial naphtha indices and rapidly accessible
   process characteristics. The detailed characterization of a naphtha is
   predicted from three points on the boiling curve and paraffins,
   iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aronatics (PIONA)
   characterization. If unavailable, the boiling points are also estimated.
   Even with estimated boiling points, the developed DL ANN outperforms
   several established methods such as maximization of Shannon entropy and
   traditional ANNs. For feedstock reconstruction, a mean absolute error
   (MAE) of 0.3 wt\% is achieved on the test set, while the MAE of the
   effluent prediction is 0.1 wt\%. When combining all networks-using the
   output of the previous as input to the next-the effluent MAE increases
   to 0.19 wt\%. In addition to the high accuracy of the networks, a major
   benefit is the negligible computational cost required to obtain the
   predictions. On a standard Intel i7 processor, predictions are made in
   the order of milliseconds. Commercial software such as COILSIM1D
   performs slightly better in terms of accuracy, but the required central
   processing unit time per reaction is in the order of seconds. This
   tremendous speed-up and minimal accuracy loss make the presented
   framework highly suitable for the continuous monitoring of
   difficult-to-access process parameters and for the envisioned,
   high-frequency real-time optimization (RTO) strategy or process control.
   Nevertheless, the lack of a fundamental basis implies that fundamental
   understanding is almost completely lost, which is not always
   well-accepted by the engineering community. In addition, the performance
   of the developed networks drops significantly for naphthas that are
   highly dissimilar to those in the training set. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large-scale
   global epidemic, impacting international politics and the economy. At
   present, there is no particularly effective medicine and treatment plan.
   Therefore, it is urgent and significant to find new technologies to
   diagnose early, isolate early, and treat early. Multimodal data drove
   artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially be the option. During the
   COVID-19 Pandemic, AI provided cutting-edge applications in disease,
   medicine, treatment, and target recognition. This paper reviewed the
   literature on the intersection of AI and medicine to analyze and compare
   different AI model applications in the COVID-19 Pandemic, evaluate their
   effectiveness, show their advantages and differences, and introduce the
   main models and their characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed,
   arXiv, medRxiv, and Google Scholar through February 2020 to identify
   studies on AI applications in the medical areas for the COVID-19
   Pandemic. Results: We summarize the main AI applications in six areas:
   (I) epidemiology, (II) diagnosis, (III) progression, (IV) treatment, (V)
   psychological health impact, and (VI) data security. The ongoing
   development in AI has significantly improved prediction, contact
   tracing, screening, diagnosis, treatment, medication, and vaccine
   development for the COVID-19 Pandemic and reducing human intervention in
   medical practice. Discussion: This paper provides strong advice for
   using AI-based auxiliary tools for related applications of human
   diseases. We also discuss the clinicians' role in the further
   development of AI. They and AI researchers can integrate AI technology
   with current clinical processes and information systems into
   applications. In the future, AI personnel and medical workers will
   further cooperate closely.},

Abstract = {Purpose Computational approaches have been used at different stages of
   drug development with the purpose of decreasing the time and cost of
   conventional experimental procedures. Lately, techniques mainly
   developed and applied in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), have
   been transferred to different application domains such as biomedicine.
   Methods In this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via
   data-driven evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   therapeutics in the context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing.
   First, we discussed basic concepts, computational approaches, databases,
   modeling approaches, and featurization techniques in drug
   discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we automatically integrated
   HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, pathways,
   phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar
   implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a
   knowledge graph using the CROssBAR system. Results Following the
   system-level evaluation and selection of critical genes/proteins and
   pathways to target, our deep learning-based drug/compound-target protein
   interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have been employed for
   predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these critical targets.
   Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated proteins which
   had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D space
   to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug
   candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.
   Conclusions We expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be
   used as a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from
   database-scale sets of compounds) to both HCC and other complex
   diseases, which may subsequently be analyzed with more targeted in
   silico and experimental approaches.},

Abstract = {Modeling suspended sediment load is a critical element of water
   resources engineering. In this work, using the ANFIS method, everyday
   suspended sediment particles were estimated in different categories of
   the river in US Sediment big data, and various flow rates were utilized
   for testing and training. The artificial intelligent (AI) method called
   ANFIS is used to train actual data from the river and provide an AI
   model with artificial data points. This artificial data point can show
   the occurrence of disaster for a critical day with different flow rates.
   The changing parameter in the AI model enables us to make a correct
   decision about critical time for rivers. This study also concentrates on
   the sensitivity investigation of ANFIS setting parameters on the
   accurateness of numerical results in order to find the best ANFIS model
   for rapid oscillation in the data set. The best performance of the ANFIS
   method is achieved with the trimf membership function, the number of
   input membership function = 16, and the number of iteration = 1000. The
   results also showed that the ANFIS model can provide fast computational
   calculation, and adding more nodes for the prediction cannot change the
   overall time of calculation due to the meshless behavior of the model.
   In addition to this model, we used the ant colony method for training of
   data set, and we found that the ANFIS method is better in learning and
   prediction of the dataset.},

Title = {Application of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Operating Mode of
   Professors' Academic Governance in American Research Universities},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence technology is an important transformative force
   for teaching innovation in the intelligent era. It is being widely used
   in American school teaching, including the design of intelligent
   tutoring systems to achieve precise problem solving, the machine
   learning technology to ensure personalized activity design, the creation
   of intelligent virtual reality to promote classroom teaching
   contextualization, and the development of intelligent evaluation systems
   to ensure the scientific evaluation of capabilities. In the process of
   advancing the teaching and application of artificial intelligence
   technology, the United States has built a linkage mechanism of federal
   leadership, university follow-up, and social collaboration and
   implemented the smart technology in school teaching and professors'
   academic governance. This paper is aimed at studying the professors'
   academic governance of American research universities by Internet data
   mining, historical analysis method, documentary method, survey method,
   and other methods. Professors' academic governance is a vital part of
   the modern university system that causes the institutional reform of the
   internal governance structure of modern universities. The United States
   is a powerful country in higher education, and professors in American
   research universities have always participated in university academic
   governance for centuries. By studying the definition, history, and
   development and mode of operation of professors' academic governance in
   American research universities, the results indicate a clear division of
   power and responsibility between the professors and administrators based
   on an artificial intelligence decision system in American research
   universities. Also, there is a good communication platform based on
   artificial intelligence environment for professors to discuss their
   opinions on academic affairs. Third, professors exercise academic power
   under the guarantee of diversified guaranteed systems based on the
   artificial intelligence evaluation system and the ideology of mutual
   respect based on the artificial intelligence management and service
   system. Studying the application of artificial intelligence techniques
   in operating mode and enlightenment of professors' academic governance
   in an American research university is of great significance to promote
   the construction of other modern universities' professors' academic
   governance system.},

   artificial intelligence: A cross-disciplinary framework and a research
   agenda},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 17},
Abstract = {Advancements in artificial intelligence are rapidly increasing. The
   new-generation large language models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, bear
   the potential to transform educational approaches, such as
   peer-feedback. To investigate peer-feedback at the intersection of
   natural language processing (NLP) and educational research, this paper
   suggests a cross-disciplinary framework that aims to facilitate the
   development of NLP-based adaptive measures for supporting peer-feedback
   processes in digital learning environments. To conceptualize this
   process, we introduce a peer-feedback process model, which describes
   learners' activities and textual products. Further, we introduce a
   terminological and procedural scheme that facilitates systematically
   deriving measures to foster the peer-feedback process and how NLP may
   enhance the adaptivity of such learning support. Building on prior
   research on education and NLP, we apply this scheme to all learner
   activities of the peer-feedback process model to exemplify a range of
   NLP-based adaptive support measures. We also discuss the current
   challenges and suggest directions for future cross-disciplinary research
   on the effectiveness and other dimensions of NLP-based adaptive support
   for peer-feedback. Building on our suggested framework, future research
   and collaborations at the intersection of education and NLP can innovate
   peer-feedback in digital learning environments.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To offer practical guidance to nurse investigators
   interested in multidisciplinary research that includes assisting in the
   development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for ``smart{''}
   health management and aging-in-place.
   Methods: Ten health-assistive Smart Homes were deployed to chronically
   ill older adults from 2015 to 2018. Data were collected using five
   sensor types (infrared motion, contact, light, temperature, and
   humidity). Nurses used telehealth and home visitation to collect health
   data and provide ground truth annotation for training intelligent
   algorithms using raw sensor data containing health events.
   Findings: Nurses assisting with the development of health-assistive AI
   may encounter unique challenges and opportunities. We recommend: (a)
   using a practical and consistent method for collecting field data, (b)
   using nurse-driven measures for data analytics, (c) multidisciplinary
   communication occur on an engineering-preferred platform.
   Conclusions: Practical frameworks to guide nurse investigators
   integrating clinical data with sensor data for training machine learning
   algorithms may build capacity for nurses to make significant
   contributions to developing AI for health-assistive Smart Homes.},

Title = {Research on the experimental principle of deep integration of LETS
   software and criminal procedure under the background of artificial
   intelligence},
Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES},

Abstract = {The teaching of law courses in Legal Experimental Teaching System (LETS)
   enables students to have a clearer understanding of the litigation
   process, master the format and production of various criminal litigation
   legal documents and train their communication and collaboration skills
   in litigation by cooperating to complete the experimental process.
   However, there are some shortcomings in experimental teaching using the
   LETS system, such as teachers being unable give real-time guidance and
   unable to reflect the principle of direct speech in litigation. Given
   these problems, this paper proposes a framework for the deep integration
   of LETS software and criminal litigation under the background of
   artificial intelligence (AI). First, it introduces the current situation
   and development of criminal litigation under the background of AI. Then,
   a set of AI parameters is designed based on the background of LETS
   software and criminal proceedings deep integration framework, and at the
   same time, the framework is used for intelligent learning criminal
   proceedings. The experimental results show that LETS software can better
   match the algorithm of the AI environment to push personalised criminal
   procedure learning courses. The experiment also shows that this
   framework can provide new ideas and development for the future study of
   criminal procedure.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Assisted System in Postoperative Follow-up of
   Orthopedic Patients: Exploratory Quantitative and Qualitative Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Background: Patient follow-up is an essential part of hospital ward
   management. With the development of deep learning algorithms, individual
   follow-up assignments might be completed by artificial intelligence
   (AI). We developed an AI-assisted follow-up conversational agent that
   can simulate the human voice and select an appropriate follow-up time
   for quantitative, automatic, and personalized patient follow-up. Patient
   feedback and voice information could be collected and converted into
   text data automatically.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the
   cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up to manual follow-up of
   patients after surgery. The secondary objective was to compare the
   feedback from AI-assisted follow-up to feedback from manual follow-up.
   Methods: The AI-assisted follow-up system was adopted in the Orthopedic
   Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in April 2019. A
   total of 270 patients were followed up through this system. Prior to
   that, 2656 patients were followed up by phone calls manually Patient
   characteristics, telephone connection rate, follow-up rate, feedback
   collection rate, time spent, and feedback composition were compared
   between the two groups of patients.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference in age,
   gender, or disease between the two groups. There was no significant
   difference in telephone connection rate (manual . 2478/2656, 93.3\%;
   AI-assisted: 249/270, 92.2\%; P=.50) or successful follow-up rate
   (manual: 2301/2478, 92.9\%; AI-assisted: 231/249, 92.8\%; P=.96) between
   the two groups. The time spent on 100 patients in the manual follow-up
   group was about 9.3 hours. In contrast, the time spent on the
   AI-assisted follow-up was close to 0 hours. The feedback rate in the
   AI-assisted follow-up group was higher than that in the manual follow-up
   group (manual: 68/2656, 2.5\%; AI-assisted: 28/270, 10.3\%; P<.001). The
   composition of feedback was different in the two groups. Feedback from
   the AI-assisted follow-up group mainly included nursing, health
   education, and hospital environment content, while feedback from the
   manual follow-up group mostly included medical consultation content.
   Conclusions: The effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up was not inferior
   to that of manual follow-up. Human resource costs are saved by AI. AI
   can help obtain comprehensive feedback from patients, although its depth
   and pertinence of communication need to be improved.},

Abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with acute
   intense respiratory syndrome which spread around the world for the very
   first time impacting the way of life with drastic uncertainty. It
   rapidly reached almost every nook and corner of the world and the World
   Health Organization (WHO) has announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. The
   health care institutions around the globe are looking for viable and
   real-time technological solutions to handle the virus for evading its
   spread and circumvent probable demises. Importantly, the artificial
   intelligence tools and techniques are playing a major role in fighting
   the effect of virus on the economic jolt by mimicking human intelligence
   by screening, analyzing, predicting and tracking the existing and likely
   future patients. Since the first reported case, all the government
   organizations in the world jumped into action to prevent it and many
   studies reported the role of AI in taking decisions analyzing big data
   available in public sphere. Thereby, this review focuses on identifying
   the significant implication of AI techniques used for the COVID-19
   disease management in the public sphere by agglomerating the latest
   available information. It also discusses the pitfalls and future

Abstract = {The combination of education and artificial intelligence is the
   developmental direction of future educational systems. Through the
   participation of artificial intelligence, an educational system with
   sensibility and computer rationality can be created. Albeit the
   advantages and importance of this education system are beyond doubt,
   nevertheless, at present, the combination of artificial intelligence and
   education is still in its infancy. This is because the theoretical
   application, equipment research, and development are neither perfect nor
   up to the required standard. The research points out the reality that
   artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in sports and
   analyzes the specific application of artificial intelligence in sports.
   In this paper, the knowledge of artificial intelligence is combined with
   the physical training and teaching in colleges and universities, and an
   educational system is developed to guide teachers' and students'

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to establish whether an
   artificially intelligent (AI) system can be developed to automate stress
   echocardiography analysis and support clinician
   interpretation.BACKGROUND Coronary artery disease is the leading global
   cause of mortality and morbidity and stress echocardi-ography remains
   one of the most commonly used diagnostic imaging tests.METHODS An
   automated image processing pipeline was developed to extract novel
   geometric and kinematic features from stress echocardiograms collected
   as part of a large, United Kingdom-based prospective, multicenter,
   multivendor study. An ensemble machine learning classifier was trained,
   using the extracted features, to identify patients with severe coronary
   artery disease on invasive coronary angiography. The model was tested in
   an independent U.S. study. How availability of an AI classification
   might impact clinical interpretation of stress echocardiograms was
   evaluated in a randomized crossover reader study.RESULTS Acceptable
   classification accuracy for identification of patients with severe
   coronary artery disease in the training data set was achieved on
   cross-fold validation based on 31 unique geometric and kinematic
   features, with a specificity of 92.7\% and a sensitivity of 84.4\%. This
   accuracy was maintained in the independent validation data set. The use
   of the AI classification tool by clinicians increased inter-reader
   agreement and confidence as well as sensitivity for detection of disease
   by 10\% to achieve an area under the receiver-operating characteristic
   curve of 0.93.CONCLUSIONS Automated analysis of stress echocardiograms
   is possible using AI and provision of automated clas-sifications to
   clinicians when reading stress echocardiograms could improve accuracy,
   inter-reader agreement, and reader confidence. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img

Abstract = {Using the traditional English teaching mode is difficult to help correct
   students, and it is difficult to achieve human-computer interaction in
   oral English communication. In order to improve the effect of English
   detection and improve teaching efficiency, this article builds an
   artificial intelligence-assisted teaching system suitable for English
   teaching based on heuristic genetic algorithms. Furthermore, this
   article extends the multioffspring genetic algorithm, improves the
   offspring generation method, and proposes GMOGA, which makes the choice
   of the number of offspring more flexible. At the same time, it also
   enables the value of the number of children of the algorithm to be a
   value that cannot be obtained by the previous algorithm, which further
   improves the efficiency of the algorithm. In addition, this article
   combines the actual needs to construct the functional structure of the
   artificial intelligence system and designs two sets of comparative
   experiments to verify and analyze the model's performance. The research
   results show that the model constructed in this article meets the
   multifunctional requirements of the system and can be applied to

Abstract = {Statement of problem. Artificial intelligence applications are
   increasing in prosthodontics. Still, the current development and
   performance of artificial intelligence in prosthodontic applications has
   not yet been systematically documented and analyzed. Purpose. The
   purpose of this systematic review was to assess the performance of the
   artificial intelligence models in prosthodontics for tooth shade
   selection, automation of restoration design, mapping the tooth
   preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting,
   predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and
   designing removable partial dentures. Material and methods. An
   electronic systematic review was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE,
   Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also
   conducted. Studies with artificial intelligence models were selected
   based on 6 criteria: tooth shade selection, automated fabrication of
   dental restorations, mapping the finishing line of tooth preparations,
   optimizing the manufacturing casting process, predicting facial changes
   in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial
   dentures. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality
   assessment of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute
   Critical Appraisal Checklist for QuasiExperimental Studies
   (nonrandomized experimental studies). A third investigator was consulted
   to resolve lack of consensus. Results. A total of 36 articles were
   reviewed and classified into 6 groups based on the application of the
   artificial intelligence model. One article reported on the development
   of an artificial intelligence model for tooth shade selection, reporting
   better shade matching than with conventional visual selection; 14
   articles reported on the feasibility of automated design of dental
   restorations using different artificial intelligence models; 1
   artificial intelligence model was able to mark the margin line without
   manual interaction with an average accuracy ranging from 90.6\% to
   97.4\%; 2 investigations developed artificial intelligence algorithms
   for optimizing the manufacturing casting process, reporting an
   improvement of the design process, minimizing the porosity on the cast
   metal, and reducing the overall manufacturing time; 1 study proposed an
   artificial intelligence model that was able to predict facial changes in
   patients using removable prostheses; and 17 investigations that
   developed clinical decision support, expert systems for designing
   removable partial dentures for clinicians and educational purposes,
   computer-aided learning with video interactive programs for student
   learning, and automated removable partial denture design. Conclusions.
   Artificial intelligence models have shown the potential for providing a
   reliable diagnostic tool for tooth shade selection, automated
   restoration design, mapping the preparation finishing line, optimizing
   the manufacturing casting, predicting facial changes in patients with
   removable prostheses, and designing removable partial dentures, but they
   are still in development. Additional studies are needed to further
   develop and assess their clinical performance. (J Prosthet Dent

Pages = {615-622},
Abstract = {Natural language processing (NLP) has been studied in computing for
   decades. Recent technological advancements have led to the development
   of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as Chat
   Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT). These models can perform a
   range of language tasks and generate human-like responses, which offers
   exciting prospects for academic efficiency. This manuscript aims at (i)
   exploring the potential benefits and threats of ChatGPT and other NLP
   technologies in academic writing and research publications; (ii)
   highlights the ethical considerations involved in using these tools, and
   (iii) consider the impact they may have on the authenticity and
   credibility of academic work. This study involved a literature review of
   relevant scholarly articles published in peer-reviewed journals indexed
   in Scopus as quartile 1. The search used keywords such as ``ChatGPT,{''}
   ``AI-generated text,{''} ``academic writing,{''} and ``natural language
   processing.{''} The analysis was carried out using a quasi-qualitative
   approach, which involved reading and critically evaluating the sources
   and identifying relevant data to support the research questions. The
   study found that ChatGPT and other NLP technologies have the potential
   to enhance academic writing and research efficiency. However, their use
   also raises concerns about the impact on the authenticity and
   credibility of academic work. The study highlights the need for
   comprehensive discussions on the potential use, threats, and limitations
   of these tools, emphasizing the importance of ethical and academic
   principles, with human intelligence and critical thinking at the
   forefront of the research process. This study highlights the need for
   comprehensive debates and ethical considerations involved in their use.
   The study also recommends that academics exercise caution when using
   these tools and ensure transparency in their use, emphasizing the
   importance of human intelligence and critical thinking in academic work.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for integrating AI and philosophy
   of the mind in the K-12 classroom. Our rationale for this approach
   includes its capability to promote discourse and frame learning and the
   need to take a more holistic approach to engineering. We hare dei,eloped
   a curriculam unit based, upon the integrated approach that includes
   intended learning outcomes, a concept map and two example activities for
   the classroom. We present this curriculum unit together with the
   preconception's of middle and high school students related to the
   concepts in the unit. The collected data shows high levels of interest
   in the possibilities of thinking machines, but only a naive
   understanding of the issues. Some gender differences are also indicated.
   Finally we present two applications where the curriculum was used in the
   classroom. The first is a one-week unit in a middle school language
   at-is classroom and the second is a full-year project-based high school
   course. Results from both settings showed high levels of engagement and
   were consistent with student achievement of intended learning outcomes.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence Aerobics Action Image Simulation Based on the
   Image Segmentation Algorithm},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {At present, aerobics is becoming a popular fashion with the continuous
   development of cultural needs. Because aerobics has the characteristics
   of many movements, rapid changes, strong complexity, and difficult
   performance of difficult movements, the current aerobics teaching still
   presents shortcomings such as low teaching level, limited teachers'
   resources, and energy. Therefore, it is difficult to effectively meet
   the actual learning needs of students. Based on this point, artificial
   intelligence can be used to simulate and guide the technical movements
   of aerobics to effectively teach students. In this paper, an artificial
   intelligence aerobics image simulation system is researched and
   developed and the GrabCut image segmentation algorithm is mainly used.
   After analyzing some shortcomings of the algorithm, the GrabCut
   algorithm cascade and graph-based are selected to complete the
   optimization, so as to lay a good system foundation and then build the
   aerobics artificial intelligence image simulation system according to
   the algorithm foundation. Finally, it analyzes and researches the actual
   problems of aerobics teaching activities in colleges and universities
   and focuses on the problems, achievements, and personal satisfaction of
   students who use the system in actual learning, which proves that the
   system can effectively assist aerobics teaching activities. By studying
   the image segmentation algorithm and artificial intelligence technology,
   this paper applies it to the field of aerobics action image simulation,
   so as to promote its technological development.},

Abstract = {Consequential historical decisions that shaped transportation systems
   and their influence on society have many valuable lessons. The decisions
   we learn from and choose to make going forward will play a key role in
   shaping the mobility landscape of the future. This is especially
   pertinent as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in the
   form of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Throughout urban history, there have
   been cyclical transport oppressions of previous-generation
   transportation methods to make way for novel transport methods. These
   cyclical oppressions can be identified in the baroque and modernist
   periods, and a third oppression may occur in the contemporary period. To
   explore the idea of a third oppression, we focus on the bicycle and
   outline the history of cycling to understand how historical mode
   oppression unfolded. We then present several social and political
   factors that contributed to the oppression of cycling and share
   recommendations for how to avoid future oppressions including political,
   social, and design actions for researchers and policymakers to take.
   This paper argues that priorities for AI-enabled mobility and cyclist
   needs be advanced in proportion to the extent that they contribute to
   societal goals of urban containment, public realm, and proximal cities.
   Additionally, future mobility evolutions should prioritise mobility
   justice and mode choice over inducing a singular transportation method.},

Month = {SEP 24},
Abstract = {Strengthening construction for teaching staff is an eternal theme of
   development and construction for colleges, and it is also the focus of
   personnel management in colleges. China is swiftly transitioning from
   the industrial age to the era of intelligence as a result of the rapid
   growth of information technology and artificial intelligence. Colleges
   and universities have reached a new stage in their evolution, one marked
   by intelligent use of technology, as represented by the fourth
   generation of information technology: cloud computing, big data, and
   artificial intelligence. Higher standards for college professors'
   teaching abilities have been imposed by this new policy. It is therefore
   beneficial to evaluate teachers' teaching abilities from an artificial
   intelligence perspective to improve the overall quality of college
   education. First, this work researches and improves the teaching ability
   training strategies of college teachers driven by artificial
   intelligence from different levels. Second, this work proposes a neural
   network (IPSO-BP) for evaluating the teaching ability of college
   teachers via artificial intelligence technology. Aiming at the issues in
   BP network, this work constructs IPSO by improving the weight decay
   strategy and learning factor of PSO algorithm. Then, it uses IPSO to
   optimize the BP to construct IPSO-BP. Third, the results of the
   experiments in this work suggest that the strategy proposed here is both
   feasible and preferable.},

   development and growth of recommender systems in higher education. Two
   hundred seventy-two (272) articles published between 2007 and 2021 in
   the Scopus database were utilized to collect data. The study examines
   the different patterns such as publication trends, the relative growth
   rate (RGR) and doubling time (DT) for publications. Results show a
   steady increase in publications, with 2017 recording the highest number
   of publications. China, Spain and the United States have the highest
   publications. The mean RGR decreased, and the mean doubling time
   increased in the three-five-year periods. The study identified sixteen
   themes covered by the research articles analyzed. Most articles focused
   on e-learning, followed by classroom activities and, thirdly, those
   focusing on course selection. The study provides essential insights into
   current and future research on recommender systems in higher education.

Title = {An Oral English Evaluation Model Using Artificial Intelligence Method},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that oral English classes have been available since
   primary school, most students' oral English skills are poor and they
   struggle to communicate in simple everyday situations. This new
   requirement has been proposed in light of the general lack of English
   listening and speaking skills among Chinese college students. The
   current manual test for CET-4 and CET-6 will be gradually replaced by a
   computer test, and the CET-6 computer test will be included in the
   ``quality engineering{''} project of national university teaching. The
   natural integration of artificial intelligence and education is
   assisting in the transformation of the traditional education ecology.
   Mind mapping has also had a significant impact on the education
   industry, and it has significant value in current educational
   applications. In order to truly realize personalized learning, we should
   pay more attention to the educational noumenon that the status of
   educators and learners has changed in education, that is, the
   transformation from educators to learners' development. Artificial
   intelligence technology can be used effectively by junior high school
   English teachers to conduct oral English evaluation activities, which
   can more accurately judge students' oral English expression ability and
   serve as a useful tool for adjusting and improving students' learning
   methods.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has inspired new
   innovations in diagnosing, treating, and dispositioning patients during
   high census conditions with constrained resources. Our objective is to
   describe first experiences of physician interaction with a novel
   artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to enhance physician
   abilities to identify ground-glass opacities and consolidation on chest
   radiographs.
   MethodsDuring the first wave of the pandemic, we deployed a previously
   developed and validated deep-learning AI algorithm for assisted
   interpretation of chest radiographs for use by physicians at an academic
   health system in Southern California. The algorithm overlays radiographs
   with ``heat{''} maps that indicate pneumonia probability alongside
   standard chest radiographs at the point of care. Physicians were
   surveyed in real time regarding ease of use and impact on clinical
   decisionmaking.
   ResultsOf the 5125 total visits and 1960 chest radiographs obtained in
   the emergency department (ED) during the study period, 1855 were
   analyzed by the algorithm. Among these, emergency physicians were
   surveyed for their experiences on 202 radiographs. Overall, 86\% either
   strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the intervention was easy to use
   in their workflow. Of the respondents, 20\% reported that the algorithm
   impacted clinical decisionmaking.
   ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first published literature
   evaluating the impact of medical imaging AI on clinical decisionmaking
   in the emergency department setting. Urgent deployment of a previously
   validated AI algorithm clinically was easy to use and was found to have
   an impact on clinical decision making during the predicted surge period
   of a global pandemic.},

Title = {The Optimization of Civic Education with the Assistance of Artificial
   Intelligence Devices},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 21},
Abstract = {With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, a technological
   revolution has begun in the field of education, which has injected new
   momentum into moral education. Today, civic education is developing
   rapidly in countries around the world, while civic education in China is
   still relatively lagging behind. In China, we need to optimize civic
   education by building a comprehensive civic education system,
   implementing the concept of people-oriented, gathering the joint efforts
   of the whole society, expanding diversified civic education methods, and
   selecting and enriching the contents of civic education. Artificial
   intelligence technology enables higher education institutions to carry
   out civic education, enrich teaching contents, broaden teaching methods,
   and optimize teaching evaluation. However, technology-related
   innovations are dualistic in nature, with essential, technical, and
   value risks that hinder their effectiveness in civic education. This
   paper proposes strategies for optimization in terms of improving digital
   core risk response capabilities, establishing reliable technology risk
   response mechanisms, and maintaining a foundation for civic education
   response costs. Thus, weakening the risk factors of AI in civic
   education facilitates the transformation of AI and technology to the
   advantage of knowledge-based civic education. This paper discusses
   strategies and methods for optimizing smart education using AI devices
   and establishes a corresponding smart education platform to help
   students with their ideological education. Based on the analysis of
   actual cases, the paper discusses the effectiveness and advantages of
   the program.},

Abstract = {The role of higher education in social and spatial mobility has
   attracted considerable attention. However, there are very few
   countrywide databases that follow the career paths of graduates from
   their place of birth, through their enrollment in university, and
   ultimately to their workplace. However, in Hungary, there is an
   excellent source maintained by the government's Education Authority
   containing information on career tracks, which allows one to follow all
   students from their place of birth, through their choice of higher
   education institution, to their workplace. With the combination of
   gravity-like economic models and the proposed mobility network, this
   paper examines the mediating and retaining role of institutions. This
   paper also proposes how to calculate the added value of location and
   institution in salaries and how to use these values to explain mobility
   between locations. The paper also shows how economic inequities
   influence revealed application preferences through the asymmetry of the
   mobility network.},

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 10},
Abstract = {The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought great
   convenience to people and has been widely used in the field of
   education. To monitor the classroom status of college students in real
   time and achieve the purpose of balanced distribution of educational
   resources, the facial expression recognition (FER) algorithm is applied
   to the management of higher education in universities. Firstly, the
   convolutional neural network (CNN) is studied in depth, and secondly,
   the process and method of FER are explored in detail, and an adaptive
   FER algorithm based on the diSerential convolutional neural network
   (DCNN) is constructed. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the CK+
   database and the BU-4DFE database. The results manifest that the
   designed algorithm has an accuracy of 99.02\% for keyframe detection in
   the CK+ database and 98.35\% for the BU-4DFE database. The algorithm has
   a high accuracy of keyframe detection for both expression databases. It
   has a good eSect on the automatic detection of keyframes of expression
   sequences and can reach a level similar to that of manual frame
   selection. Compared with the existing algorithms, the proposed method
   still has higher advantages. It can eSectively eliminate the
   interference of individual diSerences and environmental noise on FER.
   Experiments reveal that the proposed FER algorithm DCNN-based has a good
   recognition eSect and is suitable for monitoring students' classroom
   status. This research has certain reference significance for the
   application of AI in higher education management in colleges and
   universities.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND Classic risk assessment tools often treat patients' risk
   factors as linear and additive. Clinical reality suggests that the
   presence of certain risk factors can alter the impact of other factors;
   in other words, risk modeling is not linear. We aimed to use artificial
   intelligence (AI) technology to design and validate a nonlinear risk
   calculator for trauma patients. METHODS A novel, interpretable AI
   technology called Optimal Classification Trees (OCTs) was used in an
   80:20 derivation/validation split of the 2010 to 2016 American College
   of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics,
   emergency department vital signs, comorbidities, and injury
   characteristics (e.g., severity, mechanism) of all blunt and penetrating
   trauma patients 18 years or older were used to develop, train then
   validate OCT algorithms to predict in-hospital mortality and
   complications (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress
   syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis). A
   smartphone application was created as the algorithm's interactive and
   user-friendly interface. Performance was measured using the c-statistic
   methodology. RESULTS A total of 934,053 patients were included (747,249
   derivation; 186,804 validation). The median age was 51 years, 37\% were
   women, 90.5\% had blunt trauma, and the median Injury Severity Score was
   11. Comprehensive OCT algorithms were developed for blunt and
   penetrating trauma, and the interactive smartphone application, Trauma
   Outcome Predictor (TOP) was created, where the answer to one question
   unfolds the subsequent one. Trauma Outcome Predictor accurately
   predicted mortality in penetrating injury (c-statistics: 0.95
   derivation, 0.94 validation) and blunt injury (c-statistics: 0.89
   derivation, 0.88 validation). The validation c-statistics for predicting
   complications ranged between 0.69 and 0.84. CONCLUSION We suggest TOP as
   an AI-based, interpretable, accurate, and nonlinear risk calculator for
   predicting outcome in trauma patients. Trauma Outcome Predictor can
   prove useful for bedside counseling of critically injured trauma
   patients and their families, and for benchmarking the quality of trauma
   care.},

Abstract = {On the basis of the analysis of queries in Google Trends, Google
   Scholar, and the database of Volodymyr Vernadskyi National Library of
   Ukraine, a sample of historically structured knowledge systems has been
   obtained which can be used to describe the contribution of distance
   learning studies during the time slots available for each resource.
   According to the survey of students of four institutions of different
   education types (classical, technological, pedagogical and marine ones),
   the modern state-of-the-art of the application of distance learning
   technologies at higher education institutions is established. The
   analysis of the progressive ideas and practical achievements of
   countries of Europe, North America and Asia, which in recent years have
   made the significant progress in reforming their educational systems and
   the implementation of innovative technologies, has allowed to
   distinguish the following technological advances for the implementation
   of distance learning technologies: the adaptive learning technology,
   mobile learning, the virtual, supplemented and hybrid reality, the
   Internet of Things, systems of the next generation learning management,
   artificial intelligence and natural user interfaces. The following
   perspectives of the distance learning development in Ukraine are
   highlighted: updating of software and technical support and material
   resources of higher education institutions; provision of higher
   education institutions of Ukraine with the broadband Internet access;
   organization of cooperation of software developers for distance
   learning, distance education methodologists and lecturer; improvement
   the staffing of distance learning; development and distribution of
   platforms with intuitive non-complex software interfaces for creating
   distance courses; creation or adaptation of information technologies and
   electronic educational and methodological developments for the support
   of new technologies of distance learning at higher education
   institutions of Ukraine; studying the effectiveness of technological
   advances in the IT industry in the process of higher education teaching
   and learning, ensuring the process of obtaining an educational degree
   (bachelor's degree, master's degree) at higher education institutions of
   Ukraine through training at mass open distance courses.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a wearable assistive system based on artificial
   intelligence (AI) edge computing techniques to help visually impaired
   consumers safely use marked crosswalks, or zebra crossings. The proposed
   wearable assistive system consists of a pair of smart sunglasses, a
   waist-mounted intelligent device, and an intelligent walking cane
   (stick). A deep learning technique is adopted for zebra crossing image
   recognition in real time. Visually impaired consumers need to wear the
   proposed smart sunglasses and waist-mounted intelligent device and hold
   the proposed intelligent walking cane when they approach a zebra
   crossing. When a visually impaired pedestrian reaches a zebra crossing,
   they will immediately receive a message about the current situation at
   the crossing and the traffic light signal. Experimental results show
   that the accuracy of real-time zebra crossing recognition of the
   proposed system can reach up to 90\%.},

Title = {Innovation in Teaching Method Using Visual Communication under the
   Background of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {The iterative update of artificial intelligence (AI) is resulting in the
   development of new educational concepts, methodologies, and methods.
   Taking as a starting point, the contemporary visual communication design
   is largely influenced by artificial intelligence's techniques, design
   methods, and display methods. Moreover, combining the possibilities
   brought by artificial intelligence's characteristics to the teaching
   mode will be of great interest in teaching innovations. Similarly,
   integrating and deepening the innovation of teaching modes, and making
   artificial intelligence a teaching mode is more beneficial to teachers
   and student. Subsequently, this gives full play to the benefits in
   visual communication design and education in order to change and upgrade
   to intelligent visual communication design teaching techniques.
   Therefore, it is also crucial to investigate the use of visual
   communication design in the teaching process. This paper also offers
   while studying the innovation of visual communication design education
   techniques, a deep understanding of the AI technology and big data.
   Under the restrictions of visual communication, the virtual
   reconstruction approach of 3D images may effectively tackle the problem
   of an unstable pixel extraction process induced by pixel loss. Our
   empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method is superior to that
   of the other state-of-the-art techniques.},

Title = {PREDICTING THE MENTAL STRESS LEVEL OF DRIVERS IN A BRAKING CAR PROCESS
   USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Journal = {ACTA NEUROPSYCHOLOGICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-15},
Abstract = {Background: Reducing the physical and mental weariness of drivers is
   significant in improving healthy and safe driving. This paper is aim to
   predict the stress level of drivers while braking in various conditions
   of the track. By discovering the drivers' mental stress level, we are
   able to safely and comfortably adjust the distance in relation to the
   vehicle ahead.
   Material/Methods: The initial step used was a study related to
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), safe distance
   in braking, and the theory of mental stress. The data was collected by
   doing a direct measurement of drivers' stress levels using the EEG tool.
   The respondents were 5 parties around 30-50 years old who had experience
   in driving for > 5 years. The research asembled 400 pieces of data about
   braking including the data of the velocity before braking, track
   varieties (cityroad, rural road, residential road, and toll road),
   braking distance, stress level (EEG), and focus (EEG). The database
   constructed was used to input the machine learning (AI) - Back
   Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) in order to predict the drivers'
   mental stress level.
   Results: Referring to the data collection, each road type gave a
   different value of metal stress and focus. City road drivers used an
   average velocity of 23.24 Km/h with an average braking distance of 11.17
   m which generated an average stress level of 53.44 and a focus value of
   45.76.Under other conditions, city road drivers generated a 52.11 stress
   level, the rural road = 48.65, and 50.23 for the toll road. BPNN
   Training with 1 hidden layer, neuron = 17, ground transfer function,
   sigmoid linear, and optimation using Genetic Algorithm (GA) obtained the
   Mean Square Error (MSE) value = 0.00537. The road infrastructure,
   driving behavior, and emerging hazards in driving took part in
   increasing the stress level and concentration needs of the drivers.
   Conclusion: The conclusion may be drawn that the available data and the
   chosen BPNN structure were appropriate to be used in training and be
   utilized to predict drivers' focus and mental stress level. This AI
   module is beneficial in inputting the data to the braking car safety
   system by considering those mental factors completing the existing
   technical factor considerations.},

Title = {IoT-Based English Translation Teaching from the Perspective of
   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, the
   Internet of Things (IoT) has become a research hotspot in industry and
   academia. At the same time, as a derivative tool of artificial
   intelligence, machine translation based on the IoT is constantly being
   applied to English translation and its teaching. In teaching, helping
   students learn English translation has been the focus of machine
   translation in recent years. Compared with human translation, machine
   translation is more efficient and convenient. However, machine
   translation also has some problems. Compared with traditional human
   translation, it cannot meet the requirements of faithfulness,
   expressiveness, and elegance of translation. In many fields, neural
   network translation is comparable to human translation. In the field of
   English translation teaching, neural network translation has broad
   prospects. With the gradual maturity of neural network translation, we
   should think about how to use neural network translation to make it a
   powerful English translation teaching tool instead of sticking to
   traditional teaching and cultivating students who are completely unable
   to compare it with neural network translation. Therefore, in the context
   of rapid AI iteration, college English translation teaching should also
   keep pace with the times. With the help of tools such as neural network
   translation, English translation talents who can skillfully use AI
   technology can be trained quickly and efficiently so that they can keep
   pace with the times and master the power of AI. The research in this
   paper provides important guidance for the application of artificial
   intelligence and the Internet of Things, especially for intelligent
   relaying.},

Abstract = {Spatial layout planning in architecture requires a deep understanding of
   topological spatial relationships, yet the process remains repetitive
   and laborious for designers. However, advancements in artificial
   intelligence (AI) offer new perspectives through automated spatial
   layout planning (ASLP), diverging from traditional human-centered
   approaches. This paper employs quantitative and qualitative analyses,
   reviewing 589 journal articles from the past decade, to gain a
   comprehensive understanding of ASLP+AI. It also proposes future research
   directions, exploring image-based, graph-based, performance-based, and
   agent-based approaches. Contributions to the existing body of knowledge
   include advancing ASLP through AI methodologies while preserving
   architects as curators, with a broader impact on academia and industry

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aimed to determine the extent to which academic
   libraries and information services were extended due to the emergence of
   COVID-19 in the Gauteng Province, South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach Founded on a pragmatism paradigm, the
   sequential explanatory research design was adopted to engage with
   participants and respondents on their experience of library services
   extensions to support users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were
   collected using online questionnaires and interviews. Cluster and
   purposive sampling were used and data for the quantitative part were
   analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS),
   whilst qualitative data were analyzed manually. Findings Findings
   revealed that academic libraries operating in a higher education
   environment provided extensive support to remote users during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This was done through the utilization of a variety of
   technology utilization, ranging from traditional e-mail support to the
   use of technology related to Artificial Intelligence such as the BOTsa,
   which is a Chatbot aimed to assist users in receiving speedy responses
   to library-related inquiries. Originality/value This study is unique in
   that it focuses on academic libraries that operate in higher education
   environments where support for achieving academic endeavors becomes
   imperative to ensure the smooth execution of teaching and learning
   activities within the restrictions put in place due to the COVID-19
   pandemic. Adaptions and improvements to academic library services during
   and post-COVID-19 era were successful in ensuring that remote users
   could obtain similar services and access to information as was the case
   before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   life. Meanwhile, smart education appeared and attracted much attention;
   however, there is still a lack of systematic discussion on how to take
   the road of artificial intelligence plus smart classroom. In order to
   promote the intelligent development of education, this article mainly
   talks about the application of artificial intelligence technology to
   college English smart classrooms. In the process of teaching, a new
   teaching model of college English smart classroom was designed, and the
   teaching model was carried out through the experimental class and the
   survey results of the students. The survey results show that students'
   satisfaction with this teaching model is as high as 80\%.},

Abstract = {Hydrological models are valuable tools for developing streamflow
   predictions in unmonitored catchments to increase our understanding of
   hydrological processes. A recent effort has been made in the development
   of hybrid (conceptual/machine learning) models that can preserve some of
   the hydrological processes represented by conceptual models and can
   improve streamflow predictions. However, these studies have not explored
   how the data-driven component of hybrid models resolved runoff routing.
   In this study, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are
   used to turn a `black-box' model into a `glass box' model. The hybrid
   models reduced the root-mean-square error of the simulated streamflow
   values by approximately 27, 50, and 24\% for stations 17120000,
   27380000, and 33680000, respectively, relative to the traditional
   method. XAI techniques helped unveil the importance of accounting for
   soil moisture in hydrological models. Differing from purely data-driven
   hydrological models, the inclusion of the production storage in the
   proposed hybrid model, which is responsible for estimating the water
   balance, reduced the short- and long-term dependencies of input
   variables for streamflow prediction. In addition, soil moisture
   controlled water percolation, which was the main predictor of
   streamflow. This finding is because soil moisture controls the
   underlying mechanisms of groundwater flow into river streams.},

Abstract = {The ``New Era Artificial Brain Power Improvement Plan{''} issued by the
   State Council and the ``Computer Reasoning Development Activity Plan for
   Colleges and Universities{''} issued by the Ministry of Education
   clearly pointed out that it is necessary to attach importance to the
   combination of modern education and artificial intelligence. As a global
   language, English is becoming more and more important in global trade.
   Under the premise of educational plan changes in the new environment,
   English teaching is gradually reflected in the cultivation of college
   students' English application ability. This research studies the current
   college English audio-visual-oral teaching mode from the perspective of
   artificial intelligence and analyzes the current situation of
   traditional English teaching by explaining the meaning of artificial
   intelligence, which mainly includes four stages: literature research,
   model construction, empirical research, and result analysis. In light of
   BP neural network, the showing assessment model of school English
   audio-visual-oral is laid out, and the change technique of showing
   method of school English audio-visual-oral under AI is advanced.
   Experiments show that this model achieves better teaching quality than
   the models constructed by traditional GA algorithm and BSA algorithm and
   is more suitable for promotion in college English teaching.},

Title = {The diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence algorithms for

   review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {50},
Number = {4},
Pages = {449-454},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have been
   developed to facilitate rapid and accurate computed tomography
   angiography (CTA) assessment in proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO)
   acute ischemic stroke, including internal carotid artery and M1
   occlusions. In clinical practice, however, the detection of medium
   vessel occlusion (MeVO) represents an ongoing diagnostic challenge in
   which the added value of AI remains unclear. Purpose: To assess the
   diagnostic performance of AI platforms for detecting M2 occlusions.
   Methods: Studies that report the diagnostic performance of AI-based
   detection of M2 occlusions were screened, and sensitivity and
   specificity data were extracted using the semi-automated AutoLit
   software (Nested Knowledge, MN) platform. STATA (version 16 IC; Stata
   Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to conduct all
   analyses. Results: Eight studies with a low risk of bias and significant
   heterogeneity were included in the quantitative and qualitative
   synthesis. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of AI
   platforms for M2 occlusion detection were 64\% (95\% CI, 53 to 74\%) and
   97\% (95\% CI, 84 to 100\%), respectively. The area under the curve
   (AUC) in the SROC curve was 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.83). Conclusion:
   The current performance of the AI-based algorithm makes it more suitable
   as an adjunctive confirmatory tool rather than as an independent one for
   M2 occlusions. With the rapid development of such algorithms, it is
   anticipated that newer generations will likely perform much better. \&

Abstract = {Our essay discusses an AI process developed for making art (AICAN), and
   the issues AI creativity raises for understanding art and artists in the
   21st century. Backed by our training in computer science (Elgammal) and
   art history (Mazzone), we argue for the consideration of AICAN's works
   as art, relate AICAN works to the contemporary art context, and urge a
   reconsideration of how we might define human and machine creativity. Our
   work in developing AI processes for art making, style analysis, and
   detecting large-scale style patterns in art history has led us to
   carefully consider the history and dynamics of human art-making and to
   examine how those patterns can be modeled and taught to the machine. We
   advocate for a connection between machine creativity and art broadly
   defined as parallel to but not in conflict with human artists and their
   emotional and social intentions of art making. Rather, we urge a
   partnership between human and machine creativity when called for, seeing
   in this collaboration a means to maximize both partners' creative
   strengths.},

   Students' Psychological Education Based on Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {It is true that with society entering a new era, the pressure of
   competition for employment of college students is increasing, and
   society has higher requirements for the quality of high-tech talents,
   which can result in mental health issues for college students.
   Therefore, focusing on psychological education for college students and
   improving their psychological quality is essential. The analysis and
   countermeasure research on psychological characteristics has become
   crucial in this context. To address this issue, this work proposes an
   Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) Deep Belief Network (DBN)
   method to analyze the psychological characteristics of college students.
   The proposed method first uses DBN to analyze the psychological
   characteristics of college students. Secondly, the learning factors and
   inertia weights in PSO are dynamically adjusted to construct IPSO to
   address the problem of slow overall convergence speed caused by the
   initial randomization of weights in the DBN training process. IPSO is
   then combined with DBN to adjust the initial weights for DBN training.
   This work also proposes a series of countermeasures from different
   aspects to strengthen mental health education for college students. The
   validity of IPSO-DBN for college students' psychological characteristics
   analysis is verified through comprehensive and systematic experiments,
   and the feasibility of college students' mental health education
   countermeasures is confirmed via comparison. Overall, this work provides
   an innovative and effective approach for analyzing college students'
   psychological characteristics and developing countermeasures to improve
   their mental health. It shows the potential of combining artificial
   intelligence with psychological education and highlights the importance
   of strengthening psychological health education for college students.},

Abstract = {Education acts as an important part of economic growth and improvement
   in human welfare. The educational sectors have transformed a lot in
   recent days, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is an
   effective part of the education field. Almost every action in university
   and college, right from the process from counselling to admissions and
   fee deposits has been automated. Attendance records, quiz, evaluation,
   mark, and grade submissions involved the utilization of the ICT.
   Therefore, security is essential to accomplish cybersecurity in higher
   security institutions (HEIs). In this view, this study develops an
   Automated Outlier Detection for CyberSecurity in Higher Education
   Institutions (AOD-CSHEI) technique. The AOD-CSHEI technique intends to
   determine the presence of intrusions or attacks in the HEIs. The
   AOD-CSHEI technique initially performs data pre-processing in two stages
   namely data conversion and class labelling. In addition, the Adaptive
   Synthetic (ADASYN) technique is exploited for the removal of outliers in
   the data. Besides, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with deep neural
   network (DNN) model is used for the classification of data into the
   existence or absence of intrusions in the HEIs network. Finally, the SSA
   is utilized to effectually adjust the hyper parameters of the DNN
   approach. In order to showcase the enhanced performance of the AOD-CSHEI
   technique, a set of simulations take place on three benchmark datasets
   and the results reported the enhanced efficiency of the AOD-CSHEI
   technique over its compared methods with higher accuracy of 0.9997.},

   field of teaching and learning. As an important branch in the field of
   computer science and information technology, artificial intelligence
   technology contains many intersecting and comprehensive subject
   connotations, bringing brand-new elements to music education. It has
   also had an important impact on the development of music teaching. The
   article focuses in depth on the traditional process of music development
   in terms of the characteristics and ways of teaching music. Based on
   this, the article further explores the integration of artificial
   intelligence and music and analyses the role of emerging technologies as
   an aid to music from the perspective of the times. And this article uses
   emotion recognition as an evaluation index to explore the evaluation
   role of artificial intelligence technology in college music teaching,
   and improve the quality and efficiency of music teaching. The
   experimental results show that the teacher's positive emotion rate based
   on image data is 57.8\%, and the student's positive emotion rate is
   44.5\%; the teacher's positive emotion rate based on voice data is
   53.3\%, and the student's positive emotion rate is 51.1\%. The classroom
   emotion is negative at 7-13 minutes, the classroom emotion continues to
   be low at 28-40 minutes, and the teacher and student emotions are more
   positive at 13-28 minutes.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether an artificial intelligence candidate
   could pass the rapid (radiographic) reporting component of the
   Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) examination.
   DESIGN Prospective multi-reader diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING
   United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS One artificial intelligence candidate
   (Smarturgences, Milvue) and 26 radiologists who had passed the FRCR
   examination in the preceding 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accuracy
   and pass rate of the artificial intelligence compared with radiologists
   across 10 mock FRCR rapid reporting examinations (each examination
   containing 30 radiographs, requiring 90\% accuracy rate to pass).
   RESULTS When non-interpretable images were excluded from the analysis,
   the artificial intelligence candidate achieved an average overall
   accuracy of 79.5\% (95\% confidence interval 74.1\% to 84.3\%) and
   passed two of 10 mock FRCR examinations. The average radiologist
   achieved an average accuracy of 84.8\% (76.1-91.9\%) and passed four of
   10 mock examinations. The sensitivity for the artificial intelligence
   was 83.6\% (95\% confidence interval 76.2\% to 89.4\%) and the
   specificity was 75.2\% (66.7\% to 82.5\%), compared with summary
   estimates across all radiologists of 84.1\% (81.0\% to 87.0\%) and
   87.3\% (85.0\% to 89.3\%). Across 148/300 radiographs that were
   correctly interpreted by >90\% of radiologists, the artificial
   intelligence candidate was incorrect in 14/148 (9\%). In 20/300
   radiographs that most (>50\%) radiologists interpreted incorrectly, the
   artificial intelligence candidate was correct in 10/20 (50\%). Most
   imaging pitfalls related to interpretation of musculoskeletal rather
   than chest radiographs. CONCLUSIONS When special dispensation for the
   artificial intelligence candidate was provided (that is, exclusion of
   non-interpretable images), the artificial intelligence candidate was
   able to pass two of 10 mock examinations. Potential exists for the
   artificial intelligence candidate to improve its radiographic
   interpretation skills by focusing on musculoskeletal cases and learning
   to interpret radiographs of the axial skeleton and abdomen that are
   currently considered ``non-interpretable.{''}},

Abstract = {As a direct and effective biometric technology that follows human life
   habits, facial recognition has gradually become a mainstream, stable and
   reliable recognition method in the process of further development of
   science and technology. Facial recognition is a kind of biometric
   authentication based on recognition technology that is an original
   biological characteristic. After collecting the biometric functions, use
   a computer for digital image processing and template matching to
   complete the process of facial recognition. In the face of MOOC,
   establish a high-quality resource sharing mechanism, use this
   opportunity to explore innovative education models, and truly feel the
   strong momentum of traditional Chinese higher education, which has
   greatly improved the quality of education in Chinese universities. In
   addition, in order to vigorously promote the internationalization of
   education in China, education scholars need to conduct a lot of in-depth
   research on MOOC. In this article, a demand-based testing method is used
   to establish a skin color distribution model for color image
   preprocessing, and then develop and construct according to the
   comprehensive analysis of the university English class in the MOOC
   platform implementation mechanism (including the establishment of basic
   principles of operation mechanism), thereby become a guarantee and
   support for curriculum and education quality evaluation system. This
   article combines the characteristics of educational practice and MOOC
   education, takes college English courses as an example, studies its
   application mechanism, builds a MOOC platform, and continuously enhances
   students' interest in learning English, aiming to provide a practical
   reference for the reform of Chinese college English education.},

Abstract = {The advent of advances in machine learning (ML)-based techniques has
   popularized wide applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in various
   fields ranging from robotics to medicine. In recent years, there has
   been a surge in the application of AI to research in cardiovascular
   medicine, which is largely driven by the availability of large-scale
   clinical and multi-omics datasets. Such applications are providing a new
   perspective for a better understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD),
   which could be used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic
   strategies. For example, studies have shown that ML has a substantial
   potential for early diagnosis of different types of CVD, prediction of
   adverse disease outcomes such as heart failure, and development of newer
   and personalized treatments. In this article, we provide an overview and
   discuss the current status of a wide range of AI applications, including

Title = {Clinical Utility and Functionality of an Artificial Intelligence-Based
   App to Predict Mortality in COVID-19: Mixed Methods Analysis},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: The artificial neural network (ANN) is an increasingly
   important tool in the context of solving complex medical classification
   problems. However, one of the principal challenges in leveraging
   artificial intelligence technology in the health care setting has been
   the relative inability to translate models into clinician workflow.
   Objective: Here we demonstrate the development of a COVID-19 outcome
   prediction app that utilizes an ANN and assesses its usability in the
   clinical setting.
   Methods: Usability assessment was conducted using the app, followed by a
   semistructured end-user interview. Usability was specified by
   effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction measures. These data were
   reported with descriptive statistics. The end-user interview data were
   analyzed using the thematic framework method, which allowed for the
   development of themes from the interview narratives. In total, 31
   National Health Service physicians at a West London teaching hospital,
   including foundation physicians, senior house officers, registrars, and
   consultants, were included in this study.
   Results: All participants were able to complete the assessment, with a
   mean time to complete separate patient vignettes of 59.35 (SD 10.35)
   seconds. The mean system usability scale score was 91.94 (SD 8.54),
   which corresponds to a qualitative rating of ``excellent.{''} The
   clinicians found the app intuitive and easy to use, with the majority
   describing its predictions as a useful adjunct to their clinical
   practice. The main concern was related to the use of the app in
   isolation rather than in conjunction with other clinical parameters.
   However, most clinicians speculated that the app could positively
   reinforce or validate their clinical decision-making.
   Conclusions: Translating artificial intelligence technologies into the
   clinical setting remains an important but challenging task. We
   demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and system usability of a
   web-based app designed to predict the outcomes of patients with COVID-19
   from an ANN.},

   applying unsupervised learning, results show 3 main profiles from the
   clusters obtained in the simulations: students who work continuously,
   those who do it in the last-minute, and those with a low performance in
   the whole autonomous learning. We have found that the highest success
   ratio is related to students that work in a continuous basis. However,
   last-minute working is not necessarily linked to failure. We have also
   found that students' marks can be predicted successfully taking into
   account the whole data sets. However, predictions are worse when
   removing data from the month before the final exam. These predictions
   are useful to prevent students' wrong learning strategies, and to detect
   malpractices such as copying. We have done all these analyses taking
   into account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, founding that students
   worked in a more continuous basis in the confinement. This effect was
   still present one year after. Finally, We have also included an analysis
   of the techniques that could be more effective to keep in a future
   non-pandemic scenario the good habits that were detected in the
   confinement.},

Abstract = {Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and
   open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to
   help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain
   massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to
   identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This
   study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with
   dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining
   technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In
   previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this
   study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real
   time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial
   intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students'
   learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine.
   The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group
   searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this
   agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The
   learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better
   than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the
   experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control
   group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the
   learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater
   than that of students who used the Google search engine. This
   illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science
   articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of
   academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {Malaysia citizens are categorized into three different income groups
   which are the Top 20 Percent (T20), Middle 40 Percent (M40), and Bottom
   40 Percent (B40). One of the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan
   (11MP) is to elevate the B40 household group towards the middle-income
   society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households belong to
   this group. The government of Malaysia has widened access to higher
   education for the B40 group in an effort to reduce the gaps in
   socioeconomics and to improve their living standards. Statistical data
   shows that since 2013, a yearly intake of students in bachelor's degree
   programs in Malaysia's public universities amounts to more than 85,000.
   Despite this huge number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate,
   including students from low-income family background. Data mining
   approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used
   effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping out
   in general education. However, machine learning related works on student
   attrition in Malaysia's higher education is generally lacking.
   Therefore, in this research, three machine learning models were
   developed using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural
   Network algorithm in order to classify attrition among B40 students in
   bachelor's degree programs in Malaysia's public universities.
   Comparative performance analysis between the three models indicates that
   the Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student
   attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the other two
   models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with the
   value of 95.93\%, 97.10\%, 81.26\% and 88.50\%, respectively.
   Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant difference in
   performance between the Random Forest model and Decision Tree model but
   no statistically significant difference between Random Forest models and
   Artificial Neural Network model.},

Title = {Deep-LIBRA: An artificial-intelligence method for robust quantification
   of breast density with independent validation in breast cancer risk
   assessment},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {73},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Breast density is an important risk factor for breast cancer that also
   affects the specificity and sensitivity of screening mammography.
   Current federal legislation mandates reporting of breast density for all
   women undergoing breast cancer screening. Clinically, breast density is
   assessed visually using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging
   Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) scale. Here, we introduce an
   artificial intelligence (AI) method to estimate breast density from
   digital mammograms. Our method leverages deep learning using two
   convolutional neural network architectures to accurately segment the
   breast area. An AI algorithm combining superpixel generation and
   radiomic machine learning is then applied to differentiate dense from
   non-dense tissue regions within the breast, from which breast density is
   estimated. Our method was trained and validated on a multi-racial,
   multi-institutional dataset of 15,661 images (4,437 women), and then
   tested on an independent matched case-control dataset of 6368 digital
   mammograms (414 cases; 1178 controls) for both breast density estimation
   and case-control discrimination. On the independent dataset, breast
   percent density (PD) estimates from Deep-LIBRA and an expert reader were
   strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.90). Moreover,
   in a model adjusted for age and BMI, Deep-LIBRA yielded a higher
   case-control discrimination performance (area under the ROC curve, AUC =
   0.612 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.584, 0.640]) compared to four
   other widely-used research and commercial breast density assessment
   methods (AUCs = 0.528 to 0.599). Our results suggest a strong agreement
   of breast density estimates between Deep-LIBRA and gold-standard
   assessment by an expert reader, as well as improved performance in
   breast cancer risk assessment over state-of-the-art open-source and
   commercial methods. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   Food Industry},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {The food processing and handling industry is the most significant
   business among the various manufacturing industries in the entire world
   that subsidize the highest employability. The human workforce plays an
   essential role in the smooth execution of the production and packaging
   of food products. Due to the involvement of humans, the food industries
   are failing to maintain the demand-supply chain and also lacking in food
   safety. To overcome these issues of food industries, industrial
   automation is the best possible solution. Automation is completely based
   on artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) or deep
   learning (DL) algorithms. By using the AI-based system, food production
   and delivery processes can be efficiently handled and also enhance the
   operational competence. This article is going to explain the AI
   applications in the food industry which recommends a huge amount of
   capital saving with maximizing resource utilization by reducing human
   error. Artificial intelligence with data science can improve the quality
   of restaurants, cafes, online delivery food chains, hotels, and food
   outlets by increasing production utilizing different fitting algorithms
   for sales prediction. AI could significantly improve packaging,
   increasing shelf life, a combination of the menu by using AI algorithms,
   and food safety by making a more transparent supply chain management
   system. With the help of AI and ML, the future of food industries is
   completely based on smart farming, robotic farming, and drones.},

Abstract = {Early detection increases overall survival among patients with lung

   chest X-rays (CXRs) to detect lung cancer early. After we preprocessed
   our dataset using monochrome and brightness correction, we used
   different kinds of preprocessing methods to enhance image contrast and
   then used U-net to perform lung segmentation. We used 559 CXRs with a
   single lung nodule labeled by experts to train a You Only Look Once
   version 4 (YOLOv4) deep-learning architecture to detect lung nodules. In
   a testing dataset of 100 CXRs from patients at Taipei Veterans General
   Hospital and 154 CXRs from the Japanese Society of Radiological
   Technology dataset, the sensitivity of the AI model using a combination
   of different preprocessing methods performed the best at 79\%, with 3.04
   false positives per image. We then tested the AI by using 383 sets of
   CXRs obtained in the past 5 years prior to lung cancer diagnoses. The
   median time from detection to diagnosis for radiologists assisted with
   AI was 46 (3-523) days, longer than that for radiologists (8 (0-263)
   days). The AI model can assist radiologists in the early detection of

Abstract = {Accurate forecasting of key hydrological processes, such as rainfall,
   generally requires the use of auxiliary predictive hydrological
   variables. Data requirements can be reduced by using artificial
   intelligence models that are able to successfully capture the
   information contained in the historic observations of the target
   variable of interest. In this study, a novel Wavelet-coupled Multi-order
   Time Lagged Neural Network (WMTLNN) model is developed to accurately
   forecast rainfall by using previous rainfall records only. The study is
   conducted using daily rainfall data recorded in the period 2015-2017 at
   three meteorological stations (Astore, Chillas, and Gilgit) located in
   Upper Indus Basin (UIB), Pakistan. WMTLNN models are developed by
   introducing time lags up to ten days, Symlets 4 (sym4) wavelets and
   Daubechies wavelets with three vanishing moments (db3), and Maximal
   Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transformation (MODWT) to account for boundary
   effects in the forecasting mode. The performance of WMTLNN models is
   compared with that of Time Lagged Neural Network (TLNN) models,
   Wavelet-coupled Time Lagged Neural Network (WTLNN), and deep learning
   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Comparative analysis indicates
   that WMTLNN models overcome the other models, with more than 80\%
   forecasting accuracy for most of the cases, and a typical range of
   0.85-0.95 accuracy in terms of NSE. The highest NSE value is 0.97 at
   Astore with LSTM model, 0.96 at Chillas with WMTLNN model, and 0.95 at
   Gilgit with WMTLNN model. Overall, wavelet transformation of time series
   data enhances efficiency and accuracy of rainfall forecast.},

Abstract = {Background: Atherosclerosis evaluation by coronary computed tomography
   angiography (CCTA) is promising for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk
   stratification, but time consuming and requires high expertise.
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to CCTA for comprehensive CAD
   assessment may overcome these limitations. We hypothesized AI aided
   analysis allows for rapid, accurate evaluation of vessel morphology and
   stenosis. Methods: This was a multi-site study of 232 patients
   undergoing CCTA. Studies were analyzed by FDA-cleared software service
   that performs AI-driven coronary artery segmentation and labeling, lumen
   and vessel wall determination, plaque quantification and
   characterization with comparison to ground truth of consensus by three
   L3 readers. CCTAs were analyzed for: \% maximal diameter stenosis,
   plaque volume and composition, presence of high-risk plaque and Coronary
   Artery Disease Reporting \& Data System (CAD-RADS) category. Results: AI
   performance was excellent for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
   positive predictive value and negative predictive value as follows:
   >70\% stenosis: 99.7\%, 90.9\%, 99.8\%, 93.3\%, 99.9\%, respectively;
   >50\% stenosis: 94.8\%, 80.0\%, 97.0, 80.0\%, 97.0\%, respectively.
   Bland-Altman plots depict agreement between expert reader and AI
   determined maximal diameter stenosis for per-vessel (mean
   difference-0.8\%; 95\% CI 13.8\% to-15.3\%) and per-patient (mean
   difference-2.3\%; 95\% CI 15.8\% to-20.4\%). L3 and AI agreed within one
   CAD-RADS category in 228/232 (98.3\%) exams per-patient and 923/924
   (99.9\%) vessels on a per-vessel basis. There was a wide range of
   atherosclerosis in the coronary artery territories assessed by AI when
   stratified by CAD-RADS distribution . Conclusions: AI-aided approach to
   CCTA interpretation determines coronary stenosis and CAD-RADS category
   in close agreement with consensus of L3 expert readers. There was a wide
   range of atherosclerosis identified through AI.},

Abstract = {With the development of 5G technology and Internet of Things, all kinds
   of real life data are collected and recorded by a large number of
   sensors. It is of great significance to mine and analyze the hidden
   information in the data for applications like future prediction.
   However, due to interferences or instability of collection equipment,
   collected sensory data are often incomplete, and this incompleteness
   hinders the in-depth analysis of data in the cloud. Therefore,
   processing around missing values is significant. Relying on cloud
   machine learning methods is not enough to deal with the problem of
   missing data in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
   environment, however, edge computing provides a promising solution. In
   this article, gated recurrent units filling is employed at the edge
   nodes. A mobile edge node can not only find the historical information
   of the current missing data node but also acquire the data of the nodes
   adjacent to the missing data node. These ensure that the missing data
   are restored to the maximum extent at the source. The experimental
   results show that the missing value filling based on edge computing not
   only outperforms other filling methods in quality but also greatly
   reduces the energy consumption in AIoT.},

Abstract = {In recent years, single societies and aging societies around the
   worldwide increasingly seen the emerging problem of loneliness and the
   growing need for companionship. To satisfy the need, the population of
   pet keepers is growing, and the proportion of households with pets is
   increasing. It is normal to have pets at home. Pet fish are kept not
   only for companionship but also to relieve the stress accumulated
   throughout the day, and they can also improve the quality of life and
   health of older individuals. Having a pet can help reduce anxiety and
   increase food intake in people with medical conditions. This article
   proposes a smart seawater aquarium system based on the artificial
   intelligence of things (AIoT) technology to lower the knowledge
   threshold for keeping seahorses or other marine fish as pets. The
   proposed system provides seawater fish owners with safe and convenient
   feeding methods and more pet-friendly and user-friendly choices of
   interactive pet care and improves the comfort and survival rate of
   marine life in seawater aquariums. This smart seawater aquarium system
   can automatically or manually adjust water quality, water temperature,
   and oxygen content in water, change the water, feed fish, and monitor
   underwater fish in real time. It solves the problem of neglecting pet
   fish and the difficulty of maintaining seawater aquariums. Moreover, the
   proposed system incorporates a cloud-based information system and a
   web-based platform for data transmission and interface control, and it
   has achieved the purposes of remote and local monitoring of the
   aquarium.},

Abstract = {How do we teach and learn with our students about data literacy, at the
   same time as Biesta (2015) calls for an emphasis on `subjectification'
   i.e. `the coming into presence of unique individual beings'? (Good
   Education in an Age of Measurement: Ethics, Politics, Democracy.
   Routledge) Our response to these challenges and the datafication of
   higher education, is a hands-on approach to building an open,
   collaborative pedagogy of data literacy, based on Bayesian Networks
   (BNs) (Pearl, J. 1985. Bayesian Networks: A Model of Self-Activated
   Memory for Evidential Reasoning. Los Angeles: University of California
   (Computer Science Department)). BNs can be used to merge subjective
   views of the learning process with objective data analysis from the
   learning environment; BNs are visual data constructs and, unlike other
   Machine Learning approaches that obfuscate and complexify, BNs can be
   developed to reveal relationships from observations. In this paper, we
   share ways in which teachers and students can work together in a praxis
   approach to use data to `read the world' around them (Freire, P. 1970.
   Pedagogy of the Oppressed. New York: Continuum. 125).},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence for Aortic Pressure Waveform Analysis During
   Coronary Angiography Machine Learning for Patient Safety},

Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study developed a neural network to perform automated
   pressure waveform analysis and allow real-time accurate identification
   of damping.
   BACKGROUND Damping of aortic pressure during coronary angiography must
   be identified to avoid serious complications and make accurate coronary
   physiology measurements. There are currently no automated methods to do
   this, and so identification of damping requires constant monitoring,
   which is prone to human error.
   METHODS The neural network was trained and tested versus core laboratory
   expert opinions derived from 2 separate datasets. A total of 5,709
   aortic pressure waveforms of individual heart beats were extracted and
   classified. The study developed a recurrent convolutional neural network
   to classify beats as either normal, showing damping, or artifactual.
   Accuracies were reported using the opinions of 2 independent core
   laboratories.
   RESULTS The neural network was 99.4\% accurate (95\% confidence
   interval: 98.8\% to 99.6\%) at classifying beats from the testing
   dataset when judged against the opinions of the internal core
   laboratory. It was 98.7\% accurate (95\% confidence interval: 98.0\% to
   99.2\%) when judged against the opinions of an external core laboratory
   not involved in neural network training. The neural network was 100\%
   sensitive, with no beats classified as damped misclassified, with a
   specificity of 99.8\%. The positive predictive and negative predictive
   values were 98.1\% and 99.5\%. The 2 core laboratories agreed more
   closely with the neural network than with each other.
   CONCLUSIONS Arterial waveform analysis using neural networks allows
   rapid and accurate identification of damping. This demonstrates how
   machine learning can assist with patient safety and the quality control
   of procedures. (C) 2019 by the American College of Cardiology

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Based Detection of Human Embryo Components for
   Assisted Reproduction by In Vitro Fertilization},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing
   infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful
   pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of those assisted
   reproduction methods in which the sperm and eggs are combined outside
   the human body in a specialized environment and kept for growth.
   Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing
   infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful
   pregnancy. The morphology of the embryological components is highly
   related to the success of the assisted reproduction procedure. In
   approximately 3-5 days, the embryo transforms into the blastocyst. To
   prevent the multiple-birth risk and to increase the chance of pregnancy
   the embryologist manually analyzes the blastocyst components and selects
   valuable embryos to transfer to the women's uterus. The manual
   microscopic analysis of blastocyst components, such as trophectoderm,
   zona pellucida, blastocoel, and inner cell mass, is time-consuming and
   requires keen expertise to select a viable embryo. Artificial
   intelligence is easing medical procedures by the successful
   implementation of deep learning algorithms that mimic the medical
   doctor's knowledge to provide a better diagnostic procedure that helps
   in reducing the diagnostic burden. The deep learning-based automatic
   detection of these blastocyst components can help to analyze the
   morphological properties to select viable embryos. This research
   presents a deep learning-based embryo component segmentation network
   (ECS-Net) that accurately detects trophectoderm, zona pellucida,
   blastocoel, and inner cell mass for embryological analysis. The proposed
   method (ECS-Net) is based on a shallow deep segmentation network that
   uses two separate streams produced by a base convolutional block and a
   depth-wise separable convolutional block. Both streams are densely
   concatenated in combination with two dense skip paths to produce
   powerful features before and after upsampling. The proposed ECS-Net is
   evaluated on a publicly available microscopic blastocyst image dataset,
   the experimental segmentation results confirm the efficacy of the
   proposed method. The proposed ECS-Net is providing a mean Jaccard Index
   (Mean JI) of 85.93\% for embryological analysis.},

Abstract = {After mankind entered the 20th century, a young science with a history
   of only 60 years, artificial intelligence technology, is affecting the
   world in its own unique way. Artificial intelligence technology is known
   as one of the three major scientific and technological achievements of
   this century. The applications of artificial intelligence technology
   include machine learning, expert systems, pattern recognition, natural
   language processing, artificial neural networks, and robots. Two classes
   (n = 42) were randomly selected in the experiment, namely, the
   experimental group and the control group. The control group adopts
   traditional methods of teacher explanation, demonstration, and practice.
   The experimental group uses a combination of feedback and traditional
   teaching methods to teach. The students in the experimental group and
   the control group are compared in the early and late stages of the
   swimming skills video. Finally, the characteristic parameters of
   swimming techniques are compared and analyzed. Experimental data showed
   that the average score of students in the experimental group was 32.38,
   and the average score of the control group was 28.43. The average
   technical evaluation score of the experimental group was 77.19, and the
   average technical evaluation score of the control group was 72.43. The
   experimental results show that the video feedback teaching method does
   play a certain role in improving students' technical movements and
   proficiency and improves the quality of teaching.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in orthopaedics: can Chat Generative Pre-trained
   Transformer (ChatGPT) pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal
   College of Surgeons (Trauma \& Orthopaedics) examination?},
Journal = {POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 6},
Abstract = {Purpose Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a large
   language artificial intelligence (AI) model which generates contextually
   relevant text in response to questioning. After ChatGPT successfully
   passed the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, proponents have
   argued it should play an increasing role in medical service provision
   and education. AI in healthcare remains in its infancy, and the
   reliability of AI systems must be scrutinized. This study assessed
   whether ChatGPT could pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal
   College of Surgeons (FRCS) examination in Trauma and Orthopaedic
   Surgery. Methods The UK and Ireland In-Training Examination (UKITE) was
   used as a surrogate for the FRCS. Papers 1 and 2 of UKITE 2022 were
   directly inputted into ChatGPT. All questions were in a
   single-best-answer format without wording alterations. Imaging was
   trialled to ensure ChatGPT utilized this information. Results ChatGPT
   scored 35.8\%: 30\% lower than the FRCS pass rate and 8.2\% lower than
   the mean score achieved by human candidates of all training levels.
   Subspecialty analysis demonstrated ChatGPT scored highest in basic
   science (53.3\%) and lowest in trauma (0\%). In 87 questions answered
   incorrectly, ChatGPT only stated it did not know the answer once and
   gave incorrect explanatory answers for the remaining questions.
   Conclusion ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order
   judgement and multilogical thinking required to pass the FRCS
   examination. Further, the current model fails to recognize its own
   limitations. ChatGPT's deficiencies should be publicized equally as much
   as its successes to ensure clinicians remain aware of its fallibility.
   Key messages What is already known on this topic Following ChatGPT's
   much-publicized success in passing the United States Medical Licensing
   Examinations, clinicians and medical students are using the model
   increasingly frequently for medical service provision and education.
   However ChatGPT remains in its infancy, and the model's reliability and
   accuracy remain unproven. What this study adds This study demonstrates
   ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order judgement and
   multilogical thinking required to pass the Fellowship of the Royal
   College of Surgeons (FRCS) (Trauma \& Orthopaedics) examination.
   Further, the current model fails to recognize its own limitations when
   offering both direct and explanatory answers. How this study might
   affect research, practice, or policy This study highlights the need for
   medical students and clinicians to exert caution when employing ChatGPT
   as a revision tool or applying it in clinical practice, and for patients
   to be aware of its fallibilities when using it as a health resource.
   Future research questions include: How can the reliability of ChatGPT's
   responses be regulated moving forward? Do postgraduate examinations
   adequately focus on higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking
   rather than simple fact recall? Will future models of ChatGPT develop
   the higher-order judgement to pass the FRCS (Trauma \& Orthopaedics)
   examination?},

Abstract = {Chinese Sign Language (CSL) offers the main means of communication for
   the hearing impaired in China. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) can
   shorten the distance between the hearing-impaired and healthy people and
   help them integrate into the society. Therefore, SLR has become the
   focus of sign language application research. Over the years, the
   continuous development of new technologies provides a source and
   motivation for SLR. This paper aims to cover the most recent approaches
   in Chinese Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). With a thorough review of
   superior methods from 2000 to 2019 in CSLR researches, various
   techniques and algorithms such as scale-invariant feature transform,
   histogram of oriented gradients, wavelet entropy, Hu moment invariant,
   Fourier descriptor, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, dynamic time
   warping, principal component analysis, autoencoder, hidden Markov model
   (HMM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, skin color modeling
   method,k-NN, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network
   (CNN), and transfer learning are discussed in detail, which are based on
   several major stages, that is, data acquisition, preprocessing, feature
   extraction, and classification. CSLR was summarized from some aspect as
   follows: methods of classification and feature extraction,
   accuracy/performance evaluation, and sample size/datasets. The
   advantages and limitations of different CSLR approaches were compared.
   It was found that data acquisition is mainly through Kinect and camera,
   and the feature extraction focuses on hand's shape and spatiotemporal
   factors, but ignoring facial expressions. HMM and SVM are used most in
   the classification. CNN is becoming more and more popular, and a deep
   neural network-based recognition approach will be the future trend.
   However, due to the complexity of the contemporary Chinese language,
   CSLR generally has a lower accuracy than other SLR. It is necessary to
   establish an appropriate dataset to conduct comparable experiments. The
   issue of decreasing accuracy as the dataset increases needs to resolve.
   Overall, our study is hoped to give a comprehensive presentation for
   those people who are interested in CSLR and SLR and to further
   contribute to the future research.},

Abstract = {The significant interest in using of the blockchain technology in higher
   education for keeping secure student's records storage and retrieval is
   noted. This paper describes a new system based on blockchain approach to
   store students' records accumulated in the educational process at the
   higher institution in extended format. Every block of the records
   contains four types of information about student: academic activities,
   research participation, cultural activities and achievements. The system
   suggests participation of educational institution, student and potential
   employers in usage of integrated machine learning and blockchain
   technologies. The novelty of our paper is that the system allows
   university and student to keep complete and accurate data about the
   entire student learning process, avoid forgeries of educational records,
   e-portfolio inaccuracies and fabricated degrees. Additionally, it could
   be used by employers to find qualifying potential employees, using large
   amount of verified and systematically accumulated data.},

Title = {Smart classroom learning environment preferences of higher education
   teachers and students in China: An ecological perspective},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {By evaluating learners' perceived preferences for the learning
   environment, we can understand the important characteristics and better
   improve the learning environment, ultimately to provide great potential
   for the optimization of teaching practice. Seeing that the current
   research pays less attention to teachers' and students' preferences for
   the space environment simultaneously, based on the survey of 1937
   undergraduates and 107 teachers from a university in central China, this
   study aims to explore their preferences for smart learning environment.
   Based on the ecological theory and research results of the existing
   learning environment, this paper constructed an ecological model and a
   conceptual model of learning space preferences. An empirical study was
   conducted to explore the impact of sociodemographic variables on
   personal spatial preference. The results showed that teachers and
   students had a positive attitude towards the smart learning environment,
   and gender, age, grade, subject category and other variables had limited
   impact on spatial preference.},

   class in an experimental school, samples were taken from 821 students in
   the third grade parallel class, and 39 teachers taught students in
   accordance with their aptitude; finally, from the average score
   statistics of the first and second inspections, it can be seen that the
   intelligent classroom teaching of chemistry has a certain effect on

Abstract = {The OpenAI's ChatGPT-3, or Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer was
   released in November 2022 without significant warning, and has taken
   higher education by storm since. The artificial intelligence (AI)
   -powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect
   authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers
   predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an
   alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where
   educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning
   environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such
   students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively
   with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we
   acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic
   integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism,
   character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an
   enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT - like papermills,
   and degree factories before it - can be used to cheat on university
   exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better
   learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that
   offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for
   scholars.},

Abstract = {Investigation of the potential applications of artificial intelligence
   (AI), including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques,
   is an exponentially growing field in medicine and healthcare. These
   methods can be critical in providing high-quality care to patients with
   chronic rheumatological diseases lacking an optimal treatment, like
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is the second most prevalent autoimmune
   disease. Herein, following reviewing the basic concepts of AI, we
   summarize the advances in its applications in RA clinical practice and
   research. We provide directions for future investigations in this field
   after reviewing the current knowledge gaps and technical and ethical
   challenges in applying AI. Automated models have been largely used to
   improve RA diagnosis since the early 2000s, and they have used a wide
   variety of techniques, e.g., support vector machine, random forest, and
   artificial neural networks. AI algorithms can facilitate screening and
   identification of susceptible groups, diagnosis using omics, imaging,
   clinical, and sensor data, patient detection within electronic health
   record (EHR), i.e., phenotyping, treatment response assessment,
   monitoring disease course, determining prognosis, novel drug discovery,
   and enhancing basic science research. They can also aid in risk
   assessment for incidence of comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular
   diseases, in patients with RA. However, the proposed models may vary
   significantly in their performance and reliability. Despite the
   promising results achieved by AI models in enhancing early diagnosis and
   management of patients with RA, they are not fully ready to be
   incorporated into clinical practice. Future investigations are required
   to ensure development of reliable and generalizable algorithms while
   they carefully look for any potential source of bias or misconduct. We
   showed that a growing body of evidence supports the potential role of AI
   in revolutionizing screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with
   RA. However, multiple obstacles hinder clinical applications of AI
   models. Incorporating the machine and/or deep learning algorithms into
   real-world settings would be a key step in the progress of AI in
   medicine.},

Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 20},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate students' adoption
   intention (ADI) and actual usage (ATU) of artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based teacher bots (T-bots) for learning using technology adoption
   model (TAM) and context-specific variables.Design/methodology/approachA
   mixed-method design is used wherein the quantitative and qualitative
   approaches were used to explore the adoption of T-bots for learning.
   Overall, 45 principals/directors/deans/professors were interviewed and
   NVivo 8.0 was used for interview data analysis. Overall, 1,380 students
   of higher education institutes were surveyed, and the collected data was
   analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
   (PLS-SEM) technique.FindingsThe T-bot's ADI's antecedents found were
   perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, personalization,
   interactivity, perceived trust, anthropomorphism and perceived
   intelligence. The ADI influences the ATU of T-bots, and its relationship
   is negatively moderated by stickiness to learn from human teachers in
   the classroom. It comprehends the insights of senior authorities of the
   higher education institutions in India toward the adoption of
   T-bots.Practical implicationsThe research provides distinctive insights
   for principals, directors and professors in higher education institutes
   to understand the factors affecting the students' behavioral intention
   and use of T-bots. The developers and designers of T-bots need to ensure
   that T-bots are more interactive, provide personalized information to
   students and ensure the anthropomorphic characteristics of T-bots. The
   education policymakers can also comprehend the factors of T-bot adoption
   for developing the policies related to T-bots and their implications in
   education.Originality/valueT-bot is a new disruptive technology in the
   education sector, and this is the first step in exploring the adoption
   factors. The TAM model is extended with context-specific factors related
   to T-bot technology to offer a comprehensive explanatory power to the
   proposed model. The research outcome provides the unique antecedents of
   the adoption of T-bots.},

Abstract = {RationaleThe development of the complex thinking meta-competency in the
   education of university students potentially promotes high capacities,
   where artificial intelligence (AI) might work as a supporting structure.
   ObjectiveThis proof-of-concept study of an AI-based platform aimed to
   integrate a sequence of activities into the design of an online platform
   to assess the development of complex thinking competency in higher
   education students. MethodThe Transition Design method was used within
   an Ideathon event supported by an AI platform to provide students with a
   sharing economy challenge. A total of 31 university students from five
   university campuses in Mexico synchronously participated. An instrument
   was applied in the pre-test and post-test phases to explore the complex
   thinking meta-competency and its sub-competencies of critical,
   innovative, scientific, and systemic thinking. ResultsTwo hypotheses
   were tested, both of which turned out to be true: (a) the functioning of
   the constructed learning situation and (b) the model of the learning
   situation. ConclusionThese findings may be of value to scientific and
   academic communities, as well as social and business organizations
   interested in developing high capacities of complex thinking and
   educational innovations using digital platforms.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the effect of future environmental landscape design,
   this study combines artificial intelligence technology and digital space
   technology to construct an environmental landscape design system.
   Moreover, this study uses polygons to model external landscape plants
   instead of modeling the microelement structure of landscape plants and
   re-polygonize them, which simplifies the model structure of landscape
   plants and improves computational efficiency. In addition, this study
   conducts collision detection in the growth of landscape plants to make
   it more realistic and more efficient and studies and analyzes the
   digital construction of landscape plants. Finally, after constructing an
   intelligent system, the effect of the system in this study is verified.
   Through data analysis, it can be seen that the environmental landscape
   design system based on artificial intelligence and digital space
   technology proposed in this study has good digital space structure

Title = {Artificial intelligence versus expert: a comparison of rapid visual

Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {ObjectivesWe sought to create a deep learning algorithm to determine the
   degree of inferior vena cava (IVC) collapsibility in critically ill
   patients to enable novice point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) providers.
   MethodsWe used publicly available long short term memory (LSTM) deep
   learning basic architecture that can track temporal changes and
   relationships in real-time video, to create an algorithm for ultrasound
   video analysis. The algorithm was trained on public domain IVC
   ultrasound videos to improve its ability to recognize changes in varied
   ultrasound video. A total of 220 IVC videos were used, 10\% of the data
   was randomly used for cross correlation during training. Data were
   augmented through video rotation and manipulation to multiply effective
   training data quantity. After training, the algorithm was tested on the
   50 new IVC ultrasound video obtained from public domain sources and not
   part of the data set used in training or cross validation. Fleiss' kappa
   was calculated to compare level of agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
   and between deep learning algorithm and POCUS experts.
   ResultsThere was very substantial agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
   with kappa = 0.65 (95\% CI = 0.49-0.81). Agreement between experts and
   algorithm was moderate with kappa = 0.45 (95\% CI = 0.33-0.56).
   ConclusionsOur algorithm showed good agreement with POCUS experts in
   visually estimating degree of IVC collapsibility that has been shown in
   previously published studies to differentiate fluid responsive from
   fluid unresponsive septic shock patients. Such an algorithm could be
   adopted to run in real-time on any ultrasound machine with a video
   output, easing the burden on novice POCUS users by limiting their task
   to obtaining and maintaining a sagittal proximal IVC view and allowing
   the artificial intelligence make real-time determinations.},

Abstract = {Big data technology helps with any real-world problem involving a large
   amount of data. The cost of dealing with huge amounts of data is reduced
   by deploying big data technologies on cloud-based infrastructure. New
   technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR)
   rapidly transform the gaming industry. It is possible that blockchain
   technology could transform gaming from a pastime into a potential source
   of income. A standard learning system cannot meet students' unique
   learning requirements; therefore, an intelligent system must be
   developed. This article explores the development of an intelligent
   higher education system based on big data (IHES-BD). Using big data,
   teachers assess and predict the learning behavior of their students. The
   effect of their lessons can be relayed back to them to help students
   develop knowledge; it connects knowledge points related to the issues.
   According to the study's findings, the average time spent weekly playing
   video games is 12 hours. The gaming industry could reap huge rewards if
   video game participation continues to rise.},

Abstract = {Aerobic is loved by the public, especially the young people, through the
   combination of the art and power of dance. With people's attention to
   health, the demand for aerobic professionals is increasing. As an
   important training base for aerobic professionals, the level and
   teaching ability of aerobic professionals have a great influence on
   students. The gradual maturity and rapid popularization of artificial
   intelligence bring many opportunities and challenges to the teaching of
   physical education in colleges and universities. Only by seizing the
   opportunities and facing the challenges, excavating their own existing
   problems, and transforming with the help of artificial intelligence can
   we adapt to the development trend of educational modernization in China.
   In order to increase the standardization and standardization of aerobics
   and provide executable standards for aerobic learning, performance, and
   adjudication, through the research on the training strategy of aerobic
   sports talents under the background of artificial intelligence era,
   capture aerobic performance actions with artificial intelligence
   awareness, standardize and standardize aerobics, and discuss the
   teaching effect of school intelligent aerobics, it is found that this
   study not only has important physical education teaching value but also
   relates to the application prospect of artificial intelligence
   technology in aerobic physical education talent training strategy.},

Abstract = {Miscommunication between instructors and students is a significant
   obstacle to post-secondary learning. Students may skip office hours due
   to insecurities or scheduling conflicts, which can lead to missed
   opportunities for questions. To support self-paced learning and
   encourage creative thinking skills, academic institutions must redefine
   their approach to education by offering flexible educational pathways
   that recognize continuous learning. To this end, we developed an
   AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on a
   powerful language model (i.e., GPT-3) that automatically generates
   course-specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or
   academic level. The virtual intelligent teaching assistant (TA) system,
   which is at the core of our framework, serves as a voice-enabled helper
   capable of answering a wide range of course-specific questions, from
   curriculum to logistics and course policies. By providing students with
   easy access to this information, the virtual TA can help to improve
   engagement and reduce barriers to learning. At the same time, it can
   also help to reduce the logistical workload for instructors and TAs,
   freeing up their time to focus on other aspects of teaching and
   supporting students. Its GPT-3-based knowledge discovery component and
   the generalized system architecture are presented accompanied by a
   methodical evaluation of the system's accuracy and performance.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence can bring convenience to human life. In the
   field of sports rehabilitation, the application of artificial
   intelligence is becoming more and more in-depth. This paper is aimed at
   studying the prevention and detection of sports rehabilitation in the
   context of artificial intelligence and proposing a compliance control
   method for lower limb rehabilitation robots based on artificial neural
   networks. In this paper, a double closed-loop control system is
   designed: the outer loop is an adaptive impedance control model based on
   sEMG feedback, and the purpose is to adjust the predicted desired joint
   trajectories. In the inner loop, a sliding mode iterative learning
   controller is designed to suppress periodic disturbance and abnormal
   jitter and achieve stable tracking of the target trajectory. Finally,
   the control method is simulated and verified by matlab/simulink, and a
   statistical experiment is done on the patient's recovery. The
   experimental results show that the use of artificial intelligence
   technology can effectively increase the sensitivity of the control
   system and improve the recovery rate of patients. Compared with the
   traditional sports rehabilitation control system, the sensitivity is
   increased by 22.7\%, and the patient recovery rate is increased by
   10.4\%, which is of great significance in the field of sports
   rehabilitation.},

Abstract = {Higher education, which has the function of cultivating human capital,
   has already become a key focus of developed countries around the world.
   From ministries of education to higher education institutions, many
   bodies are dedicated to enhancing student learning outcomes. However,
   social and educational problems derived from disadvantaged groups have
   long been hindering the development of individuals and the whole
   country. This study examines the learning motivations of economically
   disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged college students and evaluates
   the relationship between learning modes and learning outcomes from a
   self-determination theory (SDT) perspective. In this study, 817 valid
   questionnaires were collected to compare the two sample groups in terms
   of learning path. The results show that non-economically disadvantaged
   students have superior outcomes compared to disadvantaged students in
   terms of role identity, academic identity, explorative learning,
   exploitative learning, and cognitive and non-cognitive gains. In regard
   to path analysis, economically disadvantaged students are significantly
   superior to non-disadvantaged students in the face of positive influence
   of academic identity on different learning modes and positive influence
   of explorative learning on cognitive and non-cognitive gains. Finally,
   based on the conclusions, this study proposes some suggestions specific
   to theoretical mode for future study.},

Abstract = {The world has been challenged since late 2019 by COVID-19. Higher
   education institutions have faced various challenges in adapting online
   education to control the pandemic spread of COVID-19. The present study
   aims to conduct a survey study through the interview and scrutinizing
   the literature to find the key challenges. Subsequently, an integrated
   MCDM framework, including Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis
   (SWARA) and Multiple Objective Optimization based on Ratio Analysis plus
   Full Multiplicative Form (MULTIMOORA), is developed. The SWARA procedure
   is applied to the analysis and assesses the challenges to adapt the
   online education during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the MULTIMOORA
   approach is utilized to rank the higher education institutions on
   hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, an illustrative case study is considered
   to express the proposed idea's feasibility and efficacy in real-world
   decision-making. Finally, the obtained result is compared with other
   existing approaches, confirming the proposed framework's strength and
   steadiness. The identified challenges were systemic, pedagogical, and
   psychological challenges, while the analysis results found that the
   pedagogical challenges, including the lack of experience and student
   engagement, were the main essential challenges to adapting online
   education in higher education institutions during the COVID-19 outbreak.},

Abstract = {With the coming of the era of artificial intelligence development and
   the mobile Internet of things, privacy security will become more and
   more prominent. As the contemporary college students have gradually
   developed into one of the main forces of the next generation of network
   information technology and intelligent terminals of Internet mobile
   communication, the problem of privacy and protection of college students
   in the era of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has
   naturally become a practical problem urgently solved by colleges and
   universities. This paper studies the application of ``artificial
   intelligence + Internet of Things{''} (AIoT) in the construction and
   management of intelligent campus for student privacy protection.
   Firstly, some basic concepts and theories related to artificial
   intelligence and the Internet of Things are summarized, and the basic
   technical framework of ``Artificial intelligence + Internet of
   Things{''} (AIoT) is preliminarily explained and analyzed. Secondly,
   relevant simulation experiments are carried out, and data support and
   help are provided for subsequent solutions and management methods by
   analyzing the simulation results. Through the investigation and analysis
   of the intelligent campus construction and management based on student
   privacy protection under the background of artificial intelligence and
   the Internet of Things, the final research results show that the
   background of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has a
   great role in promoting the function of student privacy protection, so
   this research has an important guiding role for student privacy
   protection in the context of artificial intelligence and the Internet of
   Things.},

Title = {An Explainable Artificial Intelligence Framework for the Deterioration
   Risk Prediction of Hepatitis Patients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence-based computer aided diagnosis
   (CAD) system for the hepatitis has made great progress. Especially, the
   complex models such as deep learning achieve better performance than the
   simple ones due to the nonlinear hypotheses of the real world clinical
   data. However,complex model as a black box, which ignores why it make a
   certain decision, causes the model distrust from clinicians. To solve
   these issues, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework is
   proposed in this paper to give the global and local interpretation of
   auxiliary diagnosis of hepatitis while retaining the good prediction
   performance. First, a public hepatitis classification benchmark from UCI
   is used to test the feasibility of the framework. Then, the transparent
   and black-box machine learning models are both employed to forecast the
   hepatitis deterioration. The transparent models such as logistic
   regression (LR), decision tree (DT)and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) are
   picked. While the black-box model such as the eXtreme Gradient Boosting
   (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF) are
   selected. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local
   Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Partial Dependence
   Plots (PDP) are utilized to improve the model interpretation of liver
   disease. The experimental results show that the complex models
   outperform the simple ones. The developed RF achieves the highest
   accuracy (91.9\%) among all the models. The proposed framework combining
   the global and local interpretable methods improves the transparency of
   complex models, and gets insight into the judgments from the complex
   models, thereby guiding the treatment strategy and improving the
   prognosis of hepatitis patients. In addition, the proposed framework
   could also assist the clinical data scientists to design a more
   appropriate structure of CAD.},

Title = {Online Homework Intelligent Platform Based on Self-Regulated Learning
   (SRL): Essential for Sustainable Development of Online Higher Education},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Online higher education has become a steadily more popular way of
   learning for university students in the post-pandemic era. It has been
   emphasized that active learning and interactive communication are key
   factors in achieving effective performance in online learning. However,
   due to the lack of learning motivation of students and the lack of
   feedback data in online learning, there are numerous problems, such as
   the weak self-discipline of students, unsatisfactory learning
   experience, a high plagiarism rate of homework, and the low utilization
   of online teaching resources. In this study, an online homework
   intelligent platform implemented by information technology (IT) was
   proposed. It was based on the pedagogical self-regulated learning (SRL)
   strategy as a theoretical foundation, and information technology as a
   driver. Through setting online homework assignments, a sustainable means
   of promoting the four components of the SRL strategy, i.e.,
   self-disciplinary control, independent thinking, reflective learning,
   and interest development, can be provided to university students.
   Therefore, this study explained the ``4A{''} functions in the platform
   and analysed the details of their implementation and value, such as
   assistance in locating resources, assignment of differentiated homework,
   assessment of warning learning, and achievement of sharing. After three
   years of continuous improvements since COVID-19, this online platform
   has been successfully applied to students and teachers at our university
   and other pilot universities. A comparison of student teaching data,
   questionnaire responses and teacher interviews from the Computer
   Composition Principles course illustrated the sustainability as well as
   the effectiveness of the method.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence enabled efficient power generation and emissions
   reduction underpinning net-zero goal from the coal-based power plants},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {268},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {A large power generation facility is a complex multi-criteria system
   associated with multivariate couplings, high dependency, and
   non-linearity among the operating variables which present a major
   challenge to ensure efficient power production. In this research, an
   integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and response surface methodology
   (AI-RSM) framework to achieve the efficient power production operation
   of a 660 MW coal power plant is presented. Two AI algorithms, i.e.,
   extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) are
   trained comprehensively on the power plant's operational data and are
   validated as well. Full factorial design of experiments on the three
   levels of the operating parameters are constructed and simulated from
   the better performing AI model which is an effective non-linear
   representation of the complex power plant operation. RSM analysis is
   carried out under three power generation scenarios to simulate the
   effective values of the operating variables which are tested on the
   power plant's operation and a reasonable agreement is found with the
   experimental observations. The notable improvement in fuel consumption
   rate, thermal efficiency, and heat rate of the power plant under Half
   Load, Mid Load, and Full Load capacity of the power plant is achieved by
   the AI-RSM framework enabled analyses. It is estimated that annual
   reduction in CO2, CH4 and Hg emissions measuring 210 kg tons per year
   (kt/y), 23.8 t/y and 2.7 kg/y, respectively can be obtained
   corresponding to Mid Load operating state of the power plant. The
   research presents the reliable and robust utilization of AI-RSM
   framework for simulating the effective operating conditions for the
   fossil-based power plants' operation with an eventual goal to improve
   the techno-environmental performance which is expected to contribute to
   net-zero emissions goal from the energy sector.},

Title = {Establishment of extensive artificial intelligence models for kinase
   inhibitor prediction: Identification of novel PDGFRB inhibitors},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {156},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Identifying hit compounds is an important step in drug development.
   Unfortunately, this process continues to be a challenging task. Several
   machine learning models have been generated to aid in simplifying and
   improving the prediction of candidate compounds. Models tuned for
   predicting kinase inhibitors have been established. However, an
   effective model can be limited by the size of the chosen training
   dataset. In this study, we tested several machine learning models to
   predict potential kinase inhibitors. A dataset was curated from a number
   of publicly available repositories. This resulted in a comprehensive
   dataset covering more than half of the human kinome. More than 2,000
   kinase models were established using different model approaches. The
   performances of the models were compared, and the Keras-MLP model was
   determined to be the best performing model. The model was then used to
   screen a chemical library for potential inhibitors targeting
   platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRB). Several PDGFRB
   candidates were selected, and in vitro assays confirmed four compounds
   with PDGFRB inhibitory activity and IC50 values in the nanomolar range.
   These results show the effectiveness of machine learning models trained
   on the reported dataset. This report would aid in the establishment of
   machine learning models as well as in the discovery of novel kinase
   inhibitors.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence of Internet of Things Based on Machine Learning
   and College Student Management},

Abstract = {Under the background of the development of higher education, according
   to the characteristics of college student management, after analyzing
   its background and practical significance, this study constructs an
   intelligent college student management system of Internet of things
   based on machine learning. The data volume of the Internet of things is
   huge, so ensuring the normal and efficient operation of the system is
   the primary goal. In this study, the data management model of the system
   is constructed with the help of cyclic neural network in machine
   learning algorithm to predict the data and optimize the computer
   program. At the same time, the system data are filled and classified by
   the k-nearest neighbor model, and the data are trained and simulated by
   constructing a safe bilstm neural network system. Because the
   information related to students in the university database involves
   personal privacy, in order to ensure the security of the system and
   avoid relevant data leakage, in the judgment standard of configuration
   error data flow, this study calculates the monitoring abnormal data and
   loss function through the dark network flow and ip2vec algorithm, so as
   to establish the system abnormal monitoring model and identify the
   system error data flow. Finally, it constructs the college student
   management system and expounds on the basic requirements of the system
   use cases. After a series of tests of system performance, capacity, and
   stability, the results meet the basic requirements of system operation,
   which provides a certain reference for the application of college
   student management in the future.},

Abstract = {Clinical performance of osseointegrated implants could be compromised by
   the medications taken by patients. The effect of a specific medication
   on osseointegration can be easily investigated using traditional
   systematic reviews. However, assessment of all known medications
   requires the use of evidence mapping methods. These methods allow
   assessment of complex questions, but they are very resource intensive
   when done manually. The objective of this study was to develop a machine
   learning algorithm to automatically map the literature assessing the
   effect of medications on osseointegration. Datasets of articles
   classified manually were used to train a machine-learning algorithm
   based on Support Vector Machines. The algorithm was then validated and
   used to screen 599,604 articles identified with an extremely sensitive
   search strategy. The algorithm included 281 relevant articles that
   described the effect of 31 different drugs on osseointegration. This
   approach achieved an accuracy of 95\%, and compared to manual screening,
   it reduced the workload by 93\%. The systematic mapping revealed that
   the treatment outcomes of osseointegrated medical devices could be
   influenced by drugs affecting homeostasis, inflammation, cell
   proliferation and bone remodeling. The effect of all known medications
   on the performance of osseointegrated medical devices can be assessed
   using evidence mappings executed with highly accurate machine learning
   algorithms. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Advancement in artificial intelligence for on-farm fruit sorting and
   transportation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {On-farm sorting and transportation of postharvest fruit include sorting
   out defective products, grading them into categories based on quality,
   distributing them into bins, and carrying bins to field collecting
   stations. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) can speed up on-farm
   sorting and transportation with high accuracy and robustness and
   significantly reduce postharvest losses. The primary objective of this
   literature review is to provide an overview to present a critical
   analysis and identify the challenges and opportunities of AI
   applications for on-farm sorting and transportation, with a focus on
   fruit. The challenges of on-farm sorting and transportation were
   discussed to specify the role of AI. Sensors and techniques for data
   acquisition were investigated to illustrate the tasks that AI models
   have addressed for on-farm sorting and transportation. AI models
   proposed in previous studies were compared to investigate the adequate
   approaches for on-farm sorting and transportation. Finally, the
   advantages and limitations of utilizing AI have been discussed, and
   in-depth analysis has been provided to identify future research
   directions. We anticipate that this survey will pave the way for further
   studies on the implementation of automated systems for on-farm fruit
   sorting and transportation.},

Abstract = {MooTools (MOOC) is an emerging teaching mode in higher education in
   recent years, which is rapidly developing and expanding into the
   traditional teaching field. Based on the characteristics of MOOC
   platform, this paper explores the intelligent teaching of ideology and

   proposed, which has the following characteristics: (1) comprehensive
   characteristics of learners are obtained through a combination of
   tracking and comprehensive evaluation, (2) secondary characteristics of
   learners are maintained to the instructor in an open and dynamic way,
   and (3) information of secondary characteristics is organized in the
   form of running accounts. Based on the two-level dynamic student model,
   the generalized fuzzy integrated evaluation method is used to evaluate
   the secondary characteristics of the learners. Through this project,
   effective improvement of students' course learning performance and

Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {In Chinese colleges, teachers' teaching level and proficiency in
   business knowledge are an important part of maintaining the knowledge
   system of colleges and universities. Therefore, in order to improve the
   teaching level of Chinese colleges and improve the knowledge reserve of
   college students, we should spare no effort to develop and improve the
   professional level of each teacher. The research on teacher training
   mode based on the development of teachers' teaching ability is of great
   significance to the development of colleges and the improvement of
   teaching quality. The new generation of artificial intelligence plays a
   pivotal role in the training of college teachers. This paper randomly
   selects 897 undergraduate teachers from 10 private colleges in a certain
   region of China who participate in higher teacher training for research.
   It mainly studies the application effect of several typical artificial
   intelligence technologies in evaluating higher teacher education and
   training. Specifically, the paper uses artificial intelligence as a
   carrier to predict the performance indicators of the three main modules
   involved in higher teacher education and training. The prediction
   results of several artificial intelligence techniques show that the
   support vector machine method based on immune algorithm optimization
   corresponds to the largest coefficient of determination and the smallest
   root mean square error. Therefore, it predicts the best. Furthermore,
   the comparison results between the predicted data and the measured data
   show that the artificial intelligence technology has a better prediction
   effect on the three module indicators. At the same time, there is a good
   exponential function relationship between the prediction data
   corresponding to the two main modules of organization and personnel.},

Title = {Analysis of Multimodal Teaching of College English under the Background
   of Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {As the Internet drives the spread of digitalization and the further
   improvement of computing power, the traditional college English teaching
   mode can no longer adapt to the needs of teaching in the age of
   artificial intelligence. Single or lesser modality is gradually replaced
   by multimodality, an emerging teaching mode. The study of multimodal
   discourse is a new hot spot in language research and a key issue of
   concern for English classroom teaching reform. Based on the analysis of
   the practical application dilemmas of multimodality in college English
   teaching culture, context, content (meaning + form), and expression,
   this article proposes a path to innovate multimodal discourse teaching
   in college English classroom in the era of artificial intelligence. It
   includes familiarizing with multimode integrated platform for teaching
   tools and developing intercultural communication abilities. Multimode
   situational lectures with the help of modern information technology are
   developed. At the content level, we should adhere to the unity and
   coordination of the meaning and form of multimodal teaching. Use
   language and nonlanguage in a way that will enhance learning at the
   multimode media level. Additionally, AI enriches English teaching
   methods, changes the intelligence of English teachers, and improves the
   efficiency of English teaching. AI helps to create a more relevant and
   interactive English learning environment, improve many aspects of
   English teaching, including teaching evaluation, and effectively improve
   the face of college English teaching.},

Abstract = {Most novice teachers and even some experienced teachers can lack
   appropriate tools for designing teaching strategies that ensure the
   quality of education. The ability of working in teams is crucial in
   educating professionals. The literature proves that social relations
   influence the performance of teams. For instance, the team cohesion is
   directly related with its performance. In this paper, we have developed
   an agent-based tool for assisting teachers in simulating their teaching
   strategies to estimate their influence on the group sociometrics like
   cohesion, coherence of reciprocal relations, dissociation, and density
   of relations. The experiments with nine scenarios in disciplines of
   computer science, electronic, psychology, business, tourism, and renewal
   energies with 239 students and 6 teachers including experienced and
   novice ones show that its underlying agent-based framework can adapt to
   different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We
   learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density
   of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most
   relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In
   addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction
   quality of the dissociation in higher education, due to the usual low
   amounts or absence of reciprocal rejections in the students' groups in
   this educational stage. The presented agent-based tool is publicly
   distributed as open source for facilitating other researchers in
   following this research line.},

Abstract = {The decision to integrate mobile cloud computing (MCC) in education
   without determining optimal use scenarios is a universal problem as the
   adoption of such services becomes widespread. Accordingly, this study
   developed and validated a predictive model that explains the role of
   students' information management (i.e. retrieve, store, share, and
   apply) practices in predicting their attitudes toward using the MCC
   services for educational purposes. This study validated the model by the
   complementary use of machine learning algorithms alongside a classical
   SEM-based approach based on data collected from 308 undergraduate
   students. The SEM results indicated that the students' information
   management (i.e. retrieve, store, share, and apply) practices were
   significantly associated with their attitudes, which were significantly
   associated with the behavioral intentions. The structural model
   explained a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral
   intentions. Likewise, the classifier model suggested that the students'
   information management practices and attitudes predicted the behavioral
   intentions. Further, the applied algorithms predicted the behavioral
   intentions with an accuracy of more than 72\% in most cases. Thereby,
   the study extended an original theory (TRA) into the MCC area by using a
   multi-analytical approach. The findings implied that employing the MCC
   services for personal information management should be supported and
   encouraged in the higher education by designing authentic learning
   environments and scaffolding the students in using such services.},

Title = {Perception of university students towards the use of artificial
   intelligence-generated voice in explainer videos},
Journal = {SEARCH-JOURNAL OF MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {77-89},
Note = {Search Conference, ELECTR NETWORK, 2022},
Abstract = {Explainer videos are on the rise, not just for marketing or sales
   purposes to highlight a product or business idea in a compelling and
   efficient way, but also as a learning tool to enhance instruction at all
   levels of learning. But though videos are increasingly part of education
   today, video production can be a time-consuming process, and this can be
   a barrier for educators who may not all be well-versed in or able to
   dedicate significant amounts of time to the creation of effective,
   interesting explainer videos that support their educational content. If
   it is possible to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voices for
   voice-overs in explainer videos, this would speed up the video creation
   process by allowing the creators to bypass the need to record a human -
   whether it is the video's creator or a separate actor - speaking the
   lines. This study explores the potential of AI-generated voices in
   explainer videos aimed at university students, specifically
   investigating students' responses to AI-generated voices by looking at
   whether they respond positively to the voice and whether there is any
   Uncanny Valley effect of revulsion towards it. The findings are based on
   a pilot study for university students, where participants were exposed
   to a set of explainer videos using different voice-overs (human voice,
   speaker notes app, and an AI-generated voice) and their responses
   recorded via a questionnaire with questions modified from Ho and
   Macdorman, 2010; Kroger et al., 2019; and Kuhne et al., 2020. The
   results show a preference for the more human-like voice-overs and no
   substantial negative perception of the AI-generated voices that were
   more human-like, indicating that AI-generated voices could potentially
   be more widely used in explainer videos at institutions of higher
   education.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence technology has advanced rapidly in recent years
   and has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes. However,
   technology uptake will be largely driven by clinicians, and there is a
   paucity of data regarding the attitude that clinicians have to this new
   technology. In June-August 2019 we conducted an online survey of fellows
   and trainees of three specialty colleges (ophthalmology,
   radiology/radiation oncology, dermatology) in Australia and New Zealand
   on artificial intelligence. There were 632 complete responses (n=305,
   230, and 97, respectively), equating to a response rate of 20.4\%,
   5.1\%, and 13.2\% for the above colleges, respectively. The majority
   (n=449, 71.0\%) believed artificial intelligence would improve their
   field of medicine, and that medical workforce needs would be impacted by
   the technology within the next decade (n=542, 85.8\%). Improved disease
   screening and streamlining of monotonous tasks were identified as key
   benefits of artificial intelligence. The divestment of healthcare to
   technology companies and medical liability implications were the
   greatest concerns. Education was identified as a priority to prepare
   clinicians for the implementation of artificial intelligence in
   healthcare. This survey highlights parallels between the perceptions of
   different clinician groups in Australia and New Zealand about artificial
   intelligence in medicine. Artificial intelligence was recognized as
   valuable technology that will have wide-ranging impacts on healthcare.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence, as one of the important representatives of
   information technology development, gradually penetrates into all fields

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Powered Smartphone App to Facilitate Medication
   Adherence: Protocol for a Human Factors Design Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Medication Guides consisting of crucial interactions and
   side effects are extensive and complex. Due to the exhaustive
   information, patients do not retain the necessary medication
   information, which can result in hospitalizations and medication
   nonadherence. A gap exists in understanding patients' cognition of
   managing complex medication information. However, advancements in
   technology and artificial intelligence (AI) allow us to understand
   patient cognitive processes to design an app to better provide important
   medication information to patients.
   Objective: Our objective is to improve the design of an innovative AI-
   and human factor-based interface that supports patients' medication
   information comprehension that could potentially improve medication
   adherence.
   Methods: This study has three aims. Aim 1 has three phases: (1) an
   observational study to understand patient perception of fear and biases
   regarding medication information, (2) an eye-tracking study to
   understand the attention locus for medication information, and (3) a
   psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm study to understand
   functionalities. Observational data will be collected, such as audio and
   video recordings, gaze mapping, and time from PRP. A total of 50
   patients, aged 18-65 years, who started at least one new medication, for
   which we developed visualization information, and who have a cognitive
   status of 34 during cognitive screening using the TICS-M test and health
   literacy level will be included in this aim of the study. In Aim 2, we
   will iteratively design and evaluate an AI-powered medication
   information visualization interface as a smartphone app with the
   knowledge gained from each component of Aim 1. The interface will be
   assessed through two usability surveys. A total of 300 patients, aged
   18-65 years, with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or mental health
   disorders, will be recruited for the surveys. Data from the surveys will
   be analyzed through exploratory factor analysis. In Aim 3, in order to
   test the prototype, there will be a two-arm study design. This aim will
   include 900 patients, aged 18-65 years, with internet access, without
   any cognitive impairment, and with at least two medications. Patients
   will be sequentially randomized. Three surveys will be used to assess
   the primary outcome of medication information comprehension and the
   secondary outcome of medication adherence at 12 weeks.
   Results: Preliminary data collection will be conducted in 2021, and
   results are expected to be published in 2022.
   Conclusions: This study will lead the future of AI-based, innovative,
   digital interface design and aid in improving medication comprehension,
   which may improve medication adherence. The results from this study will
   also open up future research opportunities in understanding how patients
   manage complex medication information and will inform the format and
   design for innovative, AI-powered digital interfaces for Medication
   Guides.},

Abstract = {Education is important for sustainable development and drives innovation
   within national innovation systems. As developed economies move to
   matured stages of the fourth industrial revolution, the quality of
   education needs to keep up with the required technological changes
   brought about by the digital transformation created by these
   technologies. However, studies on the impact of the digital
   transformation of the higher education system and its effect on
   sustainability are few. This study bridged this gap by providing
   empirical evidence on the subject matter through a synergy of extant
   studies. The methodology used herein involves a combination of a
   systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis. The results of
   this study show that the digital transformation of the higher education
   sector is leading to the development of sustainable curriculums,
   digitalization of the higher education, enhancement of innovation, and
   an improvement in the performance of students. It also shows that the
   future of the digital transformation of the higher education sector will
   include-the advancement of the concept of `Education 4.0', an increase
   in gamification within the sector, a rise in the use of datafication in
   decision making, and the integration of artificial
   intelligence/augmented intelligence to reform higher education.},

Abstract = {Marston's load theory is commonly used for understanding the
   soil-conduit interaction. However, there are no practical methods
   available which can estimate the Marston's soil prism (MSP) width ratio.
   Moreover, the advent of soft computing methods has made many traditional
   approaches antiquated. The main purpose of this work is to compare and
   evaluate the predictive abilities of several machine learning-based
   models in predicting the MSP width ratio for the reinforced concrete
   (RC) and corrugated steel (CS) conduits. By utilizing the finite element
   modelling, a large-scale dataset was generated for the width of the soil
   prism for both types of conduit material, when buried under sandy soils
   of varying stiffness. After preparing the required dataset, feature
   validity technique based on correlation-based feature selection was
   employed to find the most influential parameters affecting the MSP
   width. Thereafter, five regression-based data driven models namely
   artificial neural networks (ANN), least-square support vector
   regression, extreme learning machine, Gaussian process regression, and
   multiple linear regression were developed to forecast the MSP width
   ratio. The results showed that the ANN outperforms the other predictive
   models for both the conduit types. In addition, due to the excellent
   overall performance of the ANN, it was translated into functional
   relationship for predicting the MSP width ratio for RC and CS conduits.},

Abstract = {Higher education is a source of skill acquisition for many middle- and
   high-skilled jobs. But what specific skills do universities impart on
   students to prepare them for desirable careers? In this study, we
   analyze a large novel corpora of over one million syllabi from over
   eight hundred bachelors' granting US educational institutions to connect
   material taught in higher education to the detailed work activities in
   the US economy as reported by the US Department of Labor. First, we show
   how differences in taught skills both within and between college majors
   correspond to earnings differences of recent graduates. Further, we use
   the co-occurrence of taught skills across all of academia to predict the
   skills that will be taught in a major moving forward. Our unified
   information system connecting workplace skills to the skills taught
   during higher education can improve the workforce development of
   high-skilled workers, inform educational programs of future trends, and
   enable employers to quantify the skills of potential workers.},

Abstract = {This study is a systematic review of 20 years of research on the usage
   of virtual reality (VR) in K-12 and higher education settings, which
   aims to consolidate, evaluate, and communicate evidence that can inform
   both the theory and practice of VR-based instruction. A total of 149
   articles were selected from three major academic databases using search
   strings and manual screening protocols. The literature analysis
   emphasized four interrelated aspects of VR-based instruction:
   instructional context, instructional design, technological affordances,
   and research findings. The results revealed evolving trends in the VR
   literature in terms of publication patterns, pedagogical assumptions,
   equipment usage, and research methodologies, as well as the contextual
   factors behind VR adoption in education. Additionally, a meta-analysis
   was conducted to examine the efficacy of VR-based instruction, with
   results indicating an overall medium effect and several moderating
   factors. Finally, practical implications and a future research agenda
   for VR-based instruction are discussed.},

Title = {Impact of an artificial intelligence deep-learning reconstruction
   algorithm for CT on image quality and potential dose reduction: A
   phantom study},

Abstract = {Background Recently, computed tomography (CT) manufacturers have
   developed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithms to compensate
   for the limitations of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms, such as
   image smoothing and the spatial resolution's dependence on contrast and
   dose levels. Purpose To assess the impact of an artificial intelligence
   deep-learning reconstruction (AI-DLR) algorithm on image quality and
   dose reduction compared with a hybrid IR algorithm in chest CT for
   different clinical indications. Methods Acquisitions on the CT American
   College of Radiology (ACR) 464 and CT Torso CTU-41 phantoms were
   performed at five dose levels (CTDIvol: 9.5/7.5/6/2.5/0.4 mGy) used for
   chest CT conditions. Raw data were reconstructed using filtered
   backprojection, two levels of IR (iDose(4) levels 4 (i4) and 7 (i7)),
   and five levels of AI-DLR (Precise Image; Smoother, Smooth, Standard,
   Sharp, Sharper). Noise power spectrum (NPS), task-based transfer
   function, and detectability index (d `) were computed: d `-modeled
   detection of a soft tissue mediastinal nodule (low-contrast soft tissue
   chest nodule within the mediastinum {[}LCN]), ground-glass opacity
   (GGO), or high-contrast pulmonary (HCP) lesion. The subjective image
   quality of chest anthropomorphic phantom images was independently
   evaluated by two radiologists. They assessed image noise, image
   smoothing, contrast between vessels and fat in the mediastinum for
   mediastinal images, visual border detection between bronchus and lung
   parenchyma for parenchymal images, and overall image quality using a
   commonly used four- or five-point scale. Results From Standard to
   Smoother levels, on average, the noise magnitude decreased (for all dose
   levels: -66.3\% +/- 0.5\% for mediastinal images and -63.1\% +/- 0.1\%
   for parenchymal images), the average NPS spatial frequency decreased
   (for all dose levels: -35.3\% +/- 2.2\% for mediastinal images and
   -13.3\% +/- 2.2\% for parenchymal images), and the detectability (d `)
   of the three lesions increased. The opposite pattern was found from
   Standard to Sharper levels. From Smoother to Sharper levels, the spatial
   resolution increased for the low-contrast polyethylene insert and the
   opposite for the high-contrast air insert. Compared to the i4 used in
   clinical practice, d ` values were higher using Smoother (mean for all
   dose levels: 338.7\% +/- 29.4\%), Smooth (103.4\% +/- 11.2\%), and
   Standard (34.1\% +/- 6.6\%) levels for the LCN on mediastinal images and
   Smoother (169.5\% +/- 53.2\% for GGO and 136.9\% +/- 1.6\% for HCP) and
   Smooth (36.4\% +/- 22.1\% and 24.1\% +/- 0.9\%, respectively) levels for
   parenchymal images. Radiologists considered the images satisfactory for
   clinical use at these levels, but adaptation to the dose level of the
   protocol is required. Conclusion With AI-DLR, the smoothest levels
   reduced the noise and improved the detectability of chest lesions but
   increased the image smoothing. The opposite was found with the sharpest
   levels. The choice of level depends on the dose level and type of image:
   mediastinal or parenchymal.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {137444-137459},
Abstract = {Several studies have shown that complex nonlinear learning analytics
   (LA) techniques outperform the traditional ones. However, the actual
   integration of these techniques in automatic LA systems remains rare
   because they are generally presumed to be opaque. At the same time, the
   current reviews on LA in higher education point out that LA should be
   more grounded to the learning science with actual linkage to teachers
   and pedagogical planning. In this study, we aim to address these two
   challenges. First, we discuss different techniques that open up the
   decision-making process of complex techniques and how they can be
   integrated in LA tools. More precisely, we present various global and
   local explainable techniques with an example of an automatic LA process
   that provides information about different resources that can support
   student agency in higher education institutes. Second, we exemplify
   these techniques and the LA process through recently collected student
   agency data in four courses of the same content taught by four different
   teachers. Altogether, we demonstrate how this process-which we call
   explainable student agency analytics-can contribute to teachers'
   pedagogical planning through the LA cycle.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, physical education teachers are constantly accepting and

   advantages of artificial intelligence big data AI technology, this paper
   designs a smart service platform for smart sports classrooms in
   colleges. The platform can timely find out the problems existing in the
   process of students' physical education so as to solve them in time.
   rough the comparison between the experimental class and the control
   class, it is verified that the platform improves the reliability of PE
   classroom teaching. Judging from the practice density of the 25PE
   classes observed, the highest practice density reached 57.5\%, and the
   average density was 41.6\%. During the interview, we learned that the
   practice density of most physical education teachers in each class is
   controlled at about 45\%, which is close to the average practice density
   obtained by the survey. is paper provides a practical basis for the
   reform of physical education teaching.},

Title = {Teaching Practice of Engineering Management Course for Engineering
   Education Certification under Background of Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {With the advancement of China's industrial construction, the field of
   engineering management has also attracted more attention. However,
   China's engineering management major is currently in a growing stage due
   to the issue of the opening years, and the teaching and practice setting
   of each course is also in an immature stage, which makes China's
   engineering management majors present more and more problems. The
   truancy rate has been increasing year by year, the students' dominant
   position in the class has become objectified, and their trust in
   teachers has decreased. Students' learning shows the characteristics of
   individualization and diversity. Higher requirements are put forward for
   teachers' teaching quality, and schools lack an effective supervision
   mechanism. In order to solve these problems better, it is imperative to
   reform and innovate the course teaching of engineering management
   majors. The core of engineering education accreditation is to confirm
   that engineering graduates meet established quality standards recognized
   by the industry. It is a unique method to test whether the course
   teaching of engineering management majors is qualified and attracts many
   scholars to discuss it. Engineering education accreditation has
   attracted many scholars to discuss it because it is a unique means to
   test the qualifications of engineering management students' course
   teaching. This study was based on an in-depth exploration of the
   teaching practice of engineering management courses and combines
   artificial intelligence with an engineering education certification.
   Through the research and analysis of colleges and universities, the
   research finally showed that the engineering management professional
   course teaching of engineering education certification under the
   background of artificial intelligence can promote the attendance of
   students in school by about 20\%. The achievement of course teaching
   objectives has increased by about 13\% and the comprehensive ability
   level of graduates has increased by about 8\%. It improved the overall
   level of students and the teaching quality and efficiency of engineering
   management courses and also promoted the development of college
   education so that today's engineering management graduates can better
   meet the needs of today's society.},

Title = {Estimation of density and compressibility factor of natural gas using
   artificial intelligence approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {201-216},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Natural gas density is commonly measured by Coriolis density meters and
   gas chromatographs, both of which are used to calculate the natural gas
   mass flow rate. In this study, two networks are proposed to predict the
   density and compressibility factor of natural gas. The first network
   (N-1) uses temperature, pressure and Joule Thomson (JT) coefficient of
   natural gas as input variables and density of natural gas is selected to
   be the target. This network is proposed to predict the natural gas
   density at natural gas pressure drop stations (CGSs). For this network,
   the gas mixture compositions are unnecessary. The second network (N-2)
   is proposed based on the pseudo reduced temperature and pressure as
   input variables that the network by using these two variables can
   predict the density and compressibility factor of natural gas. This
   model needs the gas mixture compositions. For these targets, a novel
   idea based on artificial intelligence is used. Five models of artificial
   intelligence are implemented that are fuzzy inference system (FIS),
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), ANFIS optimized with
   genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), multilayer feed-forward neural network
   (MLFFNN) and group method of data handling (GMDH). The results
   demonstrated that the ANFIS-GA and GMDH model performed better than the
   FIS, MLFFNN and ANFIS models. For N-1, root mean square error (RMSE) for
   ANFIS-GA and GMDH models were obtained as 0.2405 and 0.2042 (kg/m(3)),
   respectively. For N-2 (compressibility factor), the value of RMSE for
   ANFIS-GA and GMDH models consecutively was achieved 0.0061 and 0.0054.
   Also, for N-2 (density), RMSE for ANFIS-GA and GMDH models was taken
   2.2735 and 2.6113, respectively. These values of RMSE were reported for
   the testing phase of the models.},

Title = {Using artificial intelligence for global solar radiation modeling from
   meteorological variables},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {215},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Long-term quantification of solar energy variables at ground level is
   not easily achievable in many locations. In order to overcome this
   limitation, use of artificial intelligence such as the application of
   machine learning methods is commonly used for solar irradiance
   prediction.
   In this context, this study proposes the implementation of artificial
   neural networks as deep learning and the XGBoost algorithm as a machine
   learning method for modeling the hourly global solar radiation for a
   humid climate such as the Rabat region. For this purpose, hourly
   meteorological data from the city of Rabat in Morocco are chosen in
   order of importance using the random forests method, for training and
   testing the models, namely date and time, sunshine duration,
   temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction and pressure.
   Subsequently, models are selected after the validation phase for
   testing, whose performance is evaluated using relevant statistical
   indicators. As a result, we retain 2 ANN and 1 XGBoost models which are
   eventually very close in terms of performance with a coefficient of
   determination value equal to 98\% and 97\% respectively. However,
   statistical indicators have proven to be effective in assessing the
   accuracy and fidelity of each model.
   Ultimately, the intent of the modeling in terms of accuracy, simplicity
   or fidelity is a crucial factor in the selection of the model algorithm
   to adopt.},

Journal = {RARE METALS},

Month = {2023 AUG 28},
Abstract = {Redox-active organic materials are emerging as the new playground for
   the design of new exciting battery materials for rechargeable batteries
   because of the merits including structural diversity and tunable
   electrochemical properties that are not easily accessible for the
   inorganic counterparts. More importantly, the sustainability developed
   by using naturally abundant chemical elements (C, H, N, O and S) makes
   them as an ideal alternative material for Li-ion batteries (LIBs).
   However, the identification and screening of proper organic materials is
   still challenging in the past decades. Assisted by the artificial
   intelligence, this review will give a summary of the theoretical design
   aspects of redox-active organic materials from density-functional theory
   (DFT) to machine learning (ML) methods in the past two decades, with a
   particular emphasis on the calculation method to predict the
   chemical/electrochemical stability and reversibility. This review will
   also analyze and discuss the challenges and perspectives for the
   development of organic battery materials.},

Abstract = {Effective inclusive education is key in promoting the long-term outcomes
   of children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, no concrete
   consensus exists to guide teacher-student interactions in the classroom.
   In this work, we explore the potential of artificial intelligence as an
   approach in autism education to assist teachers in effective practice in
   developing social and educational outcomes for children with ASC. We
   form a protocol to systematically capture such interactions, and conduct
   a statistical analysis to uncover basic patterns in the collected
   observations, including the longer-term effect of specific teacher
   communication strategies on student response. In addition, we deploy
   machine learning techniques to predict student response given the form
   of communication used by teachers under specific classroom conditions
   and in relation to specified student attributes. Our analysis, drawn on
   a sample of 5460 coded interactions between teachers and seven students,
   sheds light on the varying effectiveness of different communication
   strategies and demonstrates the potential of this approach in making a
   contribution to autism education.},

Abstract = {Game-based learning in schools and colleges, with the help of AI-enabled
   augmented intelligence techniques, is reported to improve children's
   neurodevelopment, intellectual sensing, and specific learning abilities,
   according to US officials. There is currently a huge transformation from
   traditional assisted learning to augmented reality-enabled
   computer-based learning. Globally, there has been a dramatic increase in
   the use of game-based augmented learning in most schools and colleges. A
   few problems arise that create concern, such as the emerging effects of
   gaming on institutional premises, the disordering of children's
   involvement after game-learning, the rate of learning and attendance,
   adaptation, and teachers' experience. To address these individual
   aspects, we proposed a blockchain Ethereum-enabled, secure AI-based
   augmented game learning environment, called B-AIQoE, in which protected
   on-chain and off-chain channels are designed to handle all the
   transactions and exchanges among students before analysis in terms of
   color transition, redundancy, unethical transmission, and related
   vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the proposed system examines and
   analyzes the Quality of experience (QoE) and improves accessibility as
   it receives feedback from the students and teachers. For the purpose of
   automating game-based transactions, three different aspects are
   discussed, such as verifying and validating student-teacher
   registration, creating content for game-based learning and privacy, and
   updating students' records and exchanges. Finally, this paper separates,
   analyzes, and discusses a list of emerging challenges and limitations
   and their possible solutions involved in creating the proposed system.},

Title = {The Indoor Space Layout of University Laboratories Based on Wireless
   Communication and Artificial Intelligence Decision-Making},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {In recent years, people have found that the use of contactless wireless
   communication can be more quickly interactive information transmission,
   which greatly facilitates our daily life. However, in the past, wireless
   communication is generally large-scale regional information
   dissemination. In recent years, with the further development of closed
   scenes, people are thinking about whether wireless communication can be
   used in closed scenes to do small and fast information transmission. The
   purpose of this paper is to study the indoor space layout of university
   laboratories based on wireless communication and artificial intelligence
   decision-making support. We are looking at the information about
   wireless communication to learn that wireless communication was often
   used in military transmission of signals and information; it has been
   vigorously developed and popularized, is now mainly used for civilian
   use, and can be combined with artificial intelligence to implement rapid
   information transmission transfer, in the data processing volume at a
   certain time basically achieving second transmission. Wireless
   communication and artificial intelligence decision-making can be used to
   conduct research on the indoor layout of college laboratories. In
   response, after data query and data comparison, we applied to the school
   for a computer lab and several idle laboratories to cooperate in
   experiments to facilitate the completion of the architecture of wireless
   communication and artificial intelligence systems, as well as subsequent
   data processing analysis. After a period of time of experiments,
   according to the results of the experiment, the use of wireless
   communication and artificial intelligence decision-making can help
   college laboratories according to their own functions, the installation
   of intelligent equipment, and the indoor layout of better arrangements.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the various factors influencing students in
   adopting e-learning in educational institutions in Saudi Arabia ,
   analyze the relationship between factors of students' adoption of
   e-learning and student behavior intention. The study also analyzes
   perceived opportunities and challenges faced by students in adopting an
   e-learning system in higher education. A well-structured questionnaire
   was developed , information was collected from 509 respondents. The
   study found that students' behavioral intention to adopt e-learning is
   highly influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social
   influence, facilitating conditions, computer self-efficacy, and internet
   knowledge. The study confirms the mediating role of student engagement
   that can act as an alternate path for strengthening the relationship
   between factors of adoption of e-learning and behavioral intention. In
   addition, several implications and new lines of investigation are
   recommended for meeting the educational transformation needs and future

Abstract = {The allocation of office space in any large institution is usually a
   problematical issue, which often demands a substantial amount of time to
   perform manually. The result of this allocation affects the lives of
   whoever makes use of the space. In the higher education sector in the
   UK, space is becoming an increasingly precious commodity. Student
   numbers have risen significantly over the last few years and as a
   result, university departments have grown in size. In addition,
   universities have come under increasing financial pressure to ensure
   that space is utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible.
   However, space utilization is only one issue to take into account when
   measuring whether or not a particular allocation is of a sufficient high
   quality. The problem of space allocation is further complicated by the
   fact that no standard procedure is practiced throughout the higher
   education sector. Most institutions have their own standards and
   requirements, which are often very different to other institutions.
   Different levels of authority control the domains of rooms and resources
   in different institutions. The most common situation is where a central
   university office controls a number of faculties, each managing a number
   of departments. This paper will focus specifically on applying
   optimization methods to departmental room allocation for non-residential
   space in the higher education sector. It will look at the use of three
   methods (hill-climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) to
   automatically generate solutions to the problem. The processing power of
   computers and the repetitive search nature of this problem means that
   there is great potential for the automation of this process. The paper
   will conclude by discussing and comparing these methods and showing how
   they cope with a highly constrained problem.},

Abstract = {To explore the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in
   the field of teacher teaching evaluation, the machine learning algorithm
   is proposed to construct a teaching evaluation model, which is suitable
   for the current educational model, and can help colleges and
   universities to improve the existing problems in teaching. Firstly, the
   existing problems in the current teaching evaluation system are put
   forward and a novel teaching evaluation model is designed. Then, the
   relevant theories and techniques required to build the model are
   introduced. Finally, the experiment methods and process are carried out
   to find out the appropriate machine learning algorithm and optimize the
   obtained weighted naive Bayes (WNB) algorithm, which is compared with
   traditional naive Bayes (NB) algorithm and back propagation (BP)
   algorithm. The results reveal that compared with NB algorithm, the
   average classification accuracy of WNB algorithm is 0.817, while that of
   NB algorithm is 0.751. Compared with BP algorithm, WNB algorithm has a
   classification accuracy of 0.800, while that of BP algorithm is 0.680.
   Therefore, it is proved that WNB algorithm has favorable effect in
   teaching evaluation model.},

Title = {Multi-Target PIR Indoor Localization and Tracking System with Artificial
   Intelligence},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pyroelectric infrared (PIR) sensors are low-cost, low-power, and highly
   reliable sensors that have been widely used in smart environments.
   Indoor localization systems may be wearable or non-wearable, where the
   latter are also known as device-free localization systems. Since binary
   PIR sensors detect only the presence of a subject's motion in their
   field of view (FOV) without other information about the actual location,
   information from overlapping FOVs of multiple sensors can be useful for
   localization. This study introduces the PIRILS (pyroelectric infrared
   indoor localization system), in which the sensing signal processing
   algorithms are augmented by deep learning algorithms that are designed
   based on the operational characteristics of the PIR sensor. Expanding to
   the detection of multiple targets, the PIRILS develops a quantized
   scheme that exploits the behavior of an artificial neural network (ANN)
   model to demonstrate localization performance in tracking multiple
   targets. To further improve the localization performance, the PIRILS
   incorporates a data augmentation strategy that enhances the training
   data diversity of the target's motion. Experimental results indicate
   system stability, improved positioning accuracy, and expanded
   applicability, thus providing an improved indoor multi-target
   localization framework.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Primary or secondary music directors, college or collaborative music
   directors, and music educators are trained in music education. Students
   in music education research and develop new methods for teaching and
   learning music. Through peer-reviewed publications and instruction at
   the University of Music for music teachers, students in the field of
   music conduct their research. Using artificial intelligence in the
   classroom is a challenge because music is an available domain that
   requires students and teachers to innovate and solve problems. In this
   paper, Music Education and Teaching based on AI (MET-AI) techniques are
   increasingly comprehensive with modern science and technology, enhancing
   music education. The use of artificial intelligence in music education
   breached the conventional paradigm of music education, particularly
   electronic music and innovative music software in private colleges,
   which has significantly enhanced the standard of teaching music and the
   teaching model for music education. The experimental results show us
   that the network teaching platform Music Major should be continuously
   improved based on artificial intelligence technologies. AI can make more
   optimized environments and professional music classes so that teachers
   and students can make the most of this and ensure smooth improvement in
   the network's teaching model. The MET-AI scores students' learning
   outcome rate of 95.2\%, an efficiency ratio of 98.1\%, the mean square
   error rate of 17.9\%, accuracy ratio of 95.3\%, teaching performance
   analysis ratio of 90.7\%, the false-positive rate of 18.6\%, true
   positive rate 95.7\% and flexibility ratio of 92,1\%.},

Abstract = {This study provided a content analysis of studies aiming to disclose how
   artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to the education sector
   and explore the potential research trends and challenges of AI in
   education. A total of 100 papers including 63 empirical papers (74
   studies) and 37 analytic papers were selected from the education and
   educational research category of Social Sciences Citation Index database
   from 2010 to 2020. The content analysis showed that the research
   questions could be classified into development layer (classification,
   matching, recommendation, and deep learning), application layer
   (feedback, reasoning, and adaptive learning), and integration layer
   (affection computing, role-playing, immersive learning, and
   gamification). Moreover, four research trends, including Internet of
   Things, swarm intelligence, deep learning, and neuroscience, as well as
   an assessment of AI in education, were suggested for further
   investigation. However, we also proposed the challenges in education may
   be caused by AI with regard to inappropriate use of AI techniques,
   changing roles of teachers and students, as well as social and ethical
   issues. The results provide insights into an overview of the AI used for

Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {As the demand for education continues to increase, the relative lack of
   physical resources has become a bottleneck hindering the development of
   school physical education to a certain extent. This research mainly
   discusses the evaluation index system of school sports resources based
   on artificial intelligence and edge computing. Human resources,
   financial resources, and material resources in school sports resources
   are the three major resources in resource science. University sports
   stadium information publicity uses Internet technology to establish a
   sports information management platform and mobile Internet terminals to
   optimize university sports resources and stadium information management
   services. It uses artificial intelligence technology to improve venue
   information management. It establishes a comprehensive platform for
   venue management information, collects multidimensional information,
   provides information resources and accurate information push, and links
   venue information with public fitness needs. Using edge computing to
   realize nearby cloud processing of video data, reduce the phenomenon of
   black screen jams during live broadcast, improve data computing
   capabilities, and reduce users' dependence on the performance of
   terminal devices, build a smart sports resource platform, combine
   artificial intelligence (AI) to create smart communities, smart venues,
   and realize intelligent operations such as event service operations and
   safety prevention and control in important event venues. During the live
   broadcast of the student sports league, the nearby cloud processing of
   video data is realized in the form of edge computing, which improves the
   data computing ability and reduces the performance dependence on the
   user terminal equipment itself. In the academic survey of college
   physical education teachers, undergraduates accounted for 26.99\%,
   masters accounted for 60.3\%, and doctoral degrees accounted for 12.8\%.
   This research will help the reasonable allocation of school sports
   resources.},

Abstract = {College English teaching includes five aspects, which are cultivating
   students' English listening ability, speaking ability, reading ability,
   reading ability, and reading ability. These five aspects complement each

   translation can cultivate students' Chinese ability and English ability
   at the same time. The college stage is an important turning stage on the
   way of students' learning and growth. During this period, the main
   teaching goal of teachers is not to help students take exams, but more
   importantly, students could adapt to the society. Under the background
   of artificial intelligence, teachers need to find new and effective
   teaching concepts to improve the practical effect of translation
   teaching, which has attracted the attention and attention of college
   teachers in recent years. Correct use of artificial intelligence in

Title = {Statistical modelling of the impact of online courses in higher

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2, SI},
Pages = {404-425},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Purpose The concept of sustainable development (SD) is a popular
   response to society's need to preserve and extend the life span of
   natural resources. One of the 17 goals of the SD is ``education
   quality{''} (Fourth Goal of Sustainable Development {[}SDG-4]).
   Education quality is an important goal because education is a powerful
   force that can influence social policies and social change. The SDG-4
   must be measured in different contexts, and the tools to quantify its
   effects require exploration. So, this study aims to propose a
   statistical model to measure the impact of higher education online
   courses on SD and a structural equation model (SEM) to find constructs
   or factors that help us explain a sustainability benefits rate. These
   proposed models integrate the three areas of sustainability: social,
   economic and environmental. Design/methodology/approach A beta
   regression model suggests features that include the academic and
   economic opportunities offered by the institution, the involvement in
   research activities and the quality of the online courses. A structural
   equation modelling (SEM) analysis allowed selecting the key variables
   and constructs that are strongly linked to the SD. Findings One of the
   key findings showed that the benefit provided by online courses in terms
   of SD is 62.99\% higher than that of offline courses in aspects such as
   transportation, photocopies, printouts, books, food, clothing, enrolment
   fees and connectivity. Research limitations/implications The SEM model
   needs large sample sizes to have consistent estimations. Thus, despite
   the obtained estimations in the proposed SEM model being reliable, the
   authors consider that a limitation of this study was the required time
   to collect data corresponding to the estimated sample size.
   Originality/value This study proposes two novel and different ways to
   estimate the sustainability benefits rate focused on SDG-4, and machine
   learning tools are implemented to validate and gain robustness in the
   estimations of the beta model. Additionally, the SEM model allows us to
   identify new constructs associated with SDG-4.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy in early childhood education: an
   intervention study in Hong Kong},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 1},
Abstract = {The issue of Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy is gaining popularity
   in the field of education. Most research on AI literacy has focused on
   primary, secondary, and higher education, and there has been limited
   examination of AI literacy programs in early childhood education. This
   study aimed to evaluate the impact of an eight-week AI literacy program
   on young children's AI literacy, AI-related creativity, and their
   perceptions of the AI4KG program. A total of 26 young children (average
   age of 4 years) enrolled in the program at a kindergarten in Hong Kong
   were the subjects of the study. The results indicated that (1) young
   children were capable of learning basic AI concepts and knowledge; (2)
   in terms of AI-related creativity, younger children were able to design
   a chatting robot via imagination, while older children created an AI
   robot to assist people in their drawings; (3) in regards to the
   children's perceptions of the AI4KG program, older children who enjoyed
   the activity were able to train AI, while younger children preferred to

Title = {Machine learning and artificial intelligence research for patient
   benefit: 20 critical questions on transparency, replicability, ethics,
   and effectiveness},
Journal = {BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other modern statistical
   methods are providing new opportunities to operationalise previously
   untapped and rapidly growing sources of data for patient benefit.
   Despite much promising research currently being undertaken, particularly
   in imaging, the literature as a whole lacks transparency, clear
   reporting to facilitate replicability, exploration for potential ethical
   concerns, and clear demonstrations of effectiveness. Among the many
   reasons why these problems exist, one of the most important (for which
   we provide a preliminary solution here) is the current lack of best
   practice guidance specific to machine learning and artificial
   intelligence. However, we believe that interdisciplinary groups pursuing
   research and impact projects involving machine learning and artificial
   intelligence for health would benefit from explicitly addressing a
   series of questions concerning transparency, reproducibility, ethics,
   and effectiveness (TREE). The 20 critical questions proposed here
   provide a framework for research groups to inform the design, conduct,
   and reporting; for editors and peer reviewers to evaluate contributions
   to the literature; and for patients, clinicians and policy makers to
   critically appraise where new findings may deliver patient benefit.},

Abstract = {Ideological and political education plays an important role in
   supporting social talent input. However, the current evaluation effect
   of ideological and political education is difficult to quantify.
   Therefore, in order to improve the evaluation effect of ideological and
   political education, based on artificial intelligence algorithms, this
   study combines machine learning ideas and the current status of
   ideological and political education to build a fuzzy analytic hierarchy
   process model of the of ideological and political teaching quality based
   on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Moreover, this study
   uses a three-tier structure to build a model network structure, and
   based on the characteristics of fuzzy evaluation, this study uses the
   expert system to conduct data management, operation and control of model
   evaluation, and build a corresponding database to update the data in
   real time. In addition, in order to verify the effect of the model, this
   study sets simulation experiments to analyze the model performance. From
   the point of view of running effect and running speed, this research
   model meets the actual needs of the system, so it can be applied to the
   evaluation process of ideological and political teaching quality in
   colleges and universities.},

Journal = {APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The phenomenon of economic globalization has led to a greater
   intermingling of economy and culture, which has brought about new
   demands for innovative talent cultivation in universities. To meet these
   demands, universities need to cultivate more students with high language
   ability who are capable of communicating and exchanging ideas between
   different cultures. This requires universities to innovate their
   language cultivation programs and improve students' language ability and
   cultural literacy. The cultivation of international language ability,
   particularly in English language and literature, plays a vital role in
   enhancing students' comprehensive language literacy. However,
   traditional teaching methods have been found to be less effective in
   achieving desired learning outcomes. As such, there is a need to adopt
   more innovative teaching methods that stimulate students' interest in
   learning and facilitate their experience of English language and
   literature in authentic cultural contexts. One promising approach to
   achieve these objectives is through the integration of smart classroom
   teaching and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This approach
   offers a range of benefits, including personalized learning experiences,
   real-time feedback, and interactive engagement. Furthermore, the
   application of AI technology can assist teachers in guiding students to
   experience the cultural background of English language and literature in
   English situations, helping students to exercise their English language
   application skills. This paper proposes a method and application
   assessment for designing a smart classroom for English language and
   literature based on AI technology. The primary aim of this approach is
   to help students become familiar with the English context and cultural
   background, thereby improving their overall language proficiency. The
   proposed approach seeks to facilitate a more engaging and effective
   learning experience for students, allowing them to develop their
   language skills and cultural literacy in a meaningful and impactful way.},

Abstract = {In this work, we studied a Ti-Nb-Zr-Sn system for exploring novel
   composition and temperatures that will be helpful in maximizing the
   stability of beta phase while minimizing the formation of alpha{''} and
   omega-phase. The Ti-Nb-Zr-Sn system is free of toxic elements. This
   system was studied under the framework of CALculation of PHAse Diagram
   (CALPHAD) approach for determining the stability of various phases.
   These data were analyzed through artificial intelligence (AI)
   algorithms. Deep learning artificial neural network (DLANN) models were
   developed for various phases as a function of alloy composition and
   temperature. Software was written in Python programming language and
   DLANN models were developed utilizing TensorFlow/Keras libraries. DLANN
   models were used to predict various phases for new compositions and
   temperatures and provided a more complete dataset. This dataset was
   further analyzed through the concept of self-organizing maps (SOM) for
   determining correlations between phase stability of various phases,
   chemical composition, and temperature. Through this study, we determined
   candidate alloy compositions and temperatures that will be helpful in
   avoiding/minimizing formation of alpha{''} and omega-phase in a
   Ti-Zr-Nb-Sn system. This approach can be utilized in other systems such
   as omega-free shape memory alloys. DLANN models can even be used on a
   common Android mobile phone.},

Abstract = {With the development of computer science and technology, online
   education is gradually accepted by more and more users, and has become
   one of the main teaching methods in schools under the influence of the
   epidemic in recent years. In addition, online vocational education or
   higher education has also captured the psychology of national learning,
   and online tutoring has gradually entered into nonstudent groups such as
   office workers. Although online education has the advantages of low cost
   and no limitation of time and space, it also has some problems, such as
   low classroom satisfaction, delayed feedback from students, and poor
   teaching effect. Therefore, this paper aims at this problem by combining
   the development background of foreign intelligent answer system and
   self-test system, and introducing it into our computer application,
   using artificial intelligence for natural language processing, aiming at
   online teaching students cannot get timely answer, and self-test
   questions intelligent system design. The final experimental results show
   that the system effectively alleviates the problems of students' delay
   in answering questions and poor self-test effect, and increases the
   satisfaction of online classroom by 13\%.},

Abstract = {Statistical quality control - SQC (consisting of Statistical Process
   Control, Process Capability Studies, Acceptance Sampling and Design of
   Experiments) is a very important tool to obtain, maintain and improve
   the Quality level of goods and services produced by an organization.
   Despite its importance, and the fact that it is taught in technical and
   college courses, as well as in companies' training sectors, SQC has been
   largely misused. An inappropriate teaching approach may be the cause of
   such problem; therefore it has motivated the development of a model for
   SQC teaching, allowing its learners to correctly apply SQC techniques.
   After a survey regarding the concept needed to correctly apply SQC, its
   use and teaching/training methods, the model's contents and methodology
   were defined. We also realized the opportunity of incorporating a
   computer environment for the model, permitting the practice of the
   needed SQC concepts and skills. An Artificial Intelligence approach was
   used to develop the computer environment, resulting in an Intelligent
   Tutoring System, the STCEQ. The paper discusses the main characteristics
   of the system, its functioning, benefits of using such a system and the
   results we obtained while using this system. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Artificial Intelligence for Securing IoT Services in Edge Computing: A
   Survey},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {With the explosive growth of data generated by the Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices, the traditional cloud computing model by transferring all
   data to the cloud for processing has gradually failed to meet the
   real-time requirement of IoT services due to high network latency. Edge
   computing (EC) as a new computing paradigm shifts the data processing
   from the cloud to the edge nodes (ENs), greatly improving the Quality of
   Service (QoS) for those IoT applications with low-latency requirements.
   However, compared to other endpoint devices such as smartphones or
   computers, distributed ENs are more vulnerable to attacks for restricted
   computing resources and storage. In the context that security and
   privacy preservation have become urgent issues for EC, great progress in
   artificial intelligence (AI) opens many possible windows to address the
   security challenges. The powerful learning ability of AI enables the
   system to identify malicious attacks more accurately and efficiently.
   Meanwhile, to a certain extent, transferring model parameters instead of
   raw data avoids privacy leakage. In this paper, a comprehensive survey
   of the contribution of AI to the IoT security in EC is presented. First,
   the research status and some basic definitions are introduced. Next, the
   IoT service framework with EC is discussed. The survey of privacy
   preservation and blockchain for edge-enabled IoT services with AI is
   then presented. In the end, the open issues and challenges on the
   application of AI in IoT services based on EC are discussed.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms have achieved
   ambitious aims through automated image pattern recognition. For
   neurological disorders, this includes neurodegeneration and
   inflammation. Scalable imaging technology for big data in neurology is
   optical coherence tomography (OCT). We highlight that OCT changes
   observed in the retina, as a window to the brain, are small, requiring
   rigorous quality control pipelines. There are existing tools for this
   purpose. Firstly, there are human-led validated consensus quality
   control criteria (OSCAR-IB) for OCT. Secondly, these criteria are
   embedded into OCT reporting guidelines (APOSTEL). The use of the
   described annotation of failed OCT scans advances machine learning. This
   is illustrated through the present review of the advantages and
   disadvantages of AI-based applications to OCT data. The neurological
   conditions reviewed here for the use of big data include Alzheimer
   disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease, and
   epilepsy. It is noted that while big data is relevant for AI, ownership
   is complex. For this reason, we also reached out to involve
   representatives from patient organizations and the public domain in
   addition to clinical and research centers. The evidence reviewed can be
   grouped in a five-point expansion of the OSCAR-IB criteria to embrace AI
   (OSCAR-AI). The review concludes by specific recommendations on how this
   can be achieved practically and in compliance with existing guidelines.},

Title = {E-learning in higher education during COVID-19: evidence from blackboard
   learning system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1603-1622},
Month = {DEC 6},
Abstract = {Purpose - The blackboard learning system is an online platform designed
   for e-learning employed by higher education institutes like universities
   that facilities students to continue learning and educational
   activities. This study explores the determinants that affect students'
   acceptance and use of Blackboard learning system (BLS) in Pakistan
   utilizing the modified UTAUT framework with social isolation as an
   additional variable.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted, and
   the study gathered 494 university students' responses in Pakistan as
   participants. The collected data were interpreted applying PLS-SEM
   version 3.2.3 software.
   Findings - The study's findings exhibited that PE, EE, FC and SI are the
   prime determinants influencing the intention and use of BLS in Pakistani
   universities. Hedonic motivation and social isolation interact
   differently between UTAUT variables and use intention. The results
   verify the suitability of the applied theory in the background of the
   study.
   Research limitations/implications - However, the findings highlight the
   present understanding of BLS use from the learners' aspect, but the
   study's limitation cannot be evaded. The study respondents belonged to a
   specific region of Pakistan (Karachi) that might influence the
   usefulness of the outcomes. Other factors categorized as the
   environmental, system and organizational elements were not part of the
   study that may also differentiate the BLS acceptance. The model was
   extended by including the social isolation, but the effect is
   insignificant yet positive; therefore, it is required to evaluate the
   model differently, such as the organizational aspect, for future
   research. Moreover, the ethnic factors that vary in emerging and
   developed economies may provide different explanations; therefore, they
   can be incorporated in future studies. Likewise, the variables such as
   hedonic motivation need to be emphasized more by examining and
   evaluating its effect on students' education performance in the future.
   Practical implications - The outcome of the study suggests some
   implications. At first, being the modified framework UTAUT2 application
   makes the collaboration appropriate according to the current phenomena
   of the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to the higher education
   region to analyze the acceptance of e-learning systems. Educational
   institutions within Pakistan would emphasize enhancing students'
   accomplishment by improving the interface and the blackboard learning
   system workability. Hence, learners' effectiveness in learning would be
   escalated; they would be encouraged to accomplish study objectives using
   BLS, particularly when they consider it easy to use and a useful
   platform for e-learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, enhancing the
   e-learning system in the context of the effort demands to be required to
   utilize BLS should be the foremost objective as learners would be
   motivated to accept the technology if they consider it simple,
   convenient, and user-friendly to adopt. Thus, the benefits of using BLS
   during this situation when universities are not operational will make
   students adaptable to change in the prospect. Learners will accept the
   model of online education, even if the universities become operational.
   However, it can increase the rate of earnings and revenue for
   universities as they can enroll in online and regular classes.
   Therefore, it is suggested that higher education management should
   create a resilient online platform by which facilitators can communicate
   with learners without any obstacles.
   Social implications - Hence, it is recommended to introduce the online
   short course, qualification, certified courses and integrated coursework
   with international ventures and ongoing classes. Numerous learners
   continue their studies along with the job. Therefore, it is suggested to
   introduce online programs for those learners. Another benefit would be
   that it offers an integrated platform for sharing knowledge. BLS offers
   to maintain the complete information in one place, and learners can see
   them as per their convenience based on their availability. This reduces
   the burden on administration related to keeping the educational material
   and resource in various files. Thus, it also reduces the expense of
   universities. It is suggested to emphasize encouraging the use of BLS
   through an effective plan that can assist in execution and help learners
   identify the technology features rather than to face difficultly to
   accept the change. Moreover, the acceptance of BLS for educational
   purposes verifies that other learning events can occur on the online
   platform. Thus, it is recommended to promote the origin of the online
   atmosphere and the initiation of other events. Globally, dynamics are
   changing frequently and continuously and are moving towards artificial
   intelligence systems; the circumstances are suitable for promoting
   online educational platforms' acceptance by incorporating it with the
   current educational arrangement.
   Originality/value - The study provides recommendations for the research
   to be conducted to explore the modified framework in different regions
   and boundaries to evaluate the effect of other factors on adopting
   e-learning platforms.},

Abstract = {Through co-occurrence analysis of 1139 documents (1964-2018) we
   identified discussions about the implementation of student teaching
   evaluation (SET). We found that: (1) Attention to SET originated in the
   US in the 1970s, spreading to German-speaking countries in the mid-1990s
   and continuing in China and Latin America in the early 2000s. (2) SET is
   commonly viewed as a control tool deserving methodological improvement,
   while bias is debated in the US. We also found local trajectories: (3)
   Whereas in the US and Latin America SET is primarily seen as a
   management tool, German-speaking and Chinese authors reflect more on
   improving teaching. Chinese scholars consider SET a valid instrument for
   state control associated with artificial intelligence. Also, (4) SET is
   commonly used in medical education in the US and the German-speaking
   region and in physical education in China. We conclude that SET is
   discussed cross-nationally but affected by regional path dependencies.},

Abstract = {The digitization of thought theory is not yet sufficient to meet the
   needs of the students. It is very necessary to strengthen the
   construction of ideological and political (IP) courses, strengthen the
   education of mainstream ideology, and occupy the initiative of
   discourse. There are effective ways and means to study the deep
   integration of information technologies into the new age of philosophy
   and philosophy education of students, which can greatly improve the
   quality of teaching and the effectiveness of humanities courses. The
   intuitive development of intellectual and political education through
   artificial intelligence is both a real prerequisite for modern
   development and technological innovation and for new ideas confronting
   the specific problems of thought-politics education, and it is a
   necessary prerequisite to ensure the quality and efficiency to improve
   the teaching of thought politics. AI in ways that embed technology
   provides a powerful impetus for contradictory movements in
   thought-politics discourse that lead the effective coordination of its
   internal elements to high-quality developments. In a practical way, we
   should take full advantage of the technical advantages of artificial
   intelligence, through intelligent mehrfachanalyse corresponding
   algorithms, artificial intelligenzbilder, and artificial roboterbilder
   photos and profiles that are used to write and accurately provide more
   precise, leading, stacking, and accurate estimates to maximize and to
   improve the accuracy of thought and policy education. Philosophy and
   political theory are the keys to guiding people to accomplish basic
   human tasks. With the passage of time and with continuous innovation,
   ideology and philosophical principles are both prerequisites for the
   self-development of the emotions of the age and necessary for improving
   the outcomes and effectiveness of scientific education. Advances in the
   field of artificial intelligence have fundamentally changed human life
   and have also impacted traditional school and university education
   systems. This brings new opportunities and challenges to students. This
   includes the use of smart technology to improve the learning process.
   Ideological teachers and policymakers must keep up with the all-round
   trend of the times, make full use of the benefits brought by intelligent
   new technologies and platforms, effectively improve the effect of
   ideological education, and further increase the attractiveness,
   attraction, persuasion, and contagion of ideological education.},

Abstract = {To improve the word order ranking effect of English language retrieval,
   based on machine learning algorithms, this paper combines a semionline
   model to construct an artificial intelligence ranking model for English

   ELM regression model. Moreover, this paper derives the mathematical
   model of semisupervised ELM in detail and uses FCM clustering to screen
   credible samples, ELM collaborative training to mark each other's
   samples, and the marked samples to calculate the output weights of
   semisupervised ELM regression. In addition, based on continuous learning
   of OSELMR, this paper uses confidence evaluation to screen out credible
   unlabeled samples, OSELM collaborative training to mark the credible
   samples with each other, and credible unlabeled samples to calculate the
   output weight of SSOSELMR. Finally, this paper designs a control
   experiment to analyze the model algorithm, compares and counts the
   parameters, and draws a statistical graph. The research results show
   that the model constructed in this paper is effective.},

Abstract = {Digital data are transforming higher education (HE) to be more
   student-focused and metrics-centred. In the UK, capturing detailed data
   about students has become a government priority, with an emphasis on
   using student data to measure, compare and assess university
   performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the governmental
   and commercial drivers of current large-scale technological efforts to
   collect and analyse student data in UK HE. The result is an expanding
   data infrastructure which includes large-scale and longitudinal
   datasets, learning analytics services, student apps, data dashboards and
   digital learning platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI).
   Education data scientists have built positive pedagogic cases for
   student data analysis, learning analytics and AI. The politicization and
   commercialization of the wider HE data infrastructure is translating
   them into performance metrics in an increasingly market-driven sector,
   raising the need for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically
   valuable uses of student data in HE. Practitioner Notes What is already
   known about this topic Learning analytics, education data science and
   artificial intelligence are opening up new ways of collecting and
   analysing student data in higher education. UK government policies
   emphasize the use of student data for improvements to teaching and
   learning. What this paper adds A conceptual framework from
   ``infrastructure studies{''} demonstrates how political objectives and
   commercial aims are fused to HE data systems, with data infrastructure
   becoming a key tool of government reform. A critical infrastructure
   analysis shows that student data processing technologies are being
   developed and deployed to measure university performance through student
   data. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and managers in
   universities need to prepare robust institutional frameworks to govern
   their use of student data. Learning analytics practitioners, data
   scientists, learning scientists and social science researchers need to
   collaborate with the policy community and education technology
   developers on new policy frameworks to challenge narrow uses of student
   data as performance metrics.},

Abstract = {Opportunities and difficulties have arisen for the educational system as
   a result of the development of ``artificial intelligence{''} technology.
   In the era of ``artificial intelligence{''}, the main features of
   ideological and political education in colleges are the development of
   the intelligence revolution, the development of teaching concepts, and
   the omnipotence of teaching content, and teaching methods. This study
   further explores the necessity and development of ``artificial
   intelligence technology{''} in college ideological and political
   education through a questionnaire survey, and promotes the organic
   integration of artificial intelligence and ideological and political
   education. The results show that {[}1] College students have positive
   attitudes toward the application of artificial intelligence in college
   ideological and political education, and college students are looking
   forward to the intelligent services and changes brought by artificial
   intelligence technology in college ideological and political education
   {[}2]. According to the results of the questionnaire survey, this paper
   proposes the development path of college ideological and political
   education in the era of artificial intelligence, that is, schools and
   teachers need to improve the transformation of traditional education as
   well as the construction of contemporary Internet education. This study
   offers the possibility of interdisciplinary research, expands the scope
   of ideological and political education research, and provides a

Title = {Artificial Intelligence-Based Real-Time Pineapple Quality Classification
   Using Acoustic Spectroscopy},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The pineapple is an essential fruit in Taiwan. Farmers separate
   pineapples into two types, according to the percentages of water in the
   pineapples. One is the ``drum sound pineapple{''} and the other is the
   ``meat sound pineapple{''}. As there is more water in the meat sound
   pineapple, the meat sound pineapple more easily rots and is more
   challenging to store than the drum sound pineapple. Thus, farmers need
   to filter out the meat sound pineapple, so that they can sell pineapples
   overseas. The classification, based on striking the pineapple fruit with
   rigid objects (e.g., plastic rulers) is most commonly used by farmers
   due to the negligibly low costs and availability. However, it is a
   time-consuming job, so we propose a method to automatically classify
   pineapples in this work. Using embedded onboard computing processors,
   servo, and an ultrasonic sensor, we built a hitting machine and combined
   it with a conveyor to automatically separate pineapples. To classify
   pineapples, we proposed a method related to acoustic spectrogram
   spectroscopy, which uses acoustic data to generate spectrograms. In the
   acoustic data collection step, we used the hitting machine mentioned
   before and collected many groups of data with different factors; some
   groups also included the noise in the farm. With these differences, we
   tested our deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN)
   performances. The best accuracy of the developed CNN model is 0.97 for
   data Group V. The proposed hitting machine and the CNN model can assist
   in the classification of pineapple fruits with high accuracy and time
   efficiency.},

   for English Learners in Higher Education Institutions},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 31},
Abstract = {At present, the traditional teaching mode of English teaching in higher
   vocational institutions is not compatible with the characteristics and
   teaching objectives of higher vocational education under the new
   situation. The rapid development of interactive multimedia technology
   has brought a new teaching style and experience to English basic
   education. Interactive teaching mode breaks the shackles of traditional
   teaching mode and focuses on cultivating students' English language
   application ability and communicative ability. By using interactive
   multimedia technology, to begin with, students can improve their English
   communicative ability more effectively in several aspects, including
   stimulating their interest in speaking, creating an English-speaking
   environment, and mobilizing their subjective initiative, and can
   organically integrate with the learning of professional knowledge to lay
   a foundation for employment. This paper proposes an interactive
   intelligent learning system based on artificial intelligence algorithms.
   This new English teaching system with the interaction theory realizes
   the transformation of a new student-centered teaching mode, which is a
   great contribution to English classroom learning in higher education
   institutions.},

Title = {A human-centered artificial intelligence approach for privacy protection

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based Ambient Assisted
   Living systems play an important role in smart cities by improving the
   quality of life of the elderly population. Many Ambient Assisted Living
   systems are coupled with Android Apps for command-and-control purposes.
   Consequently, the privacy and security of Ambient Assisted Living
   systems depend on the privacy and security of the corresponding Android
   Apps, which follow a privacy self-management model. Unfortunately, the
   privacy self-management model ignores the decision-making abilities of
   the elderly and increases their cognitive loads, which put their privacy
   protection and wellbeing at stake. In this paper, we follow a Human
   Centered Artificial Intelligence inspired approach for addressing these
   issues. This approach uses privacy as a shared responsibility model
   instead of the privacy self-management model. We have proposed two
   algorithms, the participatory privacy protection algorithm-I, and
   participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal
   privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its
   runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working
   of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the
   proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for
   Android Apps. The proposed algorithms can improve the privacy protection
   of Ambient Assisted Living App users in smart cities and relieve them
   through cognitive offloading.

Abstract = {With the advent of the ``Internet+{''} era, with the rapid development
   of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud
   computing, big data, and artificial intelligence, the era of the
   technological change in education has arrived, with diversification of

   provides an opportunity for the research and practice of personalized
   support services. Personalized learning is the future learning method
   under the demands of smart education, and the learner's interest feature
   model is the core of personalized learning services. Although the
   research on smarter classrooms has achieved certain results, there are
   still shortcomings that cannot be ignored, that is, how to use smarter
   classrooms to meet the ``personalized needs{''} of learners and give
   students ``personalized feedback{''} is still an urgent problem to be
   solved. Therefore, building a student interest model in a smart learning
   environment will help teachers better capture students' learning
   interests and personalized needs, so as to provide them with

Abstract = {Ethical artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks can be the catalyst in
   improving the safety and wellbeing of people when developing AI systems.
   In 2020 Rolls-Royce released its ethical and trustworthiness toolkit,
   The Aletheia Framework (TM), which helps guide organisations as they
   consider the ethics around the use of AI. It covers three facets: social
   impact, accuracy and trust, and governance - which apply across all uses
   of AI. By adopting AI ethics and trust frameworks, oncologists can
   ensure the ratio between the benefit and harms of AI can be maximised.
   With AI transforming every sector, collaboration across industries to
   share ideas and learn from each other - even unlikely partnerships
   between engineering and oncology - could help optimise that transition.

   how to discover better reaction coordinates (RCs) for describing
   accurately non-classical nucleation situations; the development of more
   accurate force fields for describing the nucleation of multiple

Title = {Design and Application of Artificial Intelligence Technology-Driven
   Education and Teaching System in Universities},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {In recent years, many colleges and universities have been experimenting
   and exploring the evaluation of education and teaching system and have
   achieved certain results. In order to understand the quality of
   education and teaching system in colleges and universities, to improve
   the school conditions, and to promote the reform of teaching management,
   methods and means of evaluating the quality of education and teaching
   system in general higher education institutions are needed. Modern
   university education and teaching system should realize the combination
   of classroom teaching and practice teaching, and education and teaching
   system adopts the mode of the combination of on-campus practice and
   off-campus practice, so the design of teaching system is the key to the
   quality of teaching. Aiming at the current problem that talents
   cultivated by colleges and universities can hardly meet social demands
   in terms of engineering practice ability, innovation ability, and
   international competitiveness, this paper proposes the evaluation and
   adjustment of college education and teaching system driven by algorithms
   based on artificial intelligence (AI). By designing the teaching system
   of talent cultivation, and then establishing a quantitative and
   controllable quality assurance system for practical teaching, a new
   mechanism for the design of university education system is further
   explored. Specifically, the framework of the instructional system is
   built with the aid of an actor-critic algorithm in reinforcement
   learning, which assists in the design of the university education
   system, allowing students to truly understand, master and flex their
   knowledge, and strengthening the correct understanding of the students'
   internal learning mechanisms. The practical teaching effect shows that
   the AI-driven instructional designs are more popular with contemporary
   students and have higher evaluation scores. The numerical experiment
   results also show the stability of the instructional design, overcoming
   the drawbacks of traditional manual subjectivity in the design.
   AI-driven college education and teaching system is conducive to
   cultivating students' solid technical theoretical foundation. Therefore,
   through the AI-driven teaching system to strengthen the training of
   practical ability, so as to comprehensively improve students'
   comprehensive quality and innovation ability.},

Title = {An explainable artificial intelligence approach for unsupervised fault
   detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential task in today's
   production processes. Currently, several machine learning and deep
   learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault
   detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption
   and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be
   provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is
   related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical
   data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a
   new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is
   here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature
   extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the
   vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted.
   Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in
   an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The
   modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be
   implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations
   (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the
   feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the
   fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed,
   namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis. The
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets
   containing different mechanical faults in rotating machinery. The study
   also presents a comparison between models used in machine learning
   explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the
   Isolation Forest (Local-DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several
   state-ofart anomaly detection algorithms in rotating machinery is
   included.},

   Artificial Intelligence Algorithm},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {OCT 7},
Abstract = {There is still a certain deviation between the current artificial
   intelligence technology and the traditional learning mode, which makes
   it unable to be effectively applied in teaching and learning. Therefore,
   an effective method needs to be proposed to use functions to predict
   data. Function calculation can not only solve the complex problems of
   data calculation process but also make the data evenly distributed to
   take full advantage of the capabilities of each system. In this
   experiment, we mainly use the control function. After substituting the
   data into the control function, the function will automatically classify
   the data. In this paper, according to the actual situation of physical
   education in colleges and universities, from the two aspects of
   artificial intelligence and comprehensive learning algorithm, to build a
   system which can collect and analyze the past achievements of college
   students' physical education performance simulation can effectively help
   the design of physical education curriculum. According to the
   distribution of experimental data, a specific conclusion can be drawn;
   that is, the test model we choose can calculate and measure the physical
   fitness level of students, but there are big differences. In contrast,
   our experimental method using the ensemble computing model can not only
   predict and analyze the physical fitness level of college students but
   also reduce errors and shorten the time required for the experiment.},

Abstract = {Today, English is the world's main international language and is widely
   spoken. In this context, the learning of English has long been valued by
   all countries. In addition, English plays an essential role in the
   process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of
   countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as
   China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has
   become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has
   increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside
   world, its developing science and technology, and its rising
   international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking
   professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and
   social development and enable China to play a greater and more active
   role in international affairs, which has great practical and
   far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional
   English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of
   issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the
   change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English
   teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial
   intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence
   technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the
   optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network
   technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent
   and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the
   maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech
   evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or
   even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due
   to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the
   products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly
   intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English
   classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects.
   Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence
   technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to
   design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied
   to college English teaching. As information technology continues to
   evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how
   it can be better used in the teaching of subjects. Therefore, the use of
   online information technology in teaching and learning presents a great
   opportunity for research and practice in English language learning at
   the university level.},

   intelligent music teaching mode is applied in the actual teaching
   process, and students' feelings for intelligent music classrooms are
   explored by a questionnaire survey. Finally, the teaching effect is
   analyzed. The results show that 96.7\% of the students hold a positive
   attitude towards the new teaching mode, indicating that contemporary
   students have relatively high adaptation to and recognition with the
   development of artificial intelligence (AI). 84\% of the students are
   not particularly skilled in the operation of the intelligent network
   platform, and 9.3\% of the students believe that the operation of the
   platform is relatively difficult. Therefore, teachers should teach
   students how to use tablets. 95\% of the students hold that teachers can
   quickly find teaching resources related to the course content on the
   tablet and introduce them to students in the teaching process,
   indicating that teachers are familiar with the usage of new teaching
   equipment. On the whole, students have a good experience of the new
   teaching mode. This new teaching mode based on AI is a response to the

Abstract = {In this paper, we use partial differential equations combined with
   artificial intelligence methods to conduct an in-depth study and
   analysis of the curriculum system of accounting and finance professional
   education and training. Under the condition of high-performance advanced
   computers, neural network technology has been developed rapidly and
   started to adapt to the requirements of computational accuracy and speed
   in the field of PDEs. Neural networks have good self-learning as well as
   self-adaptive capabilities, and the use of deep neural networks to solve
   the numerical solution of partial differential equations has become a
   popular application that has emerged recently. The system provides a
   variety of interfaces for the output of calculation results, which can
   be directly or indirectly read into the calculation results by various
   common drawing software programs. In addition, the system can also
   directly plot the results using its plotting plug-in. This paper
   presents a case study to illustrate the overview of the practical work
   of the group before the application of accounting AI, i.e., the human
   manual model, reveals the problems faced by the accounting practice in
   this model and then discusses the specific application process and the
   effect it brings, emphasizing the superiority of accounting AI.
   Intra-group heterogeneity is to fully consider the learning ability,
   interest, personality, gender, and other factors of individual students
   when grouping, to ensure the differences between the members of the
   group. In terms of accounting personnel and accounting credit system,
   which are indirectly affected by AI in accounting, this paper discusses
   the overview before the application of AI in accounting and the impact
   and challenges after the application and then comes up with
   countermeasures for the development of accounting. Through the study of
   specific enterprises to elaborate the current situation of the
   application of accounting AI in enterprises and its impact, it exposes
   that the application of accounting AI has a great impact on the
   accounting process, accounting information quality, accounting
   personnel, accounting information security, and other aspects of
   enterprises and this paper proposes solutions in four aspects: first,
   machine learning for adversarial AI needs to be promoted; second,
   AI-related laws need to be improved; third, management accounting talent
   transformation needs to be realized; and fourth, the integration of
   artificial intelligence and accounting needs to be deepened.},

Abstract = {With the advancement of technological society, human-like a machine and
   intelligent systems are used to overcome diverse issues of daily life.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) role is obvious in catering to the
   automation of these systems. Intelligent systems are used in a number of
   fields like healthcare, agriculture, mining, complex decision making,
   automatic vehicle, educational institutions, and many others. Approaches
   of AI and 5G have transformed the learning and teaching approaches
   through earlier and smooth access to contents of education. Learning
   processes are now made productive and interactive through which students
   can enhance their skills of language through communication with AI-based
   machine agents instead of native speakers. Various platforms are
   available which has the capabilities to understand the uncontrollable
   power of students and can ultimately create content according to the
   level of students. In order to undertake the aim of teaching
   effortlessly and flawlessly, the teachers should make use of AI-based
   methods. Learners' writing, speaking, and listening skills can be
   improved with the use of a variety of technologies based on AI, natural
   language processing, machine learning, and deep learning. The current
   research proposes a decision support system for evaluating the function
   of the 5G network and AI in situational teaching research in higher
   education. The study's experimental results showed that the intended
   study was effective, and the outcomes were satisfactory.},

Title = {The Cultivation of Cross-Cultural Communicative Competence in English
   Teaching under the Background of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence expressed by machines
   made by humans and is a manifestation of human intelligence. On the
   whole, artificial intelligence includes two aspects: ``artificial{''}
   and ``intelligence.{''} Artificial is created by man, and information
   work covers a number of areas, for instance thinking and consciousness.
   The process from feeling memory to thinking is called ``wisdom.{''} The
   result of wisdom is behavior and language. The expression process of
   behavior and language is called ``ability,{''} and the two are
   collectively called ``intelligence.{''} However, there is no unified
   explanation for intelligence at present, but there is no doubt about the
   widespread. Big data processing includes multiple data processing
   processes, but data quality is the most important link in the entire
   process, and each data processing link will have an impact on the
   quality of big data. The big data processing process mainly includes
   data collection, data preprocessing, data storage, data processing and
   analysis, data display/data visualization, data application, and other
   links. The aim of this paper is to explore the studies on the
   development of intercultural intercommunication skills in English
   language learning and teaching in the context of artificial intelligence
   and big data. It is hoped that this will be done in the light of AI and
   big data technologies. We can explore the current situation of
   cross-cultural communication, provide new learning directions for
   cross-cultural communication, and promote cultural exchange and
   dissemination. This paper investigates students' attitudes towards
   cross-cultural communication by means of a questionnaire and then
   briefly tests students' cross-cultural communication ability. The
   experimental results of this paper show that 4 students have mastered
   cross-cultural knowledge, accounting for 3\%; 8 students have mastered
   cross-cultural knowledge very well, accounting for 4\%, and 9 students
   have mastered cross-cultural knowledge, accounting for 7\%. There are 12
   people who are very knowledgeable about cross-cultural knowledge,
   accounting for 9\%. These data show that the current students have very
   little knowledge of intercultural communication, and their intercultural
   communication skills need to be improved.},

Title = {Design of a Higher Education Question and Answer System Based on
   Multimodal Adversarial Networks},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Higher education question and answer system is a current research
   hotspot in the field of natural language processing and artificial
   intelligence, which can return accurate answers directly and also allow
   users to input in natural language, avoiding the need to return large
   collections of valid and invalid data links for users to filter twice.
   In recent years, deep learning techniques have made great progress in
   the field of natural language processing, thus making it possible to
   apply it in the field of teaching and learning in junior high school.
   Most of the traditional quiz systems based on traditional retrieval
   techniques have problems such as insufficient semantic portrayal of
   text, inability to extract semantic features in context, and poor
   processing of complex utterances. In order to fill the gap and
   deficiencies of question and answer systems in junior high school
   teaching, this paper applies multimodal and adversarial network-related
   technologies to build a multimodal adversarial network-based question
   and answer system for higher education. The experimental results show
   that the principles of the traditional application system and the
   multimodal adversarial system designed in this paper are similar, but
   the current application system is relatively more effective.},

   in improving teaching effects, realizing high efficiency and
   intelligence, and improving refined education. The application of public
   mental health based on artificial intelligence engineering in the
   practice of the teaching effect of business administration has a very
   positive significance for accurately discovering the mental health and
   teaching effect of business administration students. For the sake of
   improving the teaching effect of business administration major, we come
   up with a method for the influence of public mental health on the
   teaching effect of business administration profession based on
   artificial intelligence engineering. Firstly, we collect the video and
   audio of the teaching of business administration, conducts data
   screening and cleaning, and sorts out the video and audio
   synchronization clips as training data. Secondly, we propose a
   multimodal feature extraction network and a multimodal fusion network
   for the extraction and fusion of video and audio clips, respectively.
   Then, the fully connected network structure is used to evaluate and
   classify the effect of business administration professional teaching,
   and use mental health factors for evaluation to avoid human intervention
   and improve the prediction effect. Finally, through intensive
   experimental results, we prove that the method raised by us can use
   artificial intelligence engineering to evaluate the teaching effect of
   business administration majors from the perspective of public mental
   health and achieve good experimental results.},

Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {In order to improve the reliability of higher education quality
   evaluation, this paper improves the RBF neural network algorithm based
   on the characteristics of higher education teaching data. Using RBF
   neural network technology, the predictive model established after
   learning from samples of actual teaching data can be used to evaluate
   teaching quality. Moreover, this paper combines the improved RBF neural

   vector machine (SVM) to build a sentiment analysis module and a teaching
   quality evaluation module. After the model is constructed, the
   performance of the model built in this article is evaluated, and the
   performance of the model is displayed by combing statistics. The
   teaching quality assessment of the higher education model is between

Title = {Effect of Artificial Intelligence Tutoring vs Expert Instruction on
   Learning Simulated Surgical Skills Among Medical Students A Randomized
   Clinical Trial},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 22},
Abstract = {IMPORTANCE To better understand the emerging role of artificial
   intelligence (AI) in surgical training, efficacy of Al tutoring systems,
   such as the Virtual Operative Assistant (VOA), must be tested and
   compared with conventional approaches.
   OBJECTIVE To determine how VOA and remote expert instruction compare in
   learners' skill acquisition, affective, and cognitive outcomes during
   surgical simulation training.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This instructor-blinded randomized
   clinical trial included medical students (undergraduate years 0-2) from
   4 institutions in Canada during a single simulation training at McGill
   Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre,
   Montreal, Canada. Cross-sectional data were collected from January to
   April 2021. Analysis was conducted based on intention-to-treat. Data
   were analyzed from April to June 2021.
   INTERVENTIONS The interventions included 5 feedback sessions, 5 minutes
   each, during a single 75-minute training, including 5 practice sessions
   followed by 1 realistic virtual reality brain tumor resection. The 3
   intervention arms included 2 treatment groups, AI audiovisual
   metric-based feedback (VOA group) and synchronous verbal scripted
   debriefing and instruction from a remote expert (instructor group), and
   a control group that received no feedback.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were change in
   procedural performance, quantified as Expertise Score by a validated
   assessment algorithm (Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System
   {[}ICEMS]; range, -1.00 to 1.00) for each practice resection, and
   learning and retention, measured from performance in realistic
   resections by ICEMS and blinded Objective Structured Assessment of
   Technical Skills (OSATS; range 1-7). Secondary outcomes included
   strength of emotions before, during, and after the intervention and
   cognitive load after intervention, measured in self-reports.
   RESULTS A total of 70 medical students (41 {[}59\%] women and 29
   {[}41\%] men; mean {[}SD] age, 21.8 {[}2.3] years) from 4 institutions
   were randomized, including 23 students in the VOA group, 24 students in
   the instructor group, and 23 students in the control group. All
   participants were included in the final analysis. ICEMS assessed 350
   practice resections, and ICEMS and OSATS evaluated 70 realistic
   resections. VOA significantly improved practice Expertise Scores by 0.66
   (95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.77) points compared with the instructor group and by
   0.65 (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.77) points compared with the control group (P <
   .001). Realistic Expertise Scores were significantly higher for the VOA
   group compared with instructor (mean difference. 0.53 {[}95\% CI, 0.40
   to 0.67] points; P < .001) and control (mean difference. 0.49 {[}95\%
   CI, 0.34 to 0.61] points; P < .001) groups. Mean global OSATS ratings
   were not statistically significant among the VOA (4.63 {[}95\% CI, 4.06
   to 5.20] points), instructor (4.40 {[}95\% CI, 3.88-4.91] points), and
   control (3.86 {[}95\% CI, 3.44 to 4.27] points) groups. However, on the
   OSATS subscores, VOA significantly enhanced the mean OSATS overall
   subscore compared with the control group (mean difference, 1.04 {[}95\%
   CI, 0.13 to 1.96] points; P = .02), whereas expert instruction
   significantly improved OSATS subscores for instrument handling vs
   control (mean difference, 1.18 {[}95\% CI, 0.22 to 2.14]; P = .01). No
   significant differences in cognitive load, positive activating, and
   negative emotions were found.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, VOA
   feedback demonstrated superior performance outcome and skill transfer,
   with equivalent OSATS ratings and cognitive and emotional responses
   compared with remote expert instruction, indicating advantages for its
   use in simulation training.},

   the questionnaire is designed to investigate students' learning
   attitudes and teachers' effectiveness. The results show that the scores
   of the students are poor, and the traditional teaching method should be
   updated to improve the teaching quality of IPE. Motivating students'
   enthusiasm and updating the teaching content are the main tasks to
   improve students' learning effect on IPE. College students who receive
   IPE based on big data have better academic performance and a positive
   learning attitude, and each factor is more significant than 0.05. It is
   concluded that big data has a considerable impact on IPE. It can promote
   students' mastery of the knowledge and improve their learning
   efficiency.},

   complete the training task better. The results show that the theoretical
   system of expert system can constantly update the knowledge system and
   case base. When students learn the relevant content and ask questions,
   the system can give some answers and assist students to complete the
   training work. The response time of the system is less than 5 s, the
   response time of more content is less than 10 s, and the accuracy of the
   system is about 90\%. Therefore, the use of HCI technology in AI to
   design an efficient sports training environment teaching system is of

Title = {Exploring Useful Teacher Roles for Sustainable Online Teaching in Higher
   Education Based on Machine Learning},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 emergency necessitated a rapid transition to online
   teaching by university lecturers. Hence, lecturers need to develop and
   reorganize their instructions and adjust their teaching roles and
   activities to the technological demands so as to further facilitate
   their continuous usage of technological systems after the crisis. Based
   on the behaviors of lecturers who utilized a particular teaching
   system-Rain Classroom-during school closure, this study aimed to predict
   their retention of online teaching beyond lockdown. Classical
   machine-learning classifiers were adopted to make predictions, most of
   which had an accuracy greater than 73\%. Moreover, through a byproduct
   of these algorithms-feature scoring-we also aimed to determine the prime
   activities and roles that have strong relationships with lecturers'
   retention dispositions. The domain meaning of feature scoring was
   revealed based on a specific conceptualization of perceived usefulness
   and the TAM model, which further enlightened system devisers about
   strategies to improve technological quality. A coevolution mechanism was
   thus formed, both providing guidance for lecturers in changing their
   overt behaviors with respect to online teaching and supporting the
   customization of system functionalities, so as to foster the mutual
   adaption of teachers' pedagogies and artifact affordances. The findings,
   concerning useful teaching roles (namely, learning assessment, guiding
   technology usage, and learning support) and activities (such as in-class
   exercises, monitoring of students' attendance, formal testing, etc.),
   are corroborated by evidence from other reports in the literature.},

Title = {Performance and application analysis of ANFIS artificial intelligence
   for pressure prediction of nanofluid convective flow in a heated pipe},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Heat transfer augmentation of the nanofluids is still an attractive
   concept for researchers due to rising demands for designing efficient
   heat transfer fluids. However, the pressure loss arisen from the
   suspension of nanoparticles in liquid is known as a drawback for
   developing such novel fluids. Therefore, prediction of the nanofluid
   pressure, especially in internal flows, has been focused on studies.
   Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a commonly used approach for such
   a prediction of fluid flow. The CFD tools are perfect and precise in
   prediction of the fluid flow parameters. But they might be
   time-consuming and expensive, especially for complex models such as
   3-dimension modeling and turbulent flow. In addition, the CFD could just
   predict the pressure, and it is disabled for finding the relationship of
   such variables. This study is intended to show the performance of the
   artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm as an auxiliary method for
   cooperation with the CFD. The turbulent flow of Cu/water nanofluid
   warming up in a pipe is considered as a sample of a physical phenomenon.
   The AI algorithm learns the CFD results. Then, the relation between the
   CFD results is discovered by the AI algorithm. For this purpose, the
   adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is adopted as AI
   tool. The intelligence condition of the ANFIS is checked by benchmarking
   the CFD results. The paper outcomes indicated that the ANFIS
   intelligence is met by employing gauss2mf in the model as the membership
   function and x, y, and z coordinates, the nanoparticle volume fraction,
   and the temperature as the inputs. The pressure predicted by the ANFIS
   at this condition is the same as that predicted by the CFD. The
   artificial intelligence of ANFIS could find the relation of the
   nanofluid pressure to the nanoparticle fraction and the temperature. The
   CFD simulation took much more time (90-110 min) than the total time of
   the learning and the prediction of the ANFIS (369 s). The CFD modeling
   was done on a workstation computer, while the ANFIS method was run on a
   normal desktop.},

Title = {Differential Biases and Variabilities of Deep Learning-Based Artificial
   Intelligence and Human Experts in Clinical Diagnosis: Retrospective
   Cohort and Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence may have
   different diagnostic characteristics than human experts in medical
   diagnosis. As a data-driven knowledge system, heterogeneous population
   incidence in the clinical world is considered to cause more bias to DL
   than clinicians. Conversely, by experiencing limited numbers of cases,
   human experts may exhibit large interindividual variability. Thus,
   understanding how the 2 groups classify given data differently is an
   essential step for the cooperative usage of DL in clinical application.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the differential
   effects of clinical experience in otoendoscopic image diagnosis in both
   computers and physicians exemplified by the class imbalance problem and
   guide clinicians when utilizing decision support systems. Methods: We
   used digital otoendoscopic images of patients who visited the outpatient
   clinic in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Severance Hospital,
   Seoul, South Korea, from January 2013 to June 2019, for a total of
   22,707 otoendoscopic images. We excluded similar images, and 7500
   otoendoscopic images were selected for labeling. We built a DL-based
   image classification model to classify the given image into 6 disease
   categories. Two test sets of 300 images were populated: balanced and
   imbalanced test sets. We included 14 clinicians (otolaryngologists and
   nonotolaryngology specialists including general practitioners) and 13
   DL-based models. We used accuracy (overall and per-class) and kappa
   statistics to compare the results of individual physicians and the ML
   models. Results: Our ML models had consistently high accuracies
   (balanced test set: mean 77.14\%, SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean
   82.03\%, SD 3.06\%), equivalent to those of otolaryngologists (balanced:
   mean 71.17\%, SD 3.37\%; imbalanced: mean 72.84\%, SD 6.41\%) and far
   better than those of nonotolaryngologists (balanced: mean 45.63\%, SD
   7.89\%; imbalanced: mean 44.08\%, SD 15.83\%). However, ML models
   suffered from class imbalance problems (balanced test set: mean 77.14\%,
   SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03\%, SD 3.06\%). This was
   mitigated by data augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes,
   but rare disease classes still had low per-class accuracies. Human
   physicians, despite being less affected by prevalence, showed high
   interphysician variability (ML models: kappa=0.83, SD 0.02;
   otolaryngologists: kappa=0.60, SD 0.07). Conclusions: Even though ML
   models deliver excellent performance in classifying ear disease,
   physicians and ML models have their own strengths. ML models have
   consistent and high accuracy while considering only the given image and
   show bias toward prevalence, whereas human physicians have varying
   performance but do not show bias toward prevalence and may also consider
   extra information that is not images. To deliver the best patient care
   in the shortage of otolaryngologists, our ML model can serve a
   cooperative role for clinicians with diverse expertise, as long as it is
   kept in mind that models consider only images and could be biased toward
   prevalent diseases even after data augmentation.},

   through the computer's intelligent control system is also a complex and
   heavy project in computer system engineering. The load balancing image
   processing system is that the user sends the request to the load
   balancer, and uses the scheduling algorithm to send the user request to
   the back-end server. The back-end server processes the user request in a
   timely manner, and feeds back the processing result to the load
   balancer, and the load balancer finally feeds back the processing result
   to the user. In order to cultivate high-quality talents, when setting up
   courses, the school should train dance students in various aspects
   according to the characteristics of the school, so that students have a
   variety of knowledge and abilities. Therefore, when setting up the
   curriculum, it is necessary to make targeted settings according to the
   students' situation and the characteristics of the school and the
   classification of subjects. In this way, a variety of curriculum
   settings can be realized in which theoretical courses are adapted to
   professional courses, and a combination of required courses and elective
   courses. It enables students to have more choices when choosing courses,
   which is more suitable for students' individual development and
   training.},

Abstract = {In today's society, China's social market continues to develop, which
   has caused the whole society to attach great importance to the
   professional ethics of Chinese citizens and put forward new requirements
   and expectations for it. This paper aims to research and discuss the
   diversified integration and integrated application of ideological and
   political teaching resources based on artificial intelligence model
   algorithms. This paper first analyzes and discusses the feasibility of
   the integration and application of moral education resources in
   ideological and political textbooks. Political classrooms provide
   favorable support for the integration and application of moral education
   resources, and political classrooms have become a practical carrier for
   the integration and application of moral education resources. And then
   it introduces the artificial intelligence model algorithm-artificial
   neural network algorithm. Artificial intelligence is a new intelligent
   machine that can make intelligent responses similar to human actions
   according to human actions. Finally, it studies the use of social
   teaching resources for ideological and political education in city A and
   conducts a comprehensive analysis on the integration and utilization of
   moral education teaching resources for ideological and political courses
   in colleges and universities. In the survey of ``Whether the
   introduction of local social resources in the political class of city A
   is helpful to students' learning,{''} 84 teachers thought it was very
   helpful, 12 teachers thought it was helpful, and only 3 teachers thought
   it was not helpful. It can be found that most teachers think that it is
   helpful for students to introduce social resources in political lessons.
   At the same time, in order to better improve the reliability and
   validity of moral resources and to internalize social moral norms into
   students' hearts, it is only by combining moral resources with students'
   moral growth.},

Abstract = {Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality
   can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher
   Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of LMS users' data, involving
   artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic,
   is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the
   structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can
   efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating
   their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This
   study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer)
   consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends,
   considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037
   students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the
   proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal
   dependencies representation of Moodie LMS users' QoI, revealing
   perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level.
   Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and
   analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained
   cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of
   the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to
   increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback
   approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors
   and decision-makers of HEls could be assisted to holistically visualize,
   understand and assess OLEs stakeholders' needs within the teaching and
   learning practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Threefold Optimized Forecasting of Electricity Consumption in Higher

Abstract = {Energy management benefits both consumers and utility companies alike.
   Utility companies remain interested in identifying and reducing energy
   waste and theft, whereas consumers' interest remain in lowering their
   energy expenses. A large supply-demand gap of over 6 GW exists in
   Pakistan as reported in 2018. Reducing this gap from the supply side is
   an expensive and complex task. However, efficient energy management and
   distribution on demand side has potential to reduce this gap
   economically. Electricity load forecasting models are increasingly used
   by energy managers in taking real-time tactical decisions to ensure
   efficient use of resources. Advancement in Machine-learning (ML)
   technology has enabled accurate forecasting of electricity consumption.
   However, the impact of computation cost afforded by these ML models is
   often ignored in favour of accuracy. This study considers both accuracy
   and computation cost as concurrently significant factors because
   together they shape the technology environment as well as create
   economic impact. Thus, a three-fold optimized load forecasting model is
   proposed which includes (1) application specific parameters selection,
   (2) impact of different dataset granularities and (3) implementation of
   specific data preparation. It deploys and compares the widely used
   back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF)
   models for the prediction of electricity consumption of buildings within
   a university. In addition to the temporal and historical power
   consumption date as input parameters, the study also embeds weather data
   as well as university operational calendars resulting in improved
   performance. The outcomes are indicative that the granularity i.e. the
   scale of details in data, and set of reduced and full input parameters
   impact performance accuracies differently forANNandRF models.
   Experimental results show that overall RF model performed better both in
   terms of accuracy as well as computational time for a 1-min, 15-min and
   1-h dataset granularities with themean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
   of 2.42, 3.70 and 4.62 in 11.1 s, 1.14 s and 0.3 s respectively, thus
   well suited for a real-time energy monitoring application.},

Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of modern information technology, students'
   education and computer technology begin to blend, and the modern
   teaching mode is quite different from the traditional education mode
   known in the past. In view of the current college English teaching in
   the information age, this study puts forward the way of integrating
   computer information technology with college English teaching, improves
   MLP algorithm, puts forward a new artificial intelligence algorithm,
   improves its calculation efficiency, and uses the optimized GA-MLP-NN
   (Genetic Neural Network Algorithm for the Multilayer Perceptron)
   algorithm in college students' oral correction program. Firstly,
   GA-MLP-NN algorithm is used to optimize college English teaching so that
   more complex structures can be learned and dealt with. Incremental
   hidden layer unit neural network is added, which makes the operation
   more accurate based on S-type recursive function. Then, the oral English
   system is established, using the GA-MLP-NN neural network model.
   Finally, we evaluate the parameters of the model, design a comparative
   experiment and a questionnaire survey to verify the rationality and
   feasibility of the guess, which proves that this method can deal with
   more complex programs, and make students learn English more handy and
   close to students' needs by using computer technology.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Manual monitoring of animal behavior is time-consuming and prone to
   bias. An alternative to such limitations is using computational
   resources in behavioral assessments, such as tracking systems, to
   facilitate accurate and long-term evaluations. There is a demand for
   robust software that addresses analysis in heterogeneous environments
   (such as in field conditions) and evaluates multiple individuals in
   groups while maintaining their identities. The Ethoflow software was
   developed using computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) tools
   to monitor various behavioral parameters automatically. An object
   detection algorithm based on instance segmentation was implemented,
   allowing behavior monitoring in the field under heterogeneous
   environments. Moreover, a convolutional neural network was implemented
   to assess complex behaviors expanding behavior analyses' possibilities.
   The heuristics used to generate training data for the AI models
   automatically are described, and the models trained with these datasets
   exhibited high accuracy in detecting individuals in heterogeneous
   environments and assessing complex behavior. Ethoflow was employed for
   kinematic assessments and to detect trophallaxis in social bees. The
   software was developed in desktop applications and had a graphical user
   interface. In the Ethoflow algorithm, the processing with AI is separate
   from the other modules, facilitating measurements on an ordinary
   computer and complex behavior assessing on machines with graphics
   processing units. Ethoflow is a useful support tool for applications in
   biology and related fields.},

Abstract = {With the development of modern mobile communication, artificial
   intelligence (AI) has begun to enter people's life, and it is also
   constantly changing the modern education mode. First, the structure of
   BPN (back-propagation network) is designed in this paper. On this basis,
   genetic algorithm is applied to optimize, which can accelerate the
   convergence speed and achieve the effect of global optimization. The
   results obtained from the research also meet the expected value,
   realizing the purpose of optimizing the BP algorithm. This paper
   analyzes the AI teaching expert system, summarizes their functions and
   characteristics, and points out that the college students' ideological
   and political teaching system based on the mobile AI terminal can be
   used as the teaching manager, teaching assistant, and even as the
   teaching object to guide students' learning. At the same time, the
   article also points out that the application and development direction
   of artificial intelligence in the teaching field can be divided into
   three stages: primary application, intermediate application, and
   advanced application, so as to provide theoretical guidance for the
   construction and analysis of ideological and political teaching system
   for college students using mobile artificial intelligence terminals.},

Abstract = {Despite the growing interest towards big data within higher education
   institutions (HEI), research on big data analytics capability within the
   HEI context is somewhat limited. This study's main objective is to have
   a better understanding of the utilisation of big data analytics
   capability for data-driven decision-making to achieve better performance
   from Malaysian HEIs. Despite the growing interest towards big data
   within higher education institutions (HEI), research on big data
   analytics capability within the HEI context is rather limited. This
   study's main objective is to have a better understanding of the
   utilisation of big data analytics capability for data-driven
   decision-making to achieve better performance from Malaysian HEIs. This
   study validates an integrative model by combining information processing
   theory and resource-based view theory. Unlike extant literature, this
   study proposed methodology involving dual-stage analysis involving of
   Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling and evolving
   Artificial Intelligence named deep learning (Artificial Neural Network)
   were performed. The application of deep ANN architecture can predict
   83\% of accuracy for the proposed model. Besides, the outcome of
   data-driven decision making from the relationship between big data
   analytic capability and datadriven decision making towards the
   performance of HEIs has significant findings. Results revealed that
   datadriven decision making could positively play an essential role in
   the relationship between big data analytic capability and performance of
   HEIs. Theoretically, the newly integrated theoretical model that
   incorporates information processing theory and resource-based view
   provides useful guidelines to HEI's about the crucial capabilities and
   resources that must be put into place to reap the benefits associated
   with big data implementations in the wake of Industry Revolution 4.0.},

Abstract = {Chemical engineers rely on models for design, research, and daily
   decision-making, often with potentially large financial and safety
   implications. Previous efforts a few decades ago to combine artificial
   intelligence and chemical engineering for modeling were unable to
   fulfill the expectations. In the last five years, the increasing
   availability of data and computational resources has led to a resurgence
   in machine learning-based research. Many recent efforts have facilitated
   the roll-out of machine learning techniques in the research field by
   developing large databases, benchmarks, and representations for chemical
   applications and new machine learning frameworks. Machine learning has
   significant advantages over traditional modeling techniques, including
   flexibility, accuracy, and execution speed. These strengths also come
   with weaknesses, such as the lack of interpretability of these black-box
   models. The greatest opportunities involve using machine learning in
   time-limited applications such as real-time optimization and planning
   that require high accuracy and that can build on models with a
   self-learning ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become
   more intelligent over time. The greatest threat in artificial
   intelligence research today is inappropriate use because most chemical
   engineers have had limited training in computer science and data
   analysis. Nevertheless, machine learning will definitely become a
   trustworthy element in the modeling toolbox of chemical engineers. (C)

Title = {Analysis of the Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Role Cognition in
   the Education System},
Journal = {OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {Taking the entire education system in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province,
   Central China, as an example, this paper uses the questionnaire survey
   method to analyze the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on role
   cognition in the education system. The education system targeted by this
   questionnaire survey involves 8 categories: preschool education, primary
   education, secondary education, higher education, adult education,
   computer network education, enterprise education, and social education;
   the respondents include 368 teachers, 402 students or learners, 118
   school managers, and 124 family members of students or learners in all
   above education categories. The questionnaire design has a total of 34
   question classified into 6 role cognition items, with a 5-level score; a
   total of 1012 questionnaires were distributed, and 978 were recovered
   with a recovery rate of 96.64\%, in which 957 were valid questionnaires
   with an effective rate of 97.85\%. The study results show that the
   learning of AI-assisted courses is strongly dependent on course role
   cognition, and the construction of role cognition is related to the
   understanding of course content, teaching methods, and activity methods.
   Therefore, the effect of AI on role cognition in the education system
   needs to be systematically analyzed from the aspects of function
   realization form, resource presentation method, supporting hardware
   form, teacher-student interaction method, and representation method of
   works. As connecters, teacher's role cognition is limited by the degree
   of understanding learners, the amount of resources, and data processing
   capabilities, but the advantage is that they can flexibly monitor and
   adjust. AI technology is flexible and diverse, it functions in learning
   and teaching activities in a variety of ways, and there is no agreement
   on the terminology to describe its role in role recognition. The results
   of this paper provide a reference for further researches on the effect
   of AI on role cognition in the education system.},

Abstract = {People are realizing that linguistic competence is a vital aspect of
   communicative competence as language study and instruction have
   progressed. Grammar instruction is not only important but also the
   primary means of achieving communication skills in foreign language

   learning-based virtual reality technology college English immersive
   context teaching approach. The goal is to increase pupils' capacity to
   learn English. The experimental groups used VR innovation immersive
   environment education from the standpoint of constructivist theory in a
   compared teaching experiment with 2 classifications of freshman at a
   university, while the control class used standard multimedia equipment
   and conventional teaching techniques. Students only passively acquire a
   lot of material from instructors in the class, they have limited
   opportunity to engage in the exchange of information and express
   thoughts in the chosen language, and they are ``immersed{''} in the
   Chinese environment most of the time. With an average score of 2.8
   points higher than the control group, the overall English level was
   likewise higher. English teaching system based on computer big data
   method, optimization of oral English teaching system based on
   computer-aided technology, and artificial intelligence are the existing
   methods used for comparison. This demonstrates that using constructivism
   theory and virtual reality technology in college English immersing
   contextual education may genuinely increase students' English levels.},

Title = {Tissue miRNA Combinations for the Differential Diagnosis of

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Simple Summary The histological differential diagnosis of adrenocortical
   adenoma and carcinoma is difficult and requires great expertise. MiRNAs
   were shown to be useful for the differential diagnosis of benign and
   malignant tumors of several organs, and several findings have suggested
   their utility in adrenocortical tumors as well. Here, we have selected
   tissue miRNAs based on the literature search, and used machine learning
   to identify novel clinically applicable miRNA combinations. Combinations
   with high sensitivity and specificity (both over 90\%) have been
   identified that could be promising for clinical use. Besides being a
   useful adjunct to histological examination, these miRNA combinations
   could enable preoperative adrenal biopsy in patients with adrenal tumors
   suspicious for malignancy. The histological analysis of adrenal tumors
   is difficult and requires great expertise. Tissue microRNA (miRNA)
   expression is distinct between benign and malignant tumors of several
   organs and can be useful for diagnostic purposes. MiRNAs are stable and
   their expression can be reliably reproduced from archived
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Our purpose was
   to assess the potential applicability of combinations of
   literature-based miRNAs as markers of adrenocortical malignancy.
   Archived FFPE tissue samples from 10 adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), 10
   adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples were
   analyzed in a discovery cohort, while 21 ACC and 22 ACA patients were
   studied in a blind manner in the validation cohort. The expression of
   miRNA was determined by RT-qPCR. Machine learning and neural
   network-based methods were used to find the best performing miRNA
   combination models. To evaluate diagnostic applicability, ROC-analysis
   was performed. We have identified three miRNA combinations (hsa-miR-195
   + hsa-miR-210 + hsa-miR-503; hsa-miR-210 + hsa-miR-375 + hsa-miR-503 and
   hsa-miR-210 + hsa-miR-483-5p + hsa-miR-503) as unexpectedly good
   predictors to determine adrenocortical malignancy with sensitivity and
   specificity both of over 90\%. These miRNA panels can supplement the
   histological examination of removed tumors and could even be performed
   from small volume adrenal biopsy samples preoperatively.},

Abstract = {The Corona Virus Disease 2019 epidemic broke out in 2020, and digital
   technologies pervaded all aspects of people's lives, resulting in a
   significant shift in how education is delivered. The importance and role
   of digital technologies and online learning are highlighted in this
   paper, which examines the challenges posed by the sudden epidemic crisis
   to higher education institutions, analyses the factors that universities
   must consider in order to effectively create flexible learning pathways,
   and examines the challenges posed by the sudden epidemic crisis to
   higher education institutions. In the postepidemic era, the use of the
   Internet and online teaching platforms by university faculty to
   integrate online and offline teaching has not only facilitated the
   construction of ``golden courses{''} but also added impetus to teaching
   reform, and digital technology-based teaching models have provided
   higher education practitioners with the opportunity to rethink
   scholarship and innovative teaching. In this paper, we propose a
   personalized learning resource recommendation system that includes user
   profiles to fully explore and analyze users' learning behaviors and
   cognitive characteristics and enhance the depth and breadth of
   personalized education with the help of the Internet and artificial
   intelligence technologies in order to provide meaningful information and
   thoughts for higher education institutions to discuss and adapt to the
   education model in the postepidemic era. The goal is to provide useful
   information and ideas for higher education institutions to discuss and
   adapt to the postepidemic education paradigm.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence-supported applications in head and neck cancer
   radiotherapy treatment planning and dose optimisation},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {496-502},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction: The aim of this review is to describe how various
   AI-supported applications are used in head and neck cancer radiotherapy
   treatment planning, and the impact on dose management in regards to
   target volume and nearby organs at risk (OARs).
   Methods: Literature searches were conducted in databases and publisher
   portals Pubmed, Science Direct, CINAHL, Ovid, and ProQuest to peer
   reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2021. Results: Out of 464
   potential ones, ten articles covering the topic were selected. The
   benefit of using deep learning-based methods to automatically segment
   OARs is that it makes the process more efficient producing clinically
   acceptable OAR doses. In some cases automated treatment planning systems
   can outperform traditional systems in dose prediction.
   Conclusions: Based on the selected articles, in general AI-based systems
   produced time savings. Also, AI-based solutions perform at the same
   level or better than traditional planning systems considering
   auto-segmentation, treatment planning and dose prediction. However,
   their clinical implementation into routine standard of care should be
   carefully validated
   Implications to practice: AI has a primary benefit in reducing treatment
   planning time and improving plan quality allowing dose reduction to the
   OARs thereby enhancing patients' quality of life. It has a secondary
   benefit of reducing radiation therapists' time spent annotating thereby
   saving their time for e.g. patient encounters. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Human resources are the cornerstone of operational operation. Good
   management of human resource information can enable businesses to
   operate effectively. However, for the time being, most enterprises still
   use traditional methods of allocating human resources, which are
   difficult to meet the development needs of enterprises. In order to find
   the optimal allocation of human resources in an enterprise, this article
   is based on ``Internet + artificial intelligence,{''} using methods such
   as case analysis and literature analysis to collect data from databases
   such as CNKI, Wanfang Database, and SSCI, and uses fog computing to
   build a model for the optimal allocation of human resources which is
   proposed, and a large number of relevant literature studies are read and
   analyzed through the literature survey method. According to the research
   needs, through the research and summary of the content of the
   literature, the research structure found that there are many problems in
   the current human resource information management system. After the
   optimization of models and algorithms, the allocation of human resources
   has been greatly improved. The matching rate of personnel and job
   positions has increased by more than 50\%. The operation efficiency
   index of the enterprise is above 0.8, an increase of about 30\%. This
   shows that ``Internet + artificial intelligence{''} can effectively
   optimize the enterprise human resource information management system,
   promote the greater use of its human resource value, bring higher
   economic returns to the enterprise, and provide assistance for the
   long-term stable and healthy development of the enterprise.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Despite tremendous gains from deep learning and the promise of
   artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to improve diagnosis and save
   costs, there exists a large translational gap to implement and use AI
   products in real-world clinical situations. Adoption of standards such
   as Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for
   Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis, Consolidated Standards of Reporting
   Trials, and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging
   is increasing to improve the peer-review process and reporting of AI
   tools. However, no such standards exist for product-level review.
   Methods: A review of clinical trials showed a paucity of evidence for
   radiology AI products; thus, the authors developed a 10-question
   assessment tool for reviewing AI products with an emphasis on their
   validation and result dissemination. The assessment tool was applied to
   commercial and open-source algorithms used for diagnosis to extract
   evidence on the clinical utility of the tools.
   Results: There is limited technical information on methodologies for
   FDA-approved algorithms compared with open-source products, likely
   because of intellectual property concerns. Furthermore, FDA-approved
   products use much smaller data sets compared with opensource AI tools,
   because the terms of use of public data sets are limited to academic and
   noncommercial entities, which precludes their use in commercial
   products.
   Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals a broad spectrum of maturity
   and clinical use of AI products, but a large gap exists in exploring
   actual performance of AI tools in clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Purpose - In this paper, the author has tried to outline the main ideas
   in connection with what the author conceives to be the university of the
   future, a university that should not only educate people within the
   university system but also prepare them to fill specific job positions
   at both local and global levels, apart from necessarily providing them
   with the critical thinking and competences in autonomous learning that
   will make them flexible and capable of adapting to the job market and to
   a fast-changing world in general. Design/methodology/approach - The
   author has revised some of the major issues that are going to determine
   the direction of the university of the future, i.e. the employment
   opportunities of tomorrow; the role of new technologies, especially the
   impact of artificial intelligence (AI); quality in higher education; and
   internationalization. Findings - The author has also pointed out the
   importance of the technologies and the great role they indisputably play
   in present and future education at all levels, a fact that has been
   particularly and hugely enhanced and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic
   situation, thereby facilitating and fostering distance learning. This is
   very much connected to the application of AI to higher education,
   another unavoidable issue of utmost importance for the university of the
   future. While these technological advances present a challenge to
   universities, which must determine which are necessary and desirable and
   how to implement them, it is, ultimately, our responsibility to use
   them, in an ethical way, to the benefit of our students. The university
   of the future also has to be of high quality, and this involves carrying
   out important and decisive action having to do with matters of
   inclusion, hiring policies and the expansion of international
   opportunities for all parties involved. Originality/value - This paper
   outlines the main ideas in connection with what the author conceives to
   be the university of the future, a university that should not only
   educate people within the university system but also prepare them to
   fill specific job positions at both local and global levels, apart from
   necessarily providing them with the critical thinking and competences in
   autonomous learning that will make them flexible and capable of adapting
   to the job market and to a fast-changing world in general. Moreover, the
   role of new technologies (especially the impact of AI), quality and
   internationalization are also discussed as relevant factors in this view
   of the university of the future.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and AI-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are
   transforming the approach to education. In particular, ChatGPT's
   potential to process large amounts of data and learn from user
   interactions makes it a beneficial resource for students, albeit with
   some reluctance from some teachers. This study aimed to explore the
   acceptance of ChatGPT by university students. The researchers
   administered an online survey to 400 Spanish university students aged
   18-64 (M = 21.80; SD = 6.40). The results of the methodological approach
   based on the UTAUT2 model for technology adoption showed that: 1) gender
   was not a determining variable in any construct while the experience of
   use was a factor conditioning a higher score on all constructs; 2)
   experience, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, and
   habit were influential in behavioral intention to use ChatGPT; 3)
   facilitating conditions, habit, and behavioral intention were
   conditioning factors in user behavior. Finally, this report discusses
   the findings and practical implications of the work and recommends some
   good uses for ChatGPT.},

Abstract = {Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause
   of mortality in hospitals(1-3), but the best treatment strategy remains
   uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in
   the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal
   and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients(1,4-6). To tackle
   this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement
   learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which
   extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds
   by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned
   optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment
   decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician's selected
   treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a
   large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was
   lowest in patients for whom clinicians' actual doses matched the AI
   decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically
   interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the vigorous development and application of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), the application of AI in education is
   becoming more and more extensive. This study makes a theoretical
   analysis of AI-Intellectualized Information Technology (IT). Discrete
   Cosine Transform (DCT)-Based Speech Recognition (SR) and Genetic
   Algorithm (GA)-Based Image Recognition (IR) are used to analyze the
   College Ideological and Political Education (IAPE). The research
   findings prove that the advantages of integrating AI-intellectualized IT
   on College IAPE outweigh the disadvantages. The improvement of
   technological development, which accounts for 71.17\% of undergraduate
   gains, is the most significant, and the smallest gain is technology
   coverage, which is 36.80\%. Overall, 57.21\% are interested in new
   technology, and the students' enthusiasm accounts for 30.77\%. Most of
   the students focus on the innovation performance of technology,
   accounting for 75.92\%. With an average influence of 89.04\% on
   undergraduates, technology has the largest impact, followed by 85.78\%
   on students with masters or higher degrees. The largest impact of
   diversified teaching methods for all students is 62.48\%. This study
   provides some reference values for AI-intellectualized IT research and
   analysis, as well as students' IAPE.},

Title = {The Implementation Path of Labor Education in Applied Universities
   Driven by Artificial Intelligence Technology},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Labor education is an endogenous demand for the construction and
   development of applied colleges and universities, and it is of great
   significance for the times to promote the construction of applied
   colleges and universities. The labor spirit shaping of college students
   in applied colleges and universities is conducive to helping college
   students grow up to be the new man of the times, promoting the core task
   of transformation and development of applied colleges and universities
   and meeting the construction needs of a modern educational power with
   the socialism of Chinese characteristics. In view of the outstanding
   problems of cognitive bias, inaccurate positioning, one-sided means, and
   disregard of results in the process of shaping labor spirit in applied
   colleges and universities, the university should grasp the three key
   words of local, applied, and open system construction in the stage of
   spirit generation, use specific tactics to promote the combination of
   educators, educated and educational influence in the stage of spirit
   strengthening, and form the overall style and action of interpreting
   labor spirit by the struggle in the stage of spirit sublimation. In the
   stage of spiritual sublimation, the overall style and action
   consciousness of interpreting the spirit of labor by struggle are
   formed. Cultivating students' technical application ability, nurturing
   quality spirit, and cultivating students' sense of professional identity
   and responsibility are the value demands of labor education in applied
   colleges and universities. In view of the problems of the implementation
   path of labor education in applied colleges and universities, a labor
   education status assessment model based on artificial intelligence
   technology is proposed for establishing the value goal of talent
   cultivation in applied colleges and universities as the guide and
   promoting the effective labor education in applied colleges and
   universities in the new era by continuously solving various problems in
   labor education and cultivating qualified socialist builders and
   successors.},

Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {157},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for the
   classification of breast lesions on ul-trasound images.Method: In the
   present study, three separate data cohorts containing 1288 breast
   lesions from three countries (Malaysia, Iran, and Turkey) were utilized
   for MLmodel development and external validation. The model was trained
   on ultrasound images of 725 breast lesions, and validation was done
   separately on the remaining data. An expert radiologist and a radiology
   resident classified the lesions based on the BI-RADS lexicon. Thirteen
   morphometric features were selected from a contour of the lesion and
   underwent a three-step feature selection process. Five features were
   chosen to be fed into the model separately and combined with the imaging
   signs mentioned in the BI-RADS reference guide. A support vector
   classifier was trained and optimized.Results: The diagnostic profile of
   the model with various input data was compared to the expert radiologist
   and radiology resident. The agreement of each approach with
   histopathologic specimens was also determined. Based on BI-RADS and
   morphometric features, the model achieved an area under the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.885, which is higher
   than the expert radiologist and radiology resident performances with AUC
   of 0.814 and 0.632, respectively in all cohorts. DeLong's test also
   showed that the AUC of the ML protocol was significantly different from
   that of the expert radiologist (Delta AUCs = 0.071, 95\%CI: (0.056,
   0.086), P = 0.005). Conclusions: These results support the possible role
   of morphometric features in enhancing the already well -excepted
   classification schemes.},

Title = {Step-Counting Function of Adolescent Physical Training APP Based on
   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of the information age, Internet and other
   technologies have been making progress, people's fitness awareness has
   been gradually enhanced, and sports fitness app has emerged as the times
   require. This paper mainly studies the step-counting function of
   physical training app for teenagers based on artificial intelligence.
   This paper uses the modular development method to achieve the functional
   requirements of the system as the goal, respectively, for parameter
   management, website configuration, system log, interface security
   settings, SMS configuration, WeChat template message and several
   functional modules to achieve system configuration. In this paper, three
   types of sensors are used to analyze the data changes in the process of
   walking through three types of data, and different weights are given as
   the results of step-counting. When the peak value of sensor data is
   measured, only the peak value of the primary axial data of each sensor
   is analyzed, which should be determined according to the actual axial
   value of the sensor. In this paper, the users' evaluation indexes of
   sports fitness app are divided into two groups: importance and
   satisfaction, so the obtained data are directly divided into two groups:
   importance and satisfaction of user experience indexes of sports fitness
   app, and the two groups of data are matched with the sample t test to
   ensure the scientific conclusion. Finally, the advantages and
   disadvantages of the user experience of college students' sports fitness
   app are analyzed through IPA analysis. Heuristic evaluation is carried
   out on the step app to score the second-level usability index of the
   app. The first-level usability index score and the total usability score
   of the step app are obtained by calculation. There is not much

Abstract = {The current new round of scientific and technological revolution
   represented by artificial intelligence is rapidly driving a new wave of
   development of the times, and the rapid iterative update of science and
   technology is triggering new changes in educational concepts and
   educational thinking methods. Only by deeply understanding the reshaping
   of education concept, teaching concept, and learning concept by the new
   generation of scientific and technological revolution, as well as the
   major opportunities and challenges brought to education, can we
   understand the future direction of the development of ideological and
   political education for college students. This study takes the
   ideological and political education and teaching of college students as
   the research object. It begins by defining artificial intelligence and
   the ideological and political education of college students and analyzes
   the new concepts of precise individualization, intelligent teaching, and
   evaluation brought by artificial intelligence to the ideological and
   political education of college students. Then, it selects the students
   who have studied ideological and political education network resources
   as the empirical objects, designs a questionnaire based on the emotional
   characteristics of the resources, implements a questionnaire survey,
   uses the Stata software to conduct a correlation analysis on the
   acceptance of the students, and finally verifies the resources. Combined
   with empirical results, this article analyzes the influence of emotional
   characteristics of resources on students' acceptance, reveals the
   carrier role of ideological and political network resources in school
   emotional education and students through mirror theory and student
   response theory, respectively, and establishes the principle of graded
   reading guidance.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom approach is aimed at improving learning outcomes
   by promoting learning motivation and engagement. Recommendation systems
   can also be used to improve learning outcomes. With the rapid
   development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, various systems
   have been developed to facilitate student learning. Accordingly, we
   applied AI-enabled personalized video recommendations to stimulate
   students' learning motivation and engagement during a systems
   programming course in a flipped classroom setting. We assigned students
   to control and experimental groups comprising 59 and 43 college
   students, respectively. The students in both groups received flipped
   classroom instruction, but only those in the experimental group received
   AI-enabled personalized video recommendations. We quantitatively
   measured students' engagement based on their learning profiles in a
   learning management system. The results revealed that the AI-enabled
   personalized video recommendations could significantly improve the
   learning performance and engagement of students with a moderate
   motivation level.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Sepsis may lead to kidney function decline in patients with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD), and the deleterious effect may persist in patients
   who survive sepsis. We used a machine learning approach to predict the
   risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in sepsis survivors. A total of
   11,661 sepsis survivors were identified from a single-center database of
   112,628 CKD patients between 2010 and 2018. During a median follow-up of
   3.5 years, a total of 1366 (11.7\%) sepsis survivors developed ESRD
   after hospital discharge. We adopted the random forest, extra trees,
   extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and
   gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithms to predict the risk of
   ESRD development among these patients. GBDT yielded the highest area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.879, followed by
   LGBM (0.868), and extra trees (0.865). The GBDT model revealed the
   strong effect of estimated glomerular filtration rates <25 mL/min/1.73
   m(2) at discharge in predicting ESRD development. In addition,
   hemoglobin and proteinuria were also essential predictors. Based on a
   large-scale dataset, we established a machine learning model computing
   the risk for ESRD occurrence among sepsis survivors with CKD. External
   validation is required to evaluate the generalizability of this model.},

Abstract = {Students must integrate into the development of ethnic education and
   accept applicable norms and policies, values, and processes so that
   academics can continue to develop in a good direction for exploring and
   researching intellectual Ideological and Political Learning (IPL). The
   creation of a data system for the administration of IPL for university
   students can boost knowledge and the quality of maintenance of IPL.
   Therefore, this paper suggests artificial intelligence-based Ideological
   and Political Learning (AI-IPL) of college students depending on the
   psychological quality measurements. The AI-IPL method is used for the
   ideological and political development of the college students to
   encourage the students both mentally and physically. The AI-IPL method
   creates the differences in opinion between some of the students, which
   define the IPL of the eventual tendency towards creative strategy and
   psychological education method. The thought created by students'
   experience must be evaluated for the requirements of learning and the
   experience of developing high-quality talent by the measure of political
   growth through innovating intellectual and political learning.},

Title = {Large-Scale Groundwater Monitoring in Brazil Assisted With
   Satellite-Based Artificial Intelligence Techniques},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Here, we develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach
   to monitor major Brazilian aquifers. The approach combines Gravity
   Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data and ground-based
   hydrogeological measurements from Brazil's Integrated Groundwater
   Monitoring Network at hundreds of wells distributed in 12 aquifers
   across the country. We tested model ensembles based on three AI
   approaches: Extreme Gradient Boost, Light Gradient Boosting Model and
   CatBoost, followed by a Linear Regression step. The approach is further
   boosted with wavelet and seasonal decomposition processes applied to
   GRACE data. To determine the AI-based model's sensitivity to data
   availability, we propose four experiments combining hydrogeological
   measurements from different aquifers. Groundwater storage (GWS)
   estimates from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are used
   as benchmark. A sensitivity analysis shows that the LR-based model
   ensemble is the best suited and to reproduce GWS change in all studied
   Brazilian aquifers. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms
   GLDAS in all experiments, with an root mean square error (RMSE) value of
   2.68 cm for the experiment that covers all monitored wells in Brazil.
   GLDAS resulted in RMSE = 6.76 cm. Using our AI model outputs, we
   quantified the GWS change of two major aquifers, Urucuia and Bauru-Caiu
   \& aacute;, over the past two decades: -31 and -6 km(3), respectively.
   Water loss is driven by a prolonged drought across most of the country
   and intensification of groundwater pumping for irrigation. This study
   demonstrates that combining satellite data and AI can be a
   cost-effective alternative to monitor poorly equipped aquifers at the
   continental scale, with possible global replicability.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence-assisted enumeration of ultra-small viruses with
   dual dark-field plasmon resonance probes},
Journal = {BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS},

Abstract = {Direct visual enumeration of viruses under dark-field microscope (DFM)
   using plasmon resonance probes (PRPs) is fast and convenient; however,
   it is greatly limited in the assay of real samples because of its
   inability to accurately identify false positives owing to non-specific
   adsorption. In this study, we propose an artificial in-telligence
   (AI)-assisted DFM enumeration strategy for the accurate assay of
   Enterovirus A71 (an ultra-small human virus) using two PRPs; a 40 nm
   silver nanoparticle probe (SNP) that appears bright blue under DFM, and
   a 120 nm gold nanorod probe (GNP) that appears red under DFM. The
   capture chip was prepared by immobilizing the SNPs with antibodies on
   the glass to capture the target virus and to form dichromatic sandwich
   structures with the GNPs, followed by imaging under a dark field (DF).
   Subsequently, the DF images of the capture chip were subjected to a
   two-step screening: first, using image processing, and thereafter using
   the AI algorithm screening to eliminate false positive results and
   background noise. The results revealed that the data from the
   AI-assisted dual PRPs assay were highly consistent with those of
   quantitative PCR (qPCR), and that the sensitivity with a minimum
   detectable concentration of 3 copies/mu L was 5 times higher than that
   of qPCR. The entire analysis was completed within 45 min. Therefore, our
   AI-assisted virus enumeration strategy with two DF PRPs holds great
   potential for ultra-sensitive and accurate quantification of viruses in
   real samples.},

Abstract = {In the market discourses of technological disruption, higher education
   institutions have routinely been positioned in deficit models and of
   anachronistic approaches to teaching at odds with the types of
   educational futures being presented by commercial organisations.
   Predominantly, automation technologies in the form of artificial
   intelligence are being promoted as the future of teaching. In this
   paper, on the other hand, we explore the prospects for using
   non-artificial intelligence automated agents in teaching and its impact
   on the teacher function at the University of Edinburgh. Through
   engagement with teachers, staff and students at the university, this
   research has identified use cases for bots, in what spaces they would be
   situated, and how they would supplement the teacher function. This paper
   argues that a community-driven approach combined with a sociomaterial
   conceptualisation can generate a shift from market discourses and to
   collaborative development of educational technologies.},

Title = {INHIBITING AND MOTIVATING FACTORS INFLUENCING TEACHERS' ADOPTION OF
   AI-BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING SOLUTIONS: PRIORITIZATION USING ANALYTIC
   HIERARCHY PROCESS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {693-723},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose The purpose of the present study is to prioritize the
   inhibiting and motivating factors underlying the adoption of AI based
   teaching and learning solutions by teachers in the higher education
   sector of India.
   Background AI based teaching and learning solutions are amongst the most
   important educational innovations. The intervention of AI in
   instructional methods can result in personalized teaching and learning
   experiences. AI enabled teaching and learning systems can give teachers
   a better understanding regarding their students' learning abilities,
   learning styles and progress.
   Methodology The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to find the
   relative importance of inhibiting and motivating factors. The primary
   data for making the pair-wise comparisons between the factors were
   obtained from a convenient sample of 32 teachers, teaching in various
   higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the National Capital Region
   (NCR) of Delhi, India.
   Contribution Though, the acceptance of AI based solutions has been
   studied in other contexts such as retail, banking, ecommerce, and so on;
   nonetheless, the acceptance of AI in the education sector has not
   grabbed much attention of researchers. Hence the study has made
   worthwhile contributions to the literature as it has specifically
   focused on the adoption of AI based teaching methods by teachers in
   higher education
   Findings The findings suggest that institutional barriers are the major
   inhibitors and recognition is the main motivator that affect teachers'
   behaviour towards adopting AI based teaching solutions. Overall, the
   findings of the study highlight the importance of institutional support
   in terms of resources, time, and recognition that may be provided to the
   teachers so that they can willingly integrate AI based methodologies
   into their teaching.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The study provides several
   implications for HEIs and developers of AI based educational solutions.
   The HEIs should provide adequate support to their teachers in terms of
   financial support, infrastructure and technical support. The developers
   should focus on developing such solutions that are compatible with the
   teachers' existing work style.
   Recommendations for Researchers Future studies can employ statistical
   techniques such as multiple regression analysis or structural equation
   modelling to examine the impact of these factors on the actual use
   behaviour of teachers regarding AI based teaching methods. More
   diversified samples that are statistically significant in size, can be
   considered to examine the teachers' behaviour regarding AI based
   instructional methods.
   Impact on Society AI technology can play a pivotal role in reshaping and
   remodeling higher education. AI is the technology of todays' times that
   has the capability of transforming the instructional methods. The
   educators need to understand that nowadays, teaching and learning are
   heading towards creative styles that embrace the use of innovative
   technologies such as AI.
   Future Research The adoption of AI in the field of education is at a
   very nascent stage in India, constant changes are likely to happen in
   the factors influencing the adoption of AI enabled teaching solutions.
   Future studies may come up with a more holistic model of factors to
   address this research problem.},

   science and non-computer science faculty members to gauge their
   perception on the integration of AI in an experiential learning platform
   to teach data science, as well as their perception on AI powered data
   science curriculum in higher education. Findings reveal three major
   themes which are defining data science, assembling interdisciplinary

Abstract = {The explosive growth in volume, velocity, and diversity of data produced
   by mobile devices and cloud applications has contributed to the
   abundance of data or `big data.' Available solutions for efficient data
   storage and management cannot fulfill the needs of such heterogeneous
   data where the amount of data is continuously increasing. For efficient
   retrieval and management, existing indexing solutions become inefficient
   with the rapidly growing index size and seek time and an optimized index
   scheme is required for big data. Regarding real-world applications, the
   indexing issue with big data in cloud computing is widespread in
   healthcare, enterprises, scientific experiments, and social networks. To
   date, diverse soft computing, machine learning, and other techniques in
   terms of artificial intelligence have been utilized to satisfy the
   indexing requirements, yet in the literature, there is no reported
   state-of-the-art survey investigating the performance and consequences
   of techniques for solving indexing in big data issues as they enter
   cloud computing. The objective of this paper is to investigate and
   examine the existing indexing techniques for big data. Taxonomy of
   indexing techniques is developed to provide insight to enable
   researchers understand and select a technique as a basis to design an
   indexing mechanism with reduced time and space consumption for BD-MCC.
   In this study, 48 indexing techniques have been studied and compared
   based on 60 articles related to the topic. The indexing techniques'
   performance is analyzed based on their characteristics and big data
   indexing requirements. The main contribution of this study is taxonomy
   of categorized indexing techniques based on their method. The categories
   are non-artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence, and
   collaborative artificial intelligence indexing methods. In addition, the
   significance of different procedures and performance is analyzed,
   besides limitations of each technique. In conclusion, several key future
   research topics with potential to accelerate the progress and deployment
   of artificial intelligence-based cooperative indexing in BD-MCC are
   elaborated on.},

   the goal of improving patient outcomes and learning best practices from
   clinicians to help clinical decision support for treating CHD patients.
   Methods We formed the treatment strategy as a sequential decision
   problem, and applied an AI supervised reinforcement learning-long
   short-term memory (SRL-LSTM) framework that combined supervised learning
   (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) with an LSTM network to track
   patients' states to learn a recommendation model that took a patient's
   diagnosis and evolving health status as input and provided a treatment
   recommendation in the form of whether to take specific drugs. The
   experiments were conducted by leveraging a real-world intensive care
   unit (ICU) database with 13,762 admitted patients diagnosed with CHD. We
   compared the performance of the applied SRL-LSTM model and several
   state-of-the-art SL and RL models in reducing the estimated in-hospital
   mortality and the Jaccard similarity with clinicians' decisions. We used
   a random forest algorithm to calculate the feature importance of both
   the clinician policy and the AI policy to illustrate the
   interpretability of the AI model. Results Our experimental study
   demonstrated that the AI model could help reduce the estimated
   in-hospital mortality through its RL function and learn the best
   practice from clinicians through its SL function. The similarity between
   the clinician policy and the AI policy regarding the surviving patients
   was high, while for the expired patients, it was much lower. The dynamic
   treatment strategies made by the AI model were clinically interpretable
   and relied on sensible clinical features extracted according to
   monitoring indexes and risk factors for CHD patients. Conclusions We
   proposed a pipeline for constructing an AI model to learn dynamic
   treatment strategies for CHD patients that could improve patient
   outcomes and mimic the best practices of clinicians. And a lot of
   further studies and efforts are needed to make it practical.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the educational landscape of
   institutions of higher education, which were predominantly face-to-face.
   In Malaysia, many universities converted their courses into online
   courses to keep up with the challenges of working from home during the
   pandemic, using web technologies and blended learning approaches.
   However, there are challenges in ensuring students' attention and
   retention rates are maintained and enough support and scaffolding are
   provided to them when they are learning online. As such, the MERLIN
   Project was undertaken to develop a virtual learning assistant that
   would provide online support to students outside of their online
   classes. The project used Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with
   Natural Language Processing (NLP) features to develop a chatbot that
   simulated human-like conversation between chatbot and students. Content
   in the learning environment was media-rich and mapped to Mayer's 12
   Multimedia Learning Principles. Data from 102 students was collected to
   gauge their perceptions and feedback. Results showed that students found
   the chatbot to be helpful in their learning process and improved their
   understanding of the course material. A conceptual learning framework
   for the use of AI chatbots as learning assistants is proposed to improve
   students' online learning experiences in the new normal.},

Abstract = {Good learning adaptability is the key to ensure students' learning
   quality. Learning maladjustment not only affects students' learning
   effect but also affects the effectiveness of AI-enabled English
   learning. Although some studies have found that there is a certain
   degree of poor learning adaptability in the practice of artificial
   intelligence (AI) supporting English teaching, most studies only
   describe the phenomenon and do not further explore the causes of poor
   learning adaptability. Therefore, the research intends to understand the
   current situation of college students' English learning adaptability
   under the support of AI through the investigation and analysis of
   college students' English learning adaptability under the support of AI
   and clarifies the impact of various influencing factors on learning
   adaptability as well as the relationship between learning adaptability
   and various factors, and put forward strategies to improve students'
   learning adaptability. This research is a new exploration of learning
   adaptability in the field of AI English learning. At the same time, it
   is also an extension of the research environment of learning
   adaptability in information-based learning and a supplement to the
   research results. This paper combs the composition structure of college
   students' English learning adaptability under the support of AI and
   constructs the influencing factor model of college students' English
   learning adaptability under the support of AI. The research has certain
   theoretical significance and practical value.},

Abstract = {Some of the recent researches in Higher Education is making its way to
   figure out how things can be done more efficiently and smartly. They are
   making their foot-mark in adopting new technologies inside the college
   educational settings, while it's yet in the development stage. Some of
   the technological advancements have already been adopted and made
   compulsory for the proper functioning of the educational system.
   Besides, maintaining a stable functioning in the college community, to
   cope up with the increased demand for new technological adaptation in
   the Higher Educational society, technological terminologies and the
   recent trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) is considered to reach the goal and seems to be the
   possible solution. Classroom Assets or knowledge on the historical
   patterns in the classroom data which prevails in a traditional classroom
   can be collected via an IoT system that uses sensors to generate a huge
   volume of data and that assets could be used to make decisions on the
   interpretations to satisfy our needs. According to a report, the total
   number of IoT devices worldwide will be approximately 75 billion
   worldwide. But then the transformation from the theoretical
   conceptualization to the implementation is yet in its budding stage.
   Deep Learning as a whole is a subset of AI and Machine Learning, which
   will help the educational sector to make better decisions at the right
   time. Deep Learning along with Computer Vision is another trend set to
   possibly apply AI in every use case specifically for monitoring and
   investigating and analytic systems. Hence, to fill the gap between the
   two ends, Higher Educational Classrooms and the Technological Growth, we
   have made an investigation to figure out the possible applications of
   IoT and Deep Learning in the Classroom environment. An amalgam of
   Computer Vision (CV), IoT, and Deep Learning in the Educational
   Classrooms can promisingly give rise to smart, intelligent classrooms
   thus improving the staff and the student experiences by positively
   uplifting the educational perceptions.},

Month = {DEC 14},
Abstract = {For the past year, everyone has been facing difficulties due to the fast
   spreading of the Corona Virus. As an extension, students, parents, and
   teachers are handling the challenges in the education sector. Since the
   COVID days, the schools and colleges were closed, and hence, the
   students were lagging in their subjects. As an alternative to this
   scenario, offline classes are converted to online courses, otherwise
   called virtual classes with virtual classrooms. Due to this conversion,
   the teaching has become a little more advanced by incorporating various
   computer-based technologies. The technologies like artificial
   intelligence, cloud computing, and machine learning paved the way for
   exploring concepts in data transmission in terms of timely delivery of
   content, less error rate, and nontechnical terms like making the classes
   interactive and understanding the subject concepts. In this research
   work, the online teaching class on music is considered. To be specific,
   traditional Chinese music is taken for the study. An artificial
   intelligence model is designed with the aid of wireless sensor networks
   for the online class on the musical subject. Q-learning algorithm, which
   is an artificial intelligence-based reinforcement learning algorithm, is
   implemented. The aim of the Q-learning algorithm in this online teaching
   of classical music is to check the frequency level of the music that
   aids in the automatic transfer of another wavelength inside the dataset.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Road condition monitoring (RCM) has been a demanding strategic research
   area in maintaining a large network of transport infrastructures. With
   advancements in computer vision and data mining techniques along with
   high computing resources, several innovative pavement distress
   evaluation systems have been developed in recent years. The majority of
   these technologies employ next-generation distributed sensors and
   vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies to evaluate,
   classify and localize pavement distresses using the measured data. This
   paper presents an exhaustive and systematic literature review of these
   technologies in RCM that have been published from 2017-2022 by utilizing
   next-generation sensors, including contact and noncontact measurements.
   The various methodologies and innovative contributions of the existing
   literature reviewed in this paper, together with their limitations,
   promise a futuristic insight for researchers and transport
   infrastructure owners. The decisive role played by smart sensors and
   data acquisition platforms, such as smartphones, drones, vehicles
   integrated with non-intrusive sensors, such as RGB, and thermal cameras,
   lasers and GPR sensors in the performance of the system are also
   highlighted. In addition to sensing, a discussion on the prevalent
   challenges in the development of AI technologies as well as potential
   areas for further exploration paves the way for an all-inclusive and
   well-directed futuristic research on RCM.},

Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Classical data fusion methods can be roughly divided into two
   categories: one is based on random methods, such as weighted average,
   least squares, Kalman filtering, Bayesian estimation, DS evidence
   inference, and production rules; the other is based on artificial
   intelligence. Intelligent methods include fuzzy logic reasoning,
   artificial neural networks, and support vector machine methods. This
   paper introduces, analyzes, and summarizes the advantages and
   disadvantages of the above methods, as well as the level of use of these
   methods, and then introduces the current trend of data fusion technology
   toward the mixed development of multiple methods. This article is aimed
   at carrying out a research on the innovation of Wushu Sanda teaching
   mode in colleges and universities based on multisensor data fusion
   technology. This article puts forward the innovative theory of youth
   sports training in Sanda in the new era, combined with the current
   status of physical education in Chinese colleges and universities, and
   analyzes the practicality of the theory and the effect of system
   integration. This article accelerates reforms and collects data from
   four aspects: the policy system at the macro level, the integrated
   governance system at the meso level, the teacher service system at the
   micro level, and the digital industry system at the functional
   innovation level, and proposes innovative strategies for youth sports
   training and teaching in the new era. The results of the study show that
   people with 5.99 are more interested in the World Cup, accounting for
   the largest proportion, while the number of people who are interested in
   martial arts is the least, only 1.63. The innovative theory of youth
   sports training in Sanda in the new era improves the training effect of
   students by 60\% compared with ordinary college Sanda training. It can
   to a large extent protect students from reluctant exercises that do not
   receive physical education in traditional teaching. Physiologically, it
   has unique advantages for the development of students. The teaching
   innovation model of this article can effectively solve the problems of
   physical education organization difficulty.},

Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 16},
Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate and research the intelligent
   teaching system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and computer
   technology, which can provide a better education platform for the
   majority of education and teaching workers and also help college
   students improve their learning efficiency. This paper first introduces
   AI, system modules, computer technology, and some algorithms for
   establishing intelligent teaching systems, specifically introducing
   student modules, Bayesian algorithms, and so on, and then introduces
   intelligent teaching based on AI and computer technology. The
   experimental results show that the intelligent teaching system based on
   AI and computer technology has improved the teaching efficiency and
   management ability of the school, and the help of students has also
   played a great role. The intelligent teaching system not only helps
   students improve their learning efficiency by 9.8\% but also is favored
   by 56.8\% of teachers and students.},

Abstract = {This article shares the strategy for mainstreaming the Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs) at the University of Valencia (UV), which,
   although limited in its scale, may compel other Higher Education
   Institutions to think in technological and social progress aligned with
   the 2030 Agenda. It explicates a process driven by the UV, on the
   occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations (UN), and in
   collaboration with the Service for Geospatial, Information, and
   Telecommunications Technologies from the UN Support Base in Valencia
   (Spain) to prepare the online event: ``The United Nations We Want{''}.
   It was the culmination of a collaborative project between students and
   faculties from different scientific, technological, social, legal,
   humanistic, and health disciplines that structure the University of
   Valencia. The intention was that new generations experience the role
   they can have to shape the future we want, while the university
   community as a whole can become part of transformative institutional
   change that draws on both top-down and bottom-up strategies in pursuit
   of Education for Sustainable Development.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly employed in health care
   fields such as oncology, radiology, and dermatology. However, the use of
   AI in mental health care and neurobiological research has been modest.
   Given the high morbidity and mortality in people with psychiatric
   disorders, coupled with a worsening shortage of mental health care
   providers, there is an urgent need for AI to help identify high-risk
   individuals and provide interventions to prevent and treat mental
   illnesses. While published research on AI in neuropsychiatry is rather
   limited, there is a growing number of successful examples of AI's use
   with electronic health records, brain imaging, sensor-based monitoring
   systems, and social media platforms to predict, classify, or subgroup
   mental illnesses as well as problems such as suicidality. This article
   is the product of a study group held at the American College of
   Neuropsychopharmacology conference in 2019. It provides an overview of
   AI approaches in mental health care, seeking to help with clinical
   diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, as well as clinical and
   technological challenges, focusing on multiple illustrative
   publications. Although AI could help redefine mental illnesses more
   objectively, identify them at a prodromal stage, personalize treatments,
   and empower patients in their own care, it must address issues of bias,
   privacy, transparency, and other ethical concerns. These aspirations
   reflect human wisdom, which is more strongly associated than
   intelligence with individual and societal well-being. Thus, the future
   AI or artificial wisdom could provide technology that enables more
   compassionate and ethically sound care to diverse groups of people.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and big data profoundly impact people's way
   of life and way of thinking, and college ideological and political
   education (IPE) has gradually entered the era of online education. On
   account of this, this study designs an online education algorithm based
   on AI technology to help teachers better understand the situation of
   students' online IPE teaching and improve the management of IPE in
   universities. Firstly, the learning features of students are extracted
   through the Back Propagation Neural Network (BP) model. This model
   summarizes the shortcomings of feature extraction in machine learning,
   and can simultaneously obtain depth information from the signals of
   multiple sensors, thus increasing the overall algorithm classification
   accuracy. Secondly, combined with the human behavior recognition model,
   the status and behavior of students' IPE teaching can be obtained in
   real-time from students' listening devices. Finally, the algorithm's
   classification performance is evaluated by experiments and compared with
   the designed model. The results reveal that the recognition accuracy of
   the designed classification algorithms for the sample students is
   98.59\%, 98.99\%, 99.21\%, 100\%, 97.10\%, 95.61\%, and 100\%,
   respectively. In addition, comparing the algorithm with similar
   recognition algorithms, its index values of accuracy and precision are
   97.83\% and 97.82\%, respectively, which are better than similar
   classification algorithms. Finally, through the experimental samples,
   the accuracy of the human recognition model is tested and compared with
   other recognition models. The results reveal that the designed model has
   high recognition accuracy. This study is of great significance for
   improving teachers' innovative IPE methods and optimizing the management
   level of online IPE teaching.},

Title = {Multi-Task Assignment Method of the Cloud Computing Platform Based on
   Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {To realize load balancing of cloud computing platforms in big data
   processing, the method of finding the optimal load balancing physical
   host in the algorithm cycle is adopted at present. This optimal load
   balancing strategy that overly focuses on the current deployment problem
   has certain limitations. It will make the system less efficient and the
   user's waiting time unnecessarily prolonged. This paper proposes a task
   assignment method for long-term resource load balancing of cloud
   platforms based on artificial intelligence and big data (TABAI). The
   maximum posterior probability for each physical host is calculated using
   Bayesian theory. Euler's formula is used to calculate the similarity
   between the host with the largest posterior probability and other hosts
   as a threshold. The hosts are classified according to the threshold to
   determine the optimal cluster and then form the final set of candidate
   physical hosts. It improves the resource utilization and external
   service capability of the cloud platform by combining cluster analysis
   with Bayes' theorem to achieve global load balancing in the time
   dimension. The experimental results show that: TABAI has a smaller
   processing time than the traditional load balancing multi-task
   assignment method. When the time is >600 s, the standard deviation of
   TABAI decreases to a greater extent, and it has stronger external
   service capabilities.},

Abstract = {Scientific research in Saudi Arabia's universities has undergone
   significant changes in recent years with the speed of higher education
   expansion and the opening of new universities. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) can be applied to existing data analysis processes to enhance
   pattern recognition and to support advanced data analysis. This study
   aimed to investigate the obstacles to activating the role of university
   instructors and students in joint scientific research. The study also
   aimed to evaluate joint scientific research between university teachers
   and students in universities, as well as the mechanisms for activating
   joint scientific research among male and female students in health and
   humanities science within Saudi universities, to enhance creation and
   invention achievements. To determine the obstacles to activating
   scientific research roles between students and tutors in Saudi
   universities using AI, a simple random sampling technique was adopted
   for this study. A well-structured questionnaire was administered to 250
   respondents affiliated with universities in Saudi Arabia. The data
   collected were statistically analyzed with the aid of the Statistical
   Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. The results of this study
   revealed that the objectives of joint scientific research between
   university teachers and students in universities have a significant
   positive predictor of obstacles to activating the role of teachers in
   joint scientific research with students in Saudi universities. The study
   also showed that there was a statistically significant correlation (p
   value = 0.00) between each of the variables.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has recently been promising
   using deep neural networks. It is indeed even been in clinical trials
   more and more, with positive outcomes. Deep learning is the process of
   using algorithms to train a neural network model using huge quantities
   of data to learn how to execute a given task and then make an accurate
   classification or prediction. Apart from physical health monitoring,
   such deep learning models can be used for the mental health evaluation
   of individuals. This study thus designs a deep learning-based mental
   health monitoring scheme (DL-MHMS) for college students. This model uses
   the most efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the
   mental health status as positive, negative, and normal using the EEG
   signals collected from college students. The simulation analysis
   achieves the highest classification accuracy and F1 scores of 97.54\%
   and 98.35\%, less sleeping disorder rate of 21.19\%, low depression
   level of 18.11\%, reduced suicide attention level of 28.14\%, increasing
   personality development ratio of 97.52\%, enhance self-esteem ratio of
   98.42\%, compared to existing models.},

Abstract = {Efforts to raise the bar of higher education so as to respond to dynamic
   societal/industry needs have led to a number of initiatives, including
   artificial neural network (ANN) based educational data mining (EDM)
   inclusive. With ANN-based EDM, humongous amount of student data in
   higher institutions could be harnessed for informed academic advisory
   that promotes adaptive learning for purposes of student retention,
   student progression, and cost saving. Mining students' data optimally
   requires predictive data mining tool and machine learning technique like
   ANN. However, despite acknowledging the capability of ANN-based EDM for
   efficiently classifying students' learning behavior and accurately
   predicting students' performance, the concept has received less than
   commensurate attention in the literature. This seems to suggest that
   there are gaps and challenges confronting ANN-based EDM in higher
   education. In this study, we used the systematic literature review
   technique to gauge the pulse of researchers from the viewpoint of
   modeling, learning procedure, and cost function optimization using
   research studies. We aim to unearth the gaps and challenges with a view
   to offering research direction to upcoming researchers that want to make
   invaluable contributions to this relatively new field. We analyzed 190
   studies conducted in 2010-2018. Our findings reveal that hardware
   challenges, training challenges, theoretical challenges, and quality
   concerns are the bane of ANN-based EDM in higher education and offer
   windows of opportunities for further research. We are optimistic that
   advances in research along this direction will make ANN-based EDM in
   higher education more visible and relevant in the quest for higher
   education-driven sustainable development.},

Title = {Tourist Attraction Recommendation Method Based on Megadata and
   Artificial Intelligence Algorithm},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {As China's economy continues to grow of informational technology and
   mobile Internet industry, the online tourism industry has received more
   and more extensive attention and use. However, as an emerging industry,
   users often need to spend a lot of time to choose travel services that
   match their needs because of the complex amount of relevant information.
   Under such circumstances, this paper studied the recommendation method
   in travel platform. First, the big data is used to extract user data.
   Secondly, the current online travel business recommendation for users
   has the problem of low accuracy. The reason is that the services
   provided are still in traditional recommendation algorithm. In this
   paper, the Bayesian network is used to evaluate the user's attribute
   preference and generate a data model, using effective methods in
   artificial intelligence algorithms to improve collaborative filtering
   algorithms and finally generate hybrid recommendation algorithms.
   Compared with the traditional recommendation method, the experimental
   results showed that the research can improve the recommendation accuracy
   of tourist attractions by 6.55\%, increase the user's satisfaction for
   the platform, and enhance the visit rate and retention rate of the
   tourist attraction recommendation platform.},

Title = {Radiomics-Based Artificial Intelligence Differentiation of
   Neurodegenerative Diseases with Reference to the Volumetry},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},

Abstract = {This study aimed to build automated detection models-one by brain
   regional volume (V-model), and the other by radiomics features of the
   whole brain (R-model)-to differentiate mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   from cognitive normal (CN), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI). The objectives are to compare the models and
   identify whether radiomics or volumetry can provide a better prediction
   for differentiating different types of dementia. Method: 582 MRI
   T1-weighted images were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which is a multicenter
   operating open source database for AD. In total, 97 images of AD, 293
   images of MCI patient and 192 images of cognitive normal were divided
   into a training, a validation and a test group at a ratio of 70:15:15.
   For each T1-weighted image, volumetric segmentation was performed with
   the image analysis software FreeSurfer, and radiomics features were
   retrieved by imaging research software 3D slicers. Brain regional volume
   and radiomics features were used to build the V-model and R-model,
   respectively, using the random forest algorithm by R. The receiver
   operating characteristics (ROC) curve of both models were used to
   evaluate their diagnostic accuracy and reliability to differentiate AD,
   MCI and CN. Results: To differentiate MCI and CN, both V-model and
   R-model achieved excellent performance, with an AUC of 0.9992 +/- 0.0022
   and 0.9850 +/- 0.0032, respectively. No significant difference was found
   between the two AUCs, indicating both models attained similar good
   performance. In MCI and AD differentiation, the V-model and R-model
   yielded AUC of 0.9986 +/- 0.0013 and 0.9714 +/- 0.0175, respectively.
   The best performance was to differentiate AD from CN, where the V-model
   and R-model yielded AUC of 0.9994 +/- 0.0019 and 0.9830 +/- 0.009,
   respectively. The results suggested that both volumetry and radiomics
   approaches could be used in differentiating AD, MCI and CN, based on T1
   weighted MR images using random forest algorithm successfully.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the radiomics features from
   T1-weighted MR images achieved excellence performance in differentiating
   AD, MCI and CN. Compared to the volumetry method, the accuracy,
   sensitivity and specificity are slightly lower in using radiomics, but
   still attained very good and reliable classification of the three stages
   of neurodegenerations. In view of the convenience and operator
   independence in feature extraction, radiomics can be a quantitative
   biomarker to differentiate the disease groups.},

Abstract = {The construction and development of legal education in colleges and
   universities are an important driving force for the construction of a
   society ruled by law. Looking at the history of the development of legal
   education in colleges and universities, it can be said that every major
   change in it has an important relationship with the changes in the
   social background. Under the background of the rapid development of
   wireless communication and artificial intelligence technology at this
   stage, legal education in colleges and universities has also ushered in
   a new opportunity for upgrading. The purpose of this paper is at
   studying the realization path of legal education reform in colleges and
   universities based on the background of the new era. To consolidate the
   achievements in this field through active reform and to solve the main
   problems by constructing an optimized teaching system, in the selection
   of the survey method, the research uses the questionnaire survey method
   as the main source of data. According to the questionnaire, 60\% of the
   students indicated that they would take the initiative to study and
   continue to try new assessment methods to adapt to the autonomous
   learning of the law. Teachers should try their best to let students
   fully experience law teaching under wireless communication and AI in
   their usual teaching.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) methods for evaluating thyroid nodules on
   ultrasound have been widely described in the literature, with reported
   performance of AI tools matching or in some instances surpassing
   radiologists' performance. As these data have accumulated, products for
   classification and risk stratification of thyroid nodules on ultrasound
   have become commercially available. This article reviews FDA-approved
   products currently on the market, with a focus on product features,
   reported performance, and considerations for implementation. The
   products perform risk stratification primarily using a Thyroid Imaging
   Reporting and Data System (TIRADS), though may provide additional
   prediction tools independent of TIRADS. Key issues in implementation
   include integration with radiologist interpretation, impact on workflow
   and efficiency, and performance monitoring. AI applications beyond
   nodule classification, including report construction and incidental
   findings follow-up, are also described. Anticipated future directions of
   research and development in AI tools for thyroid nodules are
   highlighted.},

Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {With the development of digital media technology, its application in
   teaching and learning is becoming more widespread. Digital media
   technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or
   skills, reduces cognitive load, and promotes understanding of knowledge.
   Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also
   become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital
   media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media
   technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use
   to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a
   combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate
   the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural
   network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was
   used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media
   effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained
   through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the
   RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong
   generalization and extension ability in evaluating digital media
   teaching effectiveness, providing a new way to evaluate digital media
   teaching effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Objective Machine learning (ML) is expected to play an increasing role
   within primary health care (PHC) in coming years. No peer-reviewed
   studies exist that evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ML models
   compared to general practitioners (GPs). The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an ML classifier on primary headache
   diagnoses in PHC, compare its performance to GPs, and examine the most
   impactful signs and symptoms when making a prediction. Design A
   retrospective study on diagnostic accuracy, using electronic health
   records from the database of the Primary Health Care Service of the
   Capital Area (PHCCA) in Iceland. Setting Fifteen primary health care
   centers of the PHCCA. Subjects All patients that consulted a physician,
   from 1 January 2006 to 30 April 2020, and received one of the selected
   diagnoses. Main outcome measures Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive
   Predictive Value, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Receiver Operating
   Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) score
   for primary headache diagnoses, as well as Shapley Additive Explanations
   (SHAP) values of the ML classifier. Results The classifier outperformed
   the GPs on all metrics except specificity. The SHAP values indicate that
   the classifier uses the same signs and symptoms (features) as a
   physician would, when distinguishing between headache diagnoses.
   Conclusion In a retrospective comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of the
   ML classifier for primary headache diagnoses is superior to GPs.
   According to SHAP values, the ML classifier relies on the same signs and
   symptoms as a physician when making a diagnostic prediction.Keypoints
   Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML)
   in the context of primary health care, despite its considerable
   potential to aid in clinical work. This novel research sheds light on
   the diagnostic accuracy of ML in a clinical context, as well as the
   interpretation of its predictions. If the vast potential of ML is to be
   utilized in primary health care, its performance, safety, and inner
   workings need to be understood by clinicians.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Incidental pulmonary embolism (IPE) can be found on body CT.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using
   artificial intelligence to identify missed IPE on a large number of CT
   examinations. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all
   single-phase chest, abdominal, and pelvic (CAP) and abdominal and pelvic
   (AP) CT examinations performed at a single center over 1 year, for
   indications other than identification of PE. Proprietary visual
   classification and natural language processing software was used to
   analyze images and reports from all CT examinations, followed by a
   two-step human adjudication process to classify cases as true positive,
   false positive, true negative, or false negative. Descriptive statistics
   were assessed for prevalence of IPE and features (sub segmental versus
   central, unifocal versus multifocal, right heart strain or not) of
   missed IPE. Interrater agreement for radiologist readers was also
   calculated. Results: A total of 11,913 CT examinations (6,398 CAP, 5,515
   AP) were included. Thirty false-negative examinations were identified on
   CAP (0.47\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.32\%-0.67\%) and
   nineteen false-negative studies on AP (0.34\%; 95\% CI, 0.21\%-0.54\%)
   studies. During manual review, readers showed substantial agreement for
   identification of IPE on CAP (K = 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.86) and nearly
   perfect agreement for identification of IPE on AP (K = 0.86; 95\% CI,
   0.76-0.97). Forty-nine missed IPEs (0.41\%; 95\% CI, 0.30\%0.54\%) were
   ultimately identified, compared with seventy-nine IPEs (0.66\%; 95\% CI,
   0.53\%-0.83\%) identified at initial clinical interpretation.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence can efficiently analyze CT
   examinations to identify potential missed IPE. These results can inform
   peer-review efforts and quality control and could potentially be
   implemented in a prospective fashion.\& nbsp; J Am Coll Radiol

Abstract = {College physical education is too one-sided, which makes the teaching
   process evaluation meaningless. Based on this, based on neural network
   technology, this article combines artificial intelligence teaching
   system to build an artificial intelligence sports teaching evaluation
   model based on neural network. The artificial intelligence model starts
   from the process evaluation and the final evaluation. Moreover, it uses
   a recurrent neural network for data training and analysis, and
   introduces a new decoder to perform data processing, and introduces a
   simplified gated neural network internal structure diagram to build the
   internal structure of the model.In addition, this study designs a
   control experiment to evaluate the performance of the model constructed
   in this study. The research results show that the artificial
   intelligence model constructed in this paper has a good effect in the

Abstract = {COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2),

   learning. In this paper, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic
   and the increase in online learning impact college students' emotional
   wellbeing. We use several machine learning and statistical models to
   analyze data collected by the Faculty of Public Administration at the
   University of Ljubljana, Slovenia in conjunction with an international
   consortium of universities, other higher education institutions, and
   students' associations. Our results indicate that features related to
   students' academic life have the largest impact on their emotional
   wellbeing. Other important factors include students' satisfaction with
   their university's and government's handling of the pandemic as well as
   students' financial security.},

Title = {Determinants of coronavirus disease 2019 infection by artificial
   intelligence technology: A study of 28 countries},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Objectives
   The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected countries around the
   world since 2020, and an increasing number of people are being infected.
   The purpose of this research was to use big data and artificial
   intelligence technology to find key factors associated with the
   coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The results can be used as a
   reference for disease prevention in practice.
   Methods
   This study obtained data from the ``Imperial College London YouGov
   Covid-19 Behaviour Tracker Open Data Hub{''}, covering a total of
   291,780 questionnaire results from 28 countries (April 1 similar to
   August 31, 2020). Data included basic characteristics, lifestyle habits,
   disease history, and symptoms of each subject. Four types of machine
   learning classification models were used, including logistic regression,
   random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, to
   build prediction modules. The performance of each module is presented as
   the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Then, this
   study further processed important factors selected by each module to
   obtain an overall ranking of determinants.
   Results
   This study found that the area under the receiver operating
   characteristics curve of the prediction modules established by the four
   machine learning methods were all >0.95, and the RF had the highest
   performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve is
   0.988). Top ten factors associated with the coronavirus disease 2019
   infection were identified in order of importance: whether the family had
   been tested, having no symptoms, loss of smell, loss of taste, a history
   of epilepsy, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cystic fibrosis,
   sleeping alone, country, and the number of times leaving home in a day.
   Conclusions
   This study used big data from 28 countries and artificial intelligence
   methods to determine the predictors of the coronavirus disease 2019
   infection. The findings provide important insights for the coronavirus
   disease 2019 infection prevention strategies.},

Abstract = {With the development of language research and language teaching, people
   realize that grammatical competence is an important part of
   communicative competence. In foreign language teaching, grammar teaching
   is not only necessary but also the main way to achieve the goal of
   communicative competence. This article mainly studies the virtual
   reality technology college English immersive context teaching method
   based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. The purpose is to
   improve students' English learning ability. Through the comparative
   teaching experiment of two classes of freshmen in a university, the
   experimental class conducted VR technology-based immersive virtual
   context teaching from the perspective of constructivism, while the
   control class adopted common multimedia equipment and traditional
   teaching methods. In the classroom, teachers occupy most of the time,
   students only passively receive a lot of information from teachers, they
   have little chance to participate in the exchange of information and
   express ideas in the target language, and most of the time they are
   ``immersed{''} in the Chinese environment. The overall English level was
   also better than that of the control class, with an average score of 2.8
   points higher. This shows that college English immersive context
   teaching combining constructivism theory and VR technology can indeed
   improve students' English level.},

Journal = {KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT RESEARCH \& PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JUL 30},
Abstract = {The aim is to optimise the procedures and reduce the workload of human
   resource management (HRM), thereby increasing the working efficiency and
   improving system performance. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are employed
   to build a CC neural network (BPNN)-based HRM system model. Then, this
   model is optimised and simulated, whose performance is verified through
   comparisons with other models. The comparative simulation demonstrates
   that the proposed system model converges the fastest. Results of the
   Leave-One-Out (LOO) method also prove the fastest convergence and the
   best optimisation effect of the proposed system model over classic
   models. In particular, it can converge at about 60 epochs and provides
   an accuracy of about 88.72\%, 2.76\% higher than other models at tops.
   Regarding the prediction performance, the proposed system model presents
   an excellent fitting effect. Through experiments, the constructed model
   converges faster and makes predictions more accurately, providing an
   experimental reference for the operation and intelligent development of
   HRM systems in the economic field in the future.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (Al) has been present in some guise within the
   field of radiology for over 50 years. The first studies investigating
   computer-aided diagnosis in thoracic radiology date back to the 1960s,
   and in the subsequent years, the main application of these techniques
   has been the detection and classification of pulmonary nodules. In
   addition, there have been other less intensely researched applications,
   such as the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease, and the detection of pulmonary emboli. Despite
   extensive literature on the use of convolutional neural networks in
   thoracic imaging over the last few decades, we are yet to see these
   systems in use in clinical practice. The article reviews current
   state-of-the-art applications of Al and in detection, classification,
   and follow-up of pulmonary nodules and how deep-learning techniques
   might influence these going forward. Finally, we postulate the impact of
   these advancements on the role of radiologists and the importance of
   radiologists in the development and evaluation of these techniques. (C)

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Rapid developments in educational technology in higher education are
   intended to make learning more engaging and effective. At the same time,
   cognitive load theory stresses limitations of human cognitive
   architecture and urges educational developers to design learning tools
   that optimise learners' mental capacities. In a 2-month study we
   investigated university students' learning with an AI-enriched digital
   biology textbook that integrates a 5000-concept knowledge base and
   algorithms offering the possibility to ask questions and receive
   answers. The study aimed to shed more light on differences between three
   sub-types (intrinsic, germane and extraneous) of cognitive load and
   their relationship with learning gain, self-regulated learning and
   usability perception while students interacted with the AI-enriched book
   during an introductory biology course. We found that students displayed
   a beneficial learning pattern with germane cognitive load significantly
   higher than both intrinsic and extraneous loads showing that they were
   engaged in meaningful learning throughout the study. A significant
   correlation between germane load and accessing linked suggested
   questions available in the AI-book indicates that the book may support
   deep learning. Additionally, results showed that perceived non-optimal

Title = {The Establishment of College Student Employment Guidance System
   Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Civic Education},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {A logical and appropriate job advising system for college students is
   the only way to address the current dire work scenario for recent
   graduates in a society that is becoming more and more competitive. The
   process of building new career advice systems for college students is
   still fraught with many major issues. Existing problems are manifested
   in the lack of a perfect employment guidance system for college students
   and a lack of effective ideological and political education, which leads
   to the inability of college students to establish a correct employment
   concept. At the same time, the recommendation method used in the current
   college student employment guidance system is not reasonable enough and
   only considers students' one-way preference for employment units. Then,
   the history of one user's employment is likely to lead to unreliable
   negative samples, which affects the recommendation performance. In
   addition, the current employment recommendation system cannot fully
   integrate the service function, management function, education function,
   and research function of the employment guidance system. In this paper,
   we address the aforementioned issues and propose an unique career
   counseling system for college students by combining algorithmic
   recommendation with ideological and political education. The system
   adaptively aggregates the preferences and needs of students and
   employers and fully integrates several functions of the student career
   competence and career guidance system. The experimental results show
   that the establishment of a college students' employment guidance system
   integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and civic education not only
   has better interpretability compared with the traditional employment
   guidance system but also has a higher area under curve (AUC).
   Furthermore, we also discuss the importance of ideological and political
   education and referral systems in the work of the career guidance system
   through ablation experiments. The results show that the AUC values of
   integrating ideological and political education and recommender systems
   were higher than those of integrating only ideological and political
   education or recommender systems. Therefore, establishing an employment
   guidance system for college students that integrates AI and civic
   education can effectively guide students' employment. At the same time,
   the college student employment guidance system proposed in this paper
   can offer employment guidance courses in colleges and universities, help
   graduates to solve their doubts, and make graduates adjust their
   psychological state in the process of job hunting.},

Abstract = {Deep learning has been employed to build applications and greatly
   promoted the devel-opment of the industries from many areas. Among the
   deep learning algorithms, normal equation method is widely used and is
   very time-consuming. Thus, it is very urgent to improve normal equa-tion
   method. First, we propose a systolic Gaussian elimination. Second, we
   propose a systolic Gauss-Jordan elimination. By integrating other
   designs, we build an efficient architecture for improving differential
   equations in normal equation method. We implement our design in the
   devel-opment environment of artificial intelligence, which shows that it
   is very efficient for deep learning and its applications. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {More than half of the universities have recently added advanced
   technical courses for their students. The specialised courses would be
   the backbone to keep the students' knowledge updated. In that case,
   artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) have been
   lightened up recently. This paper introduces the basic concepts of AI
   and VR and the changes that can be made when they are implemented in
   real-time applications. Students will be more focused on the courses
   utilising virtual reality. This VR makes the visualisation of any
   challenging course easier. Many students have been working on virtual
   reality in their colleges, and their involvement shows the actual output
   in the upcoming years. The research was carried on the Virtual Reality
   Driving Simulator Dataset to implement the virtual reality method. The
   results are compared to the real world and show that the proposed model
   is 98.67\% more accurate than the real world.},

Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Comprehensively improving the level of vocational education and teaching
   quality has become an important initiative to meet the new round of
   technological revolution and industrial change. The traditional teaching
   mode can no longer meet the needs of industries and enterprises for job
   competences, and all higher education institutions are actively thinking
   about how to carry out teaching reform. Virtual reality (VR) can
   effectively solve the above-mentioned drawbacks, but the hardware
   facilities of the existing VR systems are extremely expensive, making it
   impossible to popularize it in teaching. In this context, this paper is
   based on VR for the design of an interactive teaching platform. This
   paper discusses the key technologies of virtual reality, introduces the
   relevant theoretical foundation, and describes the current virtual
   reality devices with high popularity and their advantages and
   disadvantages for systematic analysis. From the perspective of teaching
   design, the design of human-computer interaction teaching process using
   VR technology to develop learning scenes is studied, introducing 3D
   modeling techniques, model construction, the production of picture and
   text panels, the production of video materials, and the establishment of
   virtual tour guide 3D scenes. The principle of this paper is to build a
   3D vision for building 3D views of educational needs to design high
   quality images and video animation using 3DMAX and unity 3D engines.
   Then, we introduce the use of VR glasses (entry-level), smart phones
   (android/ios), and Bluetooth wireless handle to build a simple
   interactive teaching platform; the platform is of low cost of
   construction and student coverage, to solve the teaching resources
   shortage, equipment conditions lagging behind, the curriculum content
   aging, teachers and students who cannot interact in real time, and a

Title = {Artificial intelligence-assisted air quality monitoring for smart city
   management},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {MAY 24},
Abstract = {Background. The environment has been significantly impacted by rapid
   urbaniza-tion, leading to a need for changes in climate change and
   pollution indicators. The 4IR offers a potential solution to efficiently
   manage these impacts. Smart city ecosys-tems can provide well-designed,
   sustainable, and safe cities that enable holistic climate change and
   global warming solutions through various community-centred initiatives.
   These include smart planning techniques, smart environment monitoring,
   and smart governance. An air quality intelligence platform, which
   operates as a complete mea-surement site for monitoring and governing
   air quality, has shown promising results in providing actionable
   insights. This article aims to highlight the potential of ma-chine
   learning models in predicting air quality, providing data-driven
   strategic and sustainable solutions for smart cities. Methods. This
   study proposed an end-to-end air quality predictive model for smart city
   applications, utilizing four machine learning techniques and two deep
   learning techniques. These include Ada Boost, SVR, RF, KNN, MLP
   regressor and LSTM. The study was conducted in four different urban
   cities in Selangor, Malaysia, including Petaling Jaya, Banting, Klang,
   and Shah Alam. The model considered the air qual-ity data of various
   pollution markers such as PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO. Additionally,
   meteorological data including wind speed and wind direction were also
   considered, and their interactions with the pollutant markers were
   quantified. The study aimed to determine the correlation variance of the
   dependent variable in predicting air pol-lution and proposed a feature
   optimization process to reduce dimensionality and re-move irrelevant
   features to enhance the prediction of PM2.5, improving the existing LSTM
   model. The study estimates the concentration of pollutants in the air
   based on training and highlights the contribution of feature
   optimization in air quality predic-tions through feature dimension
   reductions. Results. In this section, the results of predicting the
   concentration of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO) in the air are
   presented in R2 and RMSE. In predicting the PM10 and PM2.5
   concentration, LSTM performed the best overall high R2 values in the
   four study areas with the R2 values of 0.998, 0.995, 0.918, and 0.993 in
   Banting, Petaling, Klang and Shah Alam stations, respectively. The study
   indicated that among the studied pollution markers, PM2.5, PM10, NO2,
   wind speed and humidity are the most important elements to monitor. By
   reducing the number of features used in the model the proposed feature
   optimization process can make the model more interpretable and provide
   insights into the most critical factor affecting air quality. Findings
   from this study can aid policymakers in understanding the underlying
   causes of air pollution and develop more effective smart strategies for
   reducing pollution levels.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, the nextgeneration network
   (5G) has emerged. 5G can support a variety of new applications, such as
   the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of
   Vehicles. Most of these new applications depend on deep learning
   algorithms, which have made great advances in many areas of artificial
   intelligence (AI). However, researchers have found that AI algorithms
   based on deep learning pose numerous security problems. For example,
   deep learning is susceptible to a well-designed input sample formed by
   adding small perturbations to the original sample. This well-designed
   input with small perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans, is
   called an adversarial example. An adversarial example is similar to a
   truth example, but it can render the deep learning model invalid. In
   this article, we generate adversarial examples for spatiotemporal data.
   Based on the travel time estimation (TTE) task, we use two
   methods-white-box and blackbox attacks-to invalidate deep learning
   models. Experiment results show that the adversarial examples
   successfully attack the deep learning model and thus that AI security is
   a big challenge of 5G.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised in
   medical imaging systems and processes, and radiographers must embrace
   this advancement. This study aimed to investigate perceptions,
   knowledge, and expectations towards integrating AI into medical imaging
   amongst a sample of radiographers and determine the current state of AI
   education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online
   quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted
   over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information,
   participants' perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI
   and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential
   statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results:
   A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64\% correctly
   identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer
   (37\%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and
   deep learning. The majority of participants (83\%) agreed they were
   excited about the advancement of AI, though a level of apprehensiveness
   remained amongst 29\%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with
   only 8\% of participants having received AI teachings in their
   pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes
   towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may
   stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI
   training within the community. Greater educational programs focusing on
   AI principles are required to help increase European radiography
   workforce engagement and involvement in AI technologies. Implications
   for practice: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of
   European based radiographers on AI in radiography to help facilitate the
   embracement of AI technology and convey the need for AI-focused
   education within the profession. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study is to explore students' expectations and
   perceived effectiveness of computer-assisted review tools, and the
   differences in reliability and validity between human evaluation and
   automatic evaluation, to find a way to improve students' English writing
   ability. Design/methodology/approach Based on the expectancy
   disconfirmation theory (EDT) and Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language
   Learning (ICALL) theory, an experiment is conducted through the
   observation method, semistructured interview method and questionnaire
   survey method. In the experiment, respondents were asked to write and
   submit four essays on three online automated essay evaluation (AEE)
   systems in total, one essay every two weeks. Also, two teacher raters
   were invited to score the first and last papers of each student. The
   respondents' feedbacks were investigated to confirm the effectiveness of
   the AEE system; the evaluation results of the AEE systems and teachers
   were compared; descriptive statistics was used to analyze the
   experimental data. Findings The experiment revealed that the respondents
   held high expectations for the computer-assisted evaluation tools, and
   the effectiveness of computer scoring feedback on students was higher
   than that of teacher scoring feedback. Moreover, at the end of the
   writing project, the students' independent learning ability and English
   writing ability were significantly improved. Besides, there was a
   positive correlation between students' initial expectations of
   computer-assisted learning tools and the final evaluation of learning
   results. Originality/value The innovation lies in the use of observation
   methods, questionnaire survey methods, data analysis, and other methods
   for the experiment, and the combination of deep learning theory, EDT and
   descriptive statistics, which has particular reference value for future
   works.},

   direction in education: a case of ChatGPT and Midjourney},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 2},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become
   increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous
   ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In
   schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of
   innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to
   investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives
   of teachers and leaders. It used four domains - learning, teaching,
   assessment, and administration - as the initial framework suggested in a
   systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants
   were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They
   completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and
   Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis
   identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three
   suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite
   knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for
   policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They
   also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in
   education.},

Abstract = {The United Nations has set a Sustainable Development Goal in education
   to be met hopefully by 2030. One of the target areas is to substantially
   increase the number of youth and adults possessing training and
   proficiency relevant to the technical and vocational skills needed for
   employment, well-paying jobs, and decent entrepreneurships. Enrolled
   students need to be equipped with core competencies suitable for the
   fields in which they are specializing, including the field of
   translation. For student translators, ``transcreation{''} is a core
   competency they are expected to acquire and practice. With its
   increasing application in all sectors of life, the use of artificial
   intelligence or machine translation is on its way to becoming mainstream
   in the translation industry, eliminating bread-winning opportunities
   from translators, leaving them in the stream of life to sink or swim.
   That is why trainers of translators and practitioners alike insist that
   it is time to consider transcreation so that student translators can
   better embrace future challenges and boost their employability. A
   one-shot case study was adopted in this research. After a one-semester
   trial of teaching and practicing transcreation, an online questionnaire
   survey was administered to gain the overall perceptions of transcreation
   from the students. Findings show that the students have raised their
   awareness of transcreation as a novel approach to translation and most
   of them feel confident about their employability in the translation job
   market. Implications for translation syllabus design and translator
   training are also illustrated.},

Abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrated into existing
   technologies which has brought forth the fourth industrial and learning
   revolution, designing curriculum for AI education has become an
   important strategic development for education authorities throughout the
   world. Framed broadly from the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study
   examined a structural equational model to establish the
   interrelationships of students' perceived usefulness, attitude towards
   using AI, subjective norms to learn about AI, basic literacy about AI
   and their behavioral intention to learn about AI. In addition, it
   examines the moderation effects of readiness, social good, and optimism
   on the research model. The findings confirm the hypothesized model. In
   addition, various moderation effects were found among students'
   perception of readiness, social good, and optimism for AI. The
   implications of the study point towards the need to consider these
   factors in designing AI curriculum to foster students' behavioral
   intention to learn AI.},

Title = {Taylor, the Disability Disclosure Virtual Assistant: A Case Study of
   Participatory Research with Disabled Students},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Administrative burden in education is a serious issue for disabled
   students. Form-filling and bureaucracy are ubiquitous in further and
   higher education, particularly for students who need to disclose a
   disability and arrange for accommodations and support for an equitable
   educational experience. Paradoxically, many of these processes are
   inherently inaccessible for disabled students, and yet completing them
   can be critical to their success. Artificial Intelligence has potential
   to alleviate some of the burden imposed by administration and
   bureaucracy; virtual assistants and chatbots can replace forms with
   dialogue, without placing additional strain on institutions. However, it
   is essential that solutions are designed in partnership with disabled
   students to ensure that students' needs are met, their concerns
   addressed, and the final solution is equitable for them. This paper
   explores a case study of participatory research with disabled students
   in a large UK distance learning institution, in which participatory
   research identified an issue of administrative burden for disabled
   students, and a virtual assistant was designed as a solution using
   participatory design. It shares the methodology and design process,
   explores findings from different phases of the research, and shares
   recurrent themes arising throughout the study. In doing so, it aims to
   provide a foundation for future participatory research to reduce
   barriers for disabled students.},

Title = {Method to Produce More Reasonable Candidate Solutions With Explanations
   in Intelligent Decision Support Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {20861-20876},
Abstract = {The integration of Artificial Intelligence techniques into Decision
   Support Systems yields effective solutions to decision problems,
   especially when complex scenarios are at hand. However, the use of
   intelligent black-box models can hinder the decision support system's
   potential to be fully adopted because opaque processes raise suspicions
   and doubts among careful decision makers. Moreover, appropriate and
   comprehensible explanations may foster trustworthiness and allow for
   reasonable adjustments or even corrections. This work proposed an
   approach that incorporates three reasonability aspects into Decision
   Systems: feasibility, rationality, and plausibility. Thus, by providing
   decision makers with reasonable candidate solutions for a complex
   problem, they are expected to perform their tasks more effectively (i.e.
   decide with more efficiency as well as efficacy). The new approach is
   accompanied by two proofs of concept in the health and public security
   areas. Comparative results using random and rational approaches,
   including the simulation of distinct user profiles, are presented. The
   proposed approach achieved superior metrics with regard to feasibility
   and plausibility, suggesting that this proposition can be applied to
   real-world applications.},

Abstract = {The rapid and profound, changes in modern social life have caused great
   pressure on human psychology. The number of people undergoing
   psychological adjustment has increased, and some of them have serious
   physical and mental health problems due to psychological disorders.
   Research shows that college students are gradually becoming a group
   facing the risk of psychological crisis. College students are in an
   important transitional stage of life, their bodies and mind are becoming
   more and more mature, and their new life can easily make them
   psychologically dangerous. The article uses artificial intelligence to
   start with image resolution recognition, upscaling image sharpening,
   reconstruction-based higher resolution, and recognition-based higher
   resolution processing. The project aspires to solve development problems
   by researching recognition-based advanced solution techniques.
   Investigative experiments use questionnaires, interviews, case analysis,
   comparative analysis, action research, etc., to describe and analyze the
   current situation of college students' mental health education. On this
   basis, a guiding reflection on future development is carried out. The
   survey results show that 34.5\% of students in independent colleges feel
   inferior, and 28.7\% of students in ordinary colleges also feel
   inferior. Among ordinary college students, 59.6\% felt the burden of
   psychological problems.},

Title = {Analysis of Public Opinion in Colleges and Universities Based on
   Wireless Web Crawler Technology in the Context of Artificial
   Intelligence},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN 11},
Abstract = {Wi-Fi-enabled information terminals have become enormously faster and
   more powerful because of this technology's rapid advancement. As a
   result of this, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was born.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in a wide range of societal
   contexts. It has had a significant impact on the realm of education.
   Using big data to support multistage views of every subject of opinion
   helps to recognize the unique characteristics of each aspect and
   improves social network governance's suitability. As public opinion in
   colleges and universities becomes an increasingly important vehicle for
   expressing public opinion, this paper aims to explore the concepts of
   public opinion based on the web crawler and CNN (Convolutional Neural
   Network) model. Web crawler methodology is utilised to gather the data
   given by students of college and universities and mention them in
   different dimensions. This CNN has robust data analysis capability; this
   proposed model uses the CNN to analyse the public opinion. Preprocessing
   of data is done using the oversampling method to maximize the effect of
   classification. Through the association of descriptions, comprehensive
   utilization of image information like user influence, stances of
   comments, topics, time of comments, etc., to suggest guidance phenomenon
   for various schemes, helps to enhance the effectiveness and targeted
   social governance of networks. The overall experimentation was carried
   out in python here in which the suggested methodology was predicting the
   positive and negative opinion of the students over the web crawler
   technology with a low rate of error when compared to other existing
   methodology.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing and artificial intelligence are now widely used for
   classroom teaching in higher learning institutes. The digital teaching
   supported to ICT technologies in colleges serves as a central point for
   the advancement of modern education; and has become as a mode of
   instruction and an approach to teaching. Digital teaching has emerged as
   a major driving force in the advancement of digital economy and
   digitization of education in colleges. In this paper, we investigate the
   movable information management system utilized in the digital teaching
   using edge computing and 5G wireless communication technology.
   Furthermore, we explain the idea of a mobile data scheme and presents a
   teaching platform based on the edge computing and 5G-enabled wireless
   communication technology. The main objective of this work is to develop
   a digital teaching framework for college students that, in fact, enables
   digital teaching, the collection, and incorporation of teaching
   information, the provision of modern education, and sharing of
   resources. Cutting-edge technology advancements in the educational
   platform have the potential to improve 5G communication. To implement
   the cutting-edge technology, all types of technological devices, smart
   devices, and gadgets from the Internet of Things (IoT) platform are
   used. We evaluated the proposed system through reasonable assumptions
   and numerical simulations. The experimental results reveal that the
   suggested system has significantly improved the teaching efficiency with
   which digital teaching management is managed in colleges. Moreover, the
   edge and 5G technology can significantly improve the system performance,
   in terms of response time, that can be as high as 11.45\% when compared

Abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak was announced as a global pandemic by the World

   the ongoing fight toward reducing the impact of this global health
   crisis. In this study, potential use-cases of intelligent speech
   analysis for COVID-19 identification are being developed. By analyzing
   speech recordings from COVID-19 positive and negative patients, we
   constructed audio- and symptomatic-based models to automatically
   categorize the health state of patients, whether they are COVID-19
   positive or not. For this purpose, many acoustic features were
   established, and various machine learning algorithms are being utilized.
   Experiments show that an average accuracy of 80\% was obtained
   estimating COVID-19 positive or negative, derived from multiple cough
   and vowel /a/ recordings, and an average accuracy of 83\% was obtained
   estimating COVID-19 positive or negative patients by evaluating six

Title = {An Automated Virtual Reality Training System for Teacher-Student
   Interaction: A Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Shortages in qualified supervision and other resources
   prevent education personnel from rehearsing effective practices.
   Interactive simulations, although increasingly used in education,
   frequently require instructor management. Automated simulations rarely
   engage trainees in skills related to practice (eg, speech).
   Objective: We evaluated the capability of delivering behavioral skills
   training through an automated virtual reality (VR) simulation using
   artificial intelligence to improve the implementation of a nondirective
   mathematical questioning strategy.
   Methods: We recruited and randomly assigned 30 college-aged participants
   to equivalent treatment (ie, lecture, modeling, and VR; 15/30, 50\%) and
   control groups (ie, lecture and modeling only; 15/30, 50\%). The
   participants were blind to treatment conditions. Sessions and
   assessments were conducted face to face and involved the use of VR for
   assessment regardless of the condition. Lessons concerned the use of a
   nondirective mathematical questioning strategy in instances where a
   simulated student provided correct or incorrect answers to word
   problems. The measures included observed and automated assessments of
   participant performance and subjective assessments of participant
   confidence. The participants completed the pretest, posttest, and
   maintenance probes each week over the course of 3 weeks.
   Results: A mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of time
   (F-2,F-27=124.154; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.816) and treatment
   (F-1,F-28=19.281; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.408) as well as an interaction
   effect (F-2,F-28=8.429; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.231) for the average
   percentage of steps in the questioning procedure. Posttest scores for
   the intervention group (mean 88\%, SD 22.62\%) exceeded those of the
   control group (mean 63.33\%, SD 22.64\%), with t(28)=3.653, P<.001, and
   Cohen d=1.334. Maintenance scores indicated a positive effect of the
   intervention (mean 83.33\%, SD 24.40\%) relative to the control (mean
   54.67\%, SD 15.98\%), t(28)=3.807, P<.001, Cohen d=1.39. A Mann-Whitney
   U test indicated that the treatment groups' self-ratings of confidence
   (mean 2.41, SD 0.51) were higher than those of the control group (mean
   2.04, SD 0.52), U=64, P=.04, r=0.137.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate the potential of artificial
   intelligence-augmented VR to deliver effective, evidence-based training
   with limited instructor management. Additional work is needed to
   demonstrate the cascading effect of training on authentic practice and
   to encompass a wider range of skills.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Retinopathy screening via digital imaging is promising for
   early detection and timely treatment, and tracking retinopathic
   abnormality over time can help to reveal the risk of disease
   progression. We developed an innovative physician-oriented artificial
   intelligence-facilitating diagnosis aid system for retinal diseases for
   screening multiple retinopathies and monitoring the regions of potential
   abnormality over time.
   Approach: Our dataset contains 4908 fundus images from 304 eyes with
   image-level annotations, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related
   macular degeneration, cellophane maculopathy, pathological myopia, and
   healthy control (HC). The screening model utilized a VGG-based feature
   extractor and multiple-binary convolutional neural network-based
   classifiers. Images in time series were aligned via affine transforms
   estimated through speeded-up robust features. Heatmaps of retinopathy
   were generated from the feature extractor using gradient-weighted class
   activation mapping++, and individual candidate retinopathy sites were
   identified from the heatmaps using clustering algorithm. Nested
   cross-validation with a train-to-test split of 80\% to 20\% was used to
   evaluate the performance of the screening model.
   Results: Our screening model achieved 99\% accuracy, 93\% sensitivity,
   and 97\% specificity in discriminating between patients with retinopathy
   and HCs. For discriminating between types of retinopathy, our model
   achieved an averaged performance of 80\% accuracy, 78\% sensitivity,
   94\% specificity, 79\% F1-score, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70.
   Moreover, visualization results were also shown to provide reasonable
   candidate sites of retinopathy.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the capability of the proposed
   model for extracting diagnostic information of the abnormality and
   lesion locations, which allows clinicians to focus on patient-centered
   treatment and untangles the pathological plausibility hidden in deep
   learning models. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

Abstract = {The EU4ALL project (IST-FP6-034778) has developed a general framework to
   address the needs of accessible lifelong learning at Higher Education
   level consisting of several standards-based interoperable components
   integrated into an open web service architecture aimed at supporting
   adapted interaction to guarantee students' accessibility needs. Its
   flexibility has supported the project implementation at several sites
   with different settings and various learning management systems.
   Large-scale evaluations involving hundreds of users, considering diverse
   disability types, and key staff roles have allowed obtaining valuable
   lessons with respect to ``how to adopt or enhance eLearning
   accessibility{''} at university. The project was evaluated at four
   higher education institutions, two of the largest in Europe and two
   medium-sized. In this paper, we focus on describing the implementation
   and main conclusions at the largest project evaluation site (UNED),
   which was involved in the project from the beginning, and thus, in the
   design process, and a medium-sized university that adopted the EU4ALL
   approach (UPV). This implies dealing with two well-known open source
   learning environments (i.e. dotLRN and Sakai), and considering a wide
   variety of stakeholders and requirements. Thus the results of this
   evaluation serve to illustrate the coverage of both the approach and
   developments.},

Title = {A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN
   ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING AND LEARNING (2015-2021): WHAT ARE THE CURRENT
   EFFECTS?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {337-377},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study carried out a systematic review of the literature
   on artificial intelli-gence (AI) in English language teaching (ELT). The
   objective was to delineate the current research progress in the field
   and to further understand the chal-lenges.
   Background The study analyzed articles published between 2015 and 2021.
   Methodology The qualitative research method was employed. Five steps
   were taken to steer the review. 200 articles were scrutinized; 64 were
   retained.
   Contribution Prior research on AI in ELT has not investigated how the
   literature is progress-ing or what areas of AI are being covered.
   Without a holistic picture, some im-portant research findings could be
   missed. Understanding how studies on AI in ELT are designed and
   implemented will contribute to a greater understanding of the existing
   state of research.
   Findings Findings show that there is a promising future for AI in ELT.
   AI in ELT yielded positive results in terms of optimizing the English
   language skills, translation, assessment, recognition, attitude,
   satisfaction, etc. It was also found out that more and more articles on
   the topic are being published; the mixed research method is the most
   commonly used, higher education level is the most sampled, students as
   participants are the most sampled, and most studies developed novel
   AI-based systems. Various AI approaches have been identified in the
   re-viewed studies, including machine learning, neural network, support
   vector ma-chine, genetic algorithms, deep learning, decision tree,
   expert system, natural language processing, data mining, cloud
   computing, and edge computing. How-ever, AI in ELT is still in its
   infancy, where little research has been conducted and gaps in the
   literature are still present, especially in terms of inherent issues
   related to body language, gestures, expressions, emotions, translation,
   lack of elaborate description of teaching material used for learning
   driven by AI, uncer-tainties and vagueness with regards to what can be
   considered under the realm of AI, and most authors being outside of the
   ELT discipline.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers This
   literature review is likely to provide practitioners with an overview of
   the current adopted technology, research method, instruments and/or
   tools, educa-tional level, language skill, and the effects reported by
   the AI-based studies for designing effective systems for the use of AI
   in their ELT classrooms. Researchers need to conduct research on AI in
   ELT along with a detailed in-depth description of the methodology,
   research design, and the proposed sys-tems used to achieve AI in ELT.
   Furthermore, it is recommended that research-ers explore the efficiency
   of AI-based systems used in previous research and ensure their relevance
   and functionality. They are also required to provide in-depth analysis
   of the challenges inherent to systems that have been highlighted in the
   literature, which will maximize the potentials of these AI-based
   technolo-gies.
   Impact on Society The findings of this paper can provide visualization
   of research findings that could particularly benefit researchers,
   educators, and AI specialists who are in-volved in the study of the
   applications of AI in ELT.
   Future Research Future AI research needs to seriously include more
   detailed descriptions of the method in further research.},

Abstract = {In today's understanding, the universities are considered as service
   providers besides their institutional functions. Because the
   universities shape the future of the country via the services they
   provide, it is a necessity that their service quality must be assessed
   by using scientific analyses, and their service quality must be improved
   based on such scientific findings. The Generation Z, whose members are
   currently receiving university education carries unique features that
   distinguish them from the previous generations. When this fact is
   considered, it is understood that the constant research and monitoring
   of the learning environment of the Generation Z is important. In this
   study, as a result of a detailed literature search, a scale consisting
   of 7 dimensions and 36 indicators was developed in order to measure the
   higher education service quality of the Z generation. The validity and
   reliability tests of this scale are completed via the convergent and
   divergent validity analyses, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and
   Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Because the answers provided to the
   surveys reflect the personal evaluation of the participants, the Fuzzy
   Logic is employed, and the study is conducted by using the fuzzy
   modelling and fuzzy ranking. As a result of this study, the General
   Satisfaction Index is created, and improving recommendations are carried
   out based on the scores.},

Title = {USE OF MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR THE FORECAST OF STUDENT
   ACHIEVEMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Journal = {INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND LEARNING TOOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {82},
Number = {2},
Pages = {297-311},
Abstract = {The machine learning method, which is a sub-branch of artificial
   intelligence and which makes predictions with mathematical and
   statistical operations, is used frequently in education as in every
   field of life. Nowadays, it is seen that millions of data are recorded
   continuously, and a large amount of data accumulation has occurred.
   Although data accumulation increases exponentially, the number of
   analysts and their capabilities to process these data are insufficient.
   Although we live in the information age, it is more accurate to say that
   we live in the data age. By using stored and accumulated data, it is
   becoming increasingly essential to reveal meaningful relationships and
   trends and to make predictions for the future. It is important to
   analyze the data obtained from the education process and to evaluate the
   success of the students and the factors affecting success. These
   analyses may also contribute to future training activities. In this
   study, a data set, including socio-demographic variables of students
   enrolled in distance education at Hitit University, was used. The
   authors estimated the success of the students with demographic and
   social variables such as age, gender, city, family income, family
   education level. The primary purpose is to provide students with
   information about their estimated academic achievement at the beginning
   of the process. Thus, at the beginning of the education process,
   students' success can be increased by informing the students who are
   predicted to be unsuccessful. Diversification and enhancement of this
   data may also support other decision-making mechanisms in the training
   process. Additionally, the factors affecting students' academic success
   were researched, and the students' educational outcomes were evaluated.
   Prediction success was compared using various machine learning
   algorithms. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the
   Random Forest algorithm was more predictive of student achievement than
   others.},

Title = {Big data-driven english teaching for social media: a neural
   network-based approach},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 7},
Abstract = {Big data and intelligence artificial have greatly broadened the channels
   for people to acquire knowledge. The practical application of artificial
   intelligence technology in college English classrooms can not only help
   teachers prepare more scientific and advanced teaching plans, and also
   effectively improve the quality of college English teaching. In this
   paper, we employ deep neural networks to design a big data-driven
   English teaching improvement scheme. The proposed method can help
   teachers and students improve teaching strategies and assist students to
   learn more accurately and efficiently. First, we analyze the current
   deficiencies and reasons in English teaching. Second, we analyze the
   application of artificial intelligence in text corpus construction.
   Third, we use neural networks to design an intelligent face recognition
   system for teachers to improve the attendance rate. Forth, by analyzing
   the students' writing, we design a writing scoring method based on the
   neural network model, which can evaluate students' writing content.
   Finally, we experimentally evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed method in this paper.},

Title = {An Artificial Intelligence System for the Detection of Bladder Cancer
   via Cystoscopy: A Multicenter Diagnostic Study},
Journal = {JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE},

Abstract = {Background Cystoscopy plays an important role in bladder cancer (BCa)
   diagnosis and treatment, but its sensitivity needs improvement.
   Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few
   cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy
   Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.
   Methods In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6
   hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation,
   and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene
   parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the
   validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS
   and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy,
   sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
   and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the
   Clopper-Pearson method. Results The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS
   were 0.977 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and
   0.990 (95\% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.988),
   0.978 (95\% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95\% CI = 0.987 to 0.994)
   in different external validation sets. In the CAIDS vs urologists'
   comparisons, the CAIDS showed high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy =
   0.939, 95\% CI = 0.902 to 0.964; sensitivity = 0.954, 95\% CI = 0.902 to
   0.983) with a short latency of 12 seconds, much more accurate and
   quicker than the expert urologists. Conclusions The CAIDS achieved
   accurate BCa detection with a short latency. The CAIDS may provide many
   clinical benefits, from increasing the diagnostic accuracy for BCa, even
   for commonly misdiagnosed cases such as flat cancerous tissue (carcinoma
   in situ), to reducing the operation time for cystoscopy.},

Title = {Uncertainty-aware convolutional neural network for explainable
   artificial intelligence-assisted disaster damage assessment},
Journal = {STRUCTURAL CONTROL \& HEALTH MONITORING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Accurate damage assessment is a critical step in post-disaster risk
   assessment, mitigation, and recovery. Current practices performed by
   experts and reconnaissance teams in the form of field evaluation require
   considerable time and resources. Recent advances in remote sensing
   imagery, artificial intelligence (AI), and computer vision have enhanced
   automated and rapid disaster damage assessment. Recent literature has
   shown promising progress in AI-assisted aerial damage assessment.
   However, accounting for the uncertainty in the outcome for improved
   quantification of confidence and enhanced model explainability for human
   decision-makers remains one of the key challenges. Overlooking
   uncertainty can lead to erroneous decisions, especially in
   highly-consequential tasks such as damage assessment. The aim of this
   study is to develop uncertainty-aware deep learning models for the
   assessment of post-disaster damage using aerial imaging. Within the
   framework of variational Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo dropout
   sampling technique is used to propagate epistemic uncertainty in model
   predictions. With this stochastic setting, the model produces damage
   prediction labels with softmax as random variables, which helps quantify
   confidence in the model outcome using appropriate measures of
   uncertainty. Two networks are implemented and trained separately on two
   different disaster damage datasets consisting of unmanned aerial vehicle
   building footage as well as satellite-captured post-disaster imagery.
   The first network attains 59.4\% accuracy in building classification,
   and the second network gives an accuracy of 55.1\%. Results from
   uncertainty analysis, model confidence quantification, and analyzing
   model attention zone can lead to more explainable and risk-informed
   automated damage assessment outcomes using AI technology.},

Title = {Construction of the Teaching Quality Monitoring System of Physical
   Education Courses in Colleges and Universities Based on the Construction
   of Smart Campus with Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {With regard to the development of colleges and universities, ensuring
   the quality of education is the fundamental goal and main task of
   teaching daily management. With the continuous improvement of the
   application level of the Internet and other information technologies,
   the construction of smart campus in colleges and universities in China
   is rapidly advancing. This paper studies the construction and innovation
   strategy of the public sports quality monitoring system and discusses
   the changes in college students' sports quality after the introduction
   of smart campuses from the perspective of artificial intelligence and
   the creation of smart universities. In this paper, the field survey
   method and other research methods are combined to study, and in the
   process of data storage, SQL Server database platform is used to store
   the data. This study shows that the proportion of each element of
   physical state management has changed significantly before and after
   college entrance. According to the data, since the introduction of smart
   campus real name system identification, tracking data, and evaluation
   functions, the number of college students' physical exercise has
   increased significantly. The number of students with exercise plan in
   school 1 has increased from 70 to 222, and that of school 2 has
   increased from 49 to 199. Before the introduction, the students were
   very satisfied with the learning effect of physical education, which was
   40.12\% and increased to 45.70\% after the introduction. Before the
   introduction, the students were very satisfied with the sports
   equipment, which was 30.12\% before the introduction and increased to
   35.24\% after the introduction. Therefore, building a system for
   monitoring the quality of public sports in universities is very
   important for improving the quality of education in public sports in
   universities and plays an active role in promoting the physical and
   mental health of students.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have had significant recent
   successes in multiple fields. These fields and the fields of satellite
   remote sensing and NWP share the same fundamental underlying needs,
   including signal and image processing, quality control mechanisms,
   pattern recognition, data fusion, forward and inverse problems, and
   prediction. Thus, modern AI in general and machine learning (ML) in
   particular can be positively disruptive and transformational change
   agents in the fields of satellite remote sensing and NWP by augmenting,
   and in some cases replacing, elements of the traditional remote sensing,
   assimilation, and modeling tools. And change is needed to meet the
   increasing challenges of Big Data, advanced models and applications, and
   user demands. Future developments, for example, SmallSats and the
   Internet of Things, will continue the explosion of new environmental
   data. ML models are highly efficient and in some cases more accurate
   because of their flexibility to accommodate nonlinearity and/or
   non-Gaussianity. With that efficiency, ML can help to address the
   demands put on environmental products for higher accuracy, for higher
   resolution-spatial, temporal, and vertical, for enhanced conventional
   medium-range forecasts, for outlooks and predictions on subseasonal to
   seasonal time scales, and for improvements in the process of issuing
   advisories and warnings. Using examples from satellite remote sensing
   and NWP, it is illustrated how ML can accelerate the pace of improvement
   in environmental data exploitation and weather prediction-first, by
   complementing existing systems, and second, where appropriate, as an
   alternative to some components of the NWP processing chain from
   observations to forecasts.},

   of Engineering Certification},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},

Abstract = {The problems existing in the online education courses of engineering
   majors in colleges and universities are studied, and the online
   education platform under the background of engineering certification is
   designed and researched. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and
   wireless network technology are used in the in-depth study of online
   education courses. In terms of AI, the storage of data is specifically
   divided into three levels, namely, the source layer (operational data
   layer), the historical storage layer, and the data model layer. Data
   analysis includes the total number of data, spatial scope, and period,
   etc. The results show that the overall response time of the designed
   platform to the operation of university teachers and students is
   controlled within 3 s. The test results of two online education
   platforms show that the performance of the designed online education
   platform is relatively stable. It provides hardware support for online
   curriculum reform. In addition, in terms of the platform test pass rate,
   after many tests, the online education platform security test pass rate
   is above 98\%. In the end, these conclusions are drawn: AI technology
   and wireless network technology can effectively improve the performance
   of online education platforms. Meanwhile, this can also further improve
   the learning efficiency of online education courses for college
   engineering students.},

Abstract = {In recent years, most educational institutions have integrated digital
   technologies into their teaching-learning processes. Learning Management
   Systems (LMS) have gained increasing popularity, particularly in higher
   education, due to their ability to manage teacher-student interactions.
   These systems store valuable information which describes students'
   behaviour throughout a course. These data can be utilised to construct
   statistical models that represent learner behaviour within an online LMS
   platform. In this study, we aim to compare different sources of
   information and, more ambitiously, to provide insights into which source
   of information is most valuable for inferring student performance. The
   considered sets of information come from (i) the Moodle LMS; (ii)
   socio-economic data about students acquired from a survey; and (iii)
   subject marks achieved throughout the course. To determine the relevance
   of the incorporated information, we use artificial intelligence (AI)
   methods, and we report the importance measures of four state-of-the-art
   methods. Our findings indicate that the selected methodology is suitable
   for making inferences about student performance while also shedding
   light on model decisions through explainability.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {APR 8},
Abstract = {In order to solve the problems of poor physical fitness of college
   students and low efficiency of college sport venues' management, an
   intelligent sports management system based on deep learning technology
   is designed by using information technology and human-computer
   interaction under artificial intelligence. Based on the Browser/Server
   (B/S) structure, the intelligent sports management system is
   constructed. The basic framework of Spring Cloud is used to integrate
   the framework and components of each part, and a distributed
   microservice system is built. The artificial intelligence recommendation
   algorithm is used to analyze the user's age, body mass index (BMI), and
   physical health status, and recommend sports programs suitable for
   students, thus realizing the intelligent sports program recommendation
   function. At the same time, the recommendation algorithm is used to
   complete the course recommendation according to the students'
   preferences, teaching distance, opening time, course evaluation, and
   other indexes, and the course registration system is constructed; after
   the analysis of the entity and the relationship between the entities of
   the intelligent sports system, the database relational model of the
   system is designed with the entity relationship (E-R) diagram. The
   results of the functional test show that the system can run well. In
   conclusion, the sports training environment instructional system based
   on artificial intelligence and deep learning technology can meet the
   teaching needs of colleges, improve the sports' quality for college
   students, and promote psychological education.},

Title = {Home-Based Real-Time Abnormal Movement Detection System Deployed on
   On-Device Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {07},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {In response to the aging trend in society and to Human Augmentation
   beings for home-based activities, this paper proposes an Abnormal
   Movement Detection system, using the common athome movements of standing
   up and hand tremors while picking up items for abnormal movement
   verification. This can be easily applied in ordinary homes or long-term
   care institutions; for those living alone with limited resources, there
   is no longer any need to purchase expensive monitoring equipment to
   achieve improved quality of life. Therefore, this research collected and
   built the own dataset as the first important step of the study. The
   proposed Abnormal Movement Detection system is implemented by designing
   a deep learning network. Several issues, including the network
   architecture, the novel method of data augmentation and the scoring
   method of expanding the intervals between abnormality levels, are
   studied. For achieving the home-based real-time detection, there are
   four main contributions of this paper. The first is that a training
   dataset was collected and established: From this, the pathognomonic
   movement categories are easy to observe in home activities and geometric
   data augmentation can be used to improve the related home activity video
   collection. The second is the abnormal behavior detection architecture:
   This architecture has several important function blocks including
   detecting object, detecting action, inspecting abnormal movement and
   reminding event, using Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long
   Short-Term Memory (CNN + LSTM) as the core network for abnormal motion
   detection. With movement abnormality evaluation based on different
   levels, it can judge abnormal behaviors and conduct model training,
   performance evaluation and architecture optimization with both public
   domain datasets and the movement dataset collected in this research
   project. The third is the proliferation of new attributes in the videos:
   New attributes are added to the original videos through a Generative
   Adversarial Network (GAN), producing new training videos; the
   effectiveness of two different generation methods is evaluated. Finally,
   the algorithms developed in this paper are deployed on
   resource-constrained On-device Artificial Intelligence (AI). Activity
   videos from a total of 20 people were collected; in all, 53 videos of
   StandUp and 60 videos of PickUpItems were obtained to establish the
   training dataset. When CNN and LSTM network were added to Batch
   Normalization (BN), and Global Average Pooling (GAP) replaced Fully
   Connected (FC) layers, the accuracy rate reached 98.4\%. In terms of
   data augmentation, geometric transformations and GAN were used to
   estimate the performance. The experimental results showed that the
   geometric transformation using brightness adjustment had the highest
   accuracy rate of 98.6\%. Finally, the Softmax layer using
   Phi-Softmax-tan(.) function was shown to be the best method to expand
   the intervals between abnormality levels.},

Title = {Deep learning artificial intelligence framework for sustainable
   desiccant air conditioning system: Optimization towards reduction in
   water footprints},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {140},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Desiccant evaporative cooling systems pave the path towards energy and
   environmental sustainability in buildings especially; however, the
   direct evaporative coolers in such configurations result in high water
   con-sumption. The application of modern computational intelligence
   tools, including artificial intelligence and meta -heuristic
   optimization algorithms, can improve the operational comprehension of
   desiccant cooling systems while addressing the minimization of total
   water footprints with the maximization of the cooling capacity. The
   contribution/objective of this research is to address the gaps in
   understanding through the application of deep learning, genetic
   algorithm, and multicriteria decision analysis applied to a desiccant
   cooling system working under real transient experimental conditions of a
   building located in Austria. Within the methodology, cali-brated,
   experimental, and validated data monitoring system displaying the real
   desiccant-enhanced cooling system is adapted to generate a set of
   input-output data sets. The set of data includes ambient temperature,
   ambient humidity, regeneration temperature, supply airflow rate, and
   return airflow rate yielding the cooling capacity and total water
   footprints of the system. The results of deep learning algorithm using
   an artificial neural network have suggested that the architectures
   5-{[}6]-{[}6]-1 and 5-{[}12]-{[}12]-1 are the best to accurately predict
   the cooling capacity and total water footprints with a coefficient of
   determination of 0.98856 and 0.99246, respectively. Secondly, the
   ``white-box model{''} of the deep learning algorithm is used to develop
   a digital twin model which helps in the replication of the earlier
   experimental conditions. The optimization results have suggested that
   the optimized total water footprints are 45.17 kg/h with a system of
   3.32 tons of refrigeration. These optimal values are found in the best
   combination of design variables in which the ambient temperature is 28
   degrees C, ambient relative humidity is 52.0\%, supply airflow rate is
   2.13 kg/s, and regeneration flow rate is 2.35 kg/ s, and the
   regeneration temperature is 70.0 degrees C. It is concluded that the
   application of data-driven models can extend the interpretation of
   desiccant cooling systems and can participate in its performance
   enhancement.},

   learners},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Dropout is one of the major problems online higher education faces.
   Early identification of the dropout risk level and an intervention
   mechanism to revert the potential risk have been proved as the key
   answers to solving the challenge. Predictive modeling has been
   extensively studied on course dropout. However, intervention practices
   are scarce, sometimes mixed with mechanisms focused on course failure,
   and commonly focused on limited interventions driven mainly by teachers'
   experience. This work contributes with a novel approach for identifying
   course dropout based on a dynamic time interval and intervening,
   focusing on avoiding dropout at the assessable activity level. Moreover,
   the system can recommend the best interval for a course and assessable
   activity based on artificial intelligence techniques to help teachers in
   this challenging task. The system has been tested on a fully online
   first-year course with 581 participants from 957 enrolled learners of
   different degrees from the Faculty of Economics and Business at the
   Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. Results confirm that interventions
   aimed at goal setting on the ongoing assessable activity significantly
   reduce dropout issues and increase engagement within the course.
   Additionally, the work explores the differences between identification
   mechanisms for course dropout and failure aiming to distinguish them as
   different problems that learners may face.},

Abstract = {The construction of a correct worldview, outlook on life, and values for
   students is linked to the development and breakthrough in the management
   of ideological as well as political education of students. At the same

   is authoritative that efforts to integrate these two spheres of learning
   be extended and new encounters made. That's what prompted this study,
   which is focused on assessing college students' level of ideological and
   political education administration, and it uses a mixture of big data
   technologies as well as artificial intelligence (AI) to do it. The
   accuracy of the traditional ideological as well as political education
   management quality assessment algorithm is not high, feature information
   extracted by the single-scale neural network (NN) is not rich enough,
   and the multiscale convolutional network (CN) fusion cannot consider the
   different values and importance for each scale. In this paper, the
   convolution kernel of the two-dimensional CN is changed to a
   one-dimensional convolution kernel, and the multiscale feature fusion CN
   model MCNN is first designed. The model is optimized and improved, the
   attention mechanism is integrated, and the MACNN model for the
   management evaluation of ideological as well as political education is
   proposed. Besides, this work organizes the network model in a wireless
   network environment that users can contact and operate at any time.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND In-field triage tools for trauma patients are limited by
   availability of information, linear risk classification, and a lack of
   confidence reporting. We therefore set out to develop and test a machine
   learning algorithm that can overcome these limitations by accurately and
   confidently making predictions to support in-field triage in the first
   hours after traumatic injury. METHODS Using an American College of
   Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program-derived database of truncal
   and junctional gunshot wound (GSW) patients (aged 16-60 years), we
   trained an information-aware Dirichlet deep neural network (field
   artificial intelligence triage). Using supervised training, field
   artificial intelligence triage was trained to predict shock and the need
   for major hemorrhage control procedures or early massive transfusion
   (MT) using GSW anatomical locations, vital signs, and patient
   information available in the field. In parallel, a confidence model was
   developed to predict the true-class probability (scale of 0-1),
   indicating the likelihood that the prediction made was correct, based on
   the values and interconnectivity of input variables. RESULTS A total of
   29,816 patients met all the inclusion criteria. Shock, major surgery,
   and early MT were identified in 13.0\%, 22.4\%, and 6.3\% of the
   included patients, respectively. Field artificial intelligence triage
   achieved mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
   0.89, 0.86, and 0.82 for prediction of shock, early MT, and major
   surgery, respectively, for 80/20 train-test splits over 1,000 epochs.
   Mean predicted true-class probability for errors/correct predictions was
   0.25/0.87 for shock, 0.30/0.81 for MT, and 0.24/0.69 for major surgery.
   CONCLUSION Field artificial intelligence triage accurately identifies
   potential shock in truncal GSW patients and predicts their need for MT
   and major surgery, with a high degree of certainty. The presented model
   is an important proof of concept. Future iterations will use an
   expansion of databases to refine and validate the model, further adding
   to its potential to improve triage in the field, both in civilian and
   military settings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic, Level III.},

Abstract = {Recent trends in 5G and beyond wireless networks have encouraged the
   migration from the already congested radio frequency (RF) spectrum to
   higher frequency bands. In this context, the ubiquitous presence of
   lighting systems supports wide scale deployment of wireless
   communication links via light. However, the susceptibility of light to
   user mobility hinders its wide adoption. Hence, the coexistence of RF
   and light-based wireless communications has the potential to offer
   seamless heterogeneous network (HetNet) coverage through intelligent
   vertical handover policies in the presence of users' mobility. In this
   article, we first present new insights on the implementation of
   realistic indoor mobile optical channels and the impact of crowd
   mobility on relevant channel statistics. Then, an artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based framework for efficient resource management in
   mobile multi-user RF-light HetNets is proposed using a deep
   learning-empowered optical link predictor and a multiagent reinforcement
   learning-based link assignment strategy. The proposed AI-based framework
   helps to lay down the foundations of smart resource management in mobile
   multi-user HetNets.},

Title = {Research on the Innovation of Music Teaching in Universities Based on
   Artificial Intelligence Technology},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 30},
Abstract = {At present, music education in colleges is in a period of rapid
   development in China. At the same time, music education in universities
   is facing innovation and reform of teaching modes. How to improve music
   education in colleges and universities has become an important issue for
   music teachers in colleges. Music teaching and management activities for
   students in general universities can enrich students' talents and expand
   their knowledge. It can also help them develop a positive emotional
   psychology and develop positive and healthy character characteristics,
   both of which are vital for college students' healthy development.
   Innovation and modification in music teaching and management activities
   for students is the only way to increase the quality and effectiveness
   of music teaching for nonarts students and to promote the overall
   quality of students. Based on this, this paper proposes an innovative
   research method of college music teaching based on artificial
   intelligence technology. The method introduces a fuzzy evaluation
   algorithm to establish a two-level teaching evaluation index system and
   calculates the weights of each index based on fuzzy mathematical theory.
   In data processing, the SVM algorithm in the field of data mining is
   used to classify all collected teaching evaluation data in advance
   through supervised learning, which significantly improves the efficiency
   of data processing. The experimental results show that the model in this
   paper can well assess the quality of music teaching in colleges and
   universities and play a role in promoting the progress of music teaching
   in colleges and universities.},

Abstract = {Chest CT is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical
   management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) has the potential to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for
   differentiation of COVID-19 findings from other clinical entities. Here
   we show that a series of deep learning algorithms, trained in a diverse
   multinational cohort of 1280 patients to localize parietal pleura/lung
   parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, can achieve
   up to 90.8\% accuracy, with 84\% sensitivity and 93\% specificity, as
   evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training and
   validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from
   oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false
   positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non
   COVID-19) pneumonias was 10\%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify
   CT scans with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish
   non-COVID related pneumonias with high specificity in diverse patient

Title = {Towards cross-lingual voice cloning in higher education},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The rapid progress of modern AI tools for automatic speech recognition
   and machine translation is leading to a progressive cost reduction to
   produce publishable subtitles for educational videos in multiple
   languages. Similarly, text-to-speech technology is experiencing large
   improvements in terms of quality, flexibility and capabilities. In
   particular, state-of-the-art systems are now capable of seamlessly
   dealing with multiple languages and speakers in an integrated manner,
   thus enabling lecturer's voice cloning in languages she/he might not
   even speak. This work is to report the experience gained on using such
   systems at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV), mainly as a
   guidance for other educational organizations willing to conduct similar
   studies. It builds on previous work on the UPV's main repository of
   educational videos, MediaUPV, to produce multilingual subtitles at scale
   and low cost. Here, a detailed account is given on how this work has
   been extended to also allow for massive machine dubbing of MediaUPV.
   This includes collecting 59 h of clean speech data from UPV's academic
   staff, and extending our production pipeline of subtitles with a
   state-of-the-art multilingual and multi-speaker text-to-speech system
   trained from the collected data. Our main result comes from an
   extensive, subjective evaluation of this system by lecturers
   contributing to data collection. In brief, it is shown that
   text-to-speech technology is not only mature enough for its application
   to MediaUPV, but also needed as soon as possible by students to improve
   its accessibility and bridge language barriers.},

Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to perform in-depth research and analysis
   on the artificial intelligence coordination and optimization mechanism
   of college counseling student management using big data technology. This
   study places the collaborative ideological and political work of
   colleges and universities in the context of big data, and by analyzing
   its basic connotation and changes in the real situation, it explores the
   development progression of colleges and universities making full use of
   big data resources to cultivate a collaborative education model, which
   is conducive to promoting colleges and universities to cultivate a whole
   staff, whole process, and all-round accurate ideological education and
   value-led services and to shape excellent young college students with
   comprehensive growth. The first is to scientifically build a multilevel
   linked big data management platform for counselor professionalization
   construction, plan the technical architecture of the organizational
   platform, build a cloud database of counselor career files, and extract
   valuable information and data from the organizational activities at the
   macrolevel and personal activities at the microlevel with counselor
   professionalization construction activities; the second is to realize
   the integrated application of information resources for counselor team
   construction. The second is to realize the integrated application of
   counselor team construction information resources, visualise and
   accurately analyze and evaluate the counselor group's focus on career
   development and individual counselors' feedback on career capacity
   construction, and improve the overall construction, personalized
   education management level, and self-improvement development ability.
   Fourth, in the professionalization of counselors, attention should be
   paid to the scientific selection and prevention of risks of big data
   application, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of data and
   leakage prevention and control, etc.},

Title = {Automated Detection of Acute Myocardial Infarction Using Asynchronous
   Electrocardiogram Signals-Preview of Implementing Artificial
   Intelligence With Multichannel Electrocardiographs Obtained From
   Smartwatches: Retrospective Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: When using a smartwatch to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG)
   signals from multiple leads, the device has to be placed on different
   parts of the body sequentially. The ECG signals measured from different
   leads are asynchronous. Artificial intelligence (AI) models for
   asynchronous ECG signals have barely been explored.
   Objective: We aimed to develop an AI model for detecting acute
   myocardial infarction using asynchronous ECGs and compare its
   performance with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a
   commercial ECG analysis software. We sought to evaluate the feasibility
   of implementing multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on
   smartwatches. Moreover, we aimed to determine the optimal number of
   leads for sufficient diagnostic power.
   Methods: We extracted ECGs recorded within 24 hours from each visit to
   the emergency room of Ajou University Medical Center between June 1994
   and January 2018 from patients aged 20 years or older. The ECGs were
   labeled on the basis of whether a diagnostic code corresponding to acute
   myocardial infarction was entered. We derived asynchronous ECG lead sets
   from standard 12-lead ECG reports and simulated a situation similar to
   the sequential recording of ECG leads via smartwatches. We constructed
   an AI model based on residual networks and self-attention mechanisms by
   randomly masking each lead channel during the training phase and then
   testing the model using various targeting lead sets with the remaining
   lead channels masked.
   Results: The performance of lead sets with 3 or more leads compared
   favorably with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a
   commercial ECG analysis software, with 8.1\%-13.9\% gain in sensitivity
   when the specificity was matched. Our results indicate that multiple
   lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms can be implemented on smartwatches.
   Model performance generally increased as the number of leads increased
   (12-lead sets: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   {[}AUROC] 0.880; 4-lead sets: AUROC 0.858, SD 0.008; 3-lead sets: AUROC
   0.845, SD 0.011; 2-lead sets: AUROC 0.813, SD 0.018; single-lead sets:
   AUROC 0.768, SD 0.001). Considering the short amount of time needed to
   measure additional leads, measuring at least 3 leads-ideally more than 4
   leads-is necessary for minimizing the risk of failing to detect acute
   myocardial infarction occurring in a certain spatial location or
   direction.
   Conclusions: By developing an AI model for detecting acute myocardial
   infarction with asynchronous ECG lead sets, we demonstrated the
   feasibility of multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on
   smartwatches for automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. We also
   demonstrated the necessity of measuring at least 3 leads for accurate
   detection. Our results can be used as reference for the development of
   other AI models using sequentially measured asynchronous ECG leads via
   smartwatches for detecting various cardiac disorders.},

Title = {Development of a field artificial intelligence triage tool: Confidence
   in the prediction of shock, transfusion, and definitive surgical therapy
   in patients with truncal gunshot wounds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY},

Abstract = {Supplemental digital content is available in the text.
   BACKGROUNDIn-field triage tools for trauma patients are limited by
   availability of information, linear risk classification, and a lack of
   confidence reporting. We therefore set out to develop and test a machine
   learning algorithm that can overcome these limitations by accurately and
   confidently making predictions to support in-field triage in the first
   hours after traumatic injury.METHODSUsing an American College of
   Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program-derived database of truncal
   and junctional gunshot wound (GSW) patients (aged 16-60 years), we
   trained an information-aware Dirichlet deep neural network (field
   artificial intelligence triage). Using supervised training, field
   artificial intelligence triage was trained to predict shock and the need
   for major hemorrhage control procedures or early massive transfusion
   (MT) using GSW anatomical locations, vital signs, and patient
   information available in the field. In parallel, a confidence model was
   developed to predict the true-class probability (scale of 0-1),
   indicating the likelihood that the prediction made was correct, based on
   the values and interconnectivity of input variables.RESULTSA total of
   29,816 patients met all the inclusion criteria. Shock, major surgery,
   and early MT were identified in 13.0\%, 22.4\%, and 6.3\% of the
   included patients, respectively. Field artificial intelligence triage
   achieved mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
   0.89, 0.86, and 0.82 for prediction of shock, early MT, and major
   surgery, respectively, for 80/20 train-test splits over 1,000 epochs.
   Mean predicted true-class probability for errors/correct predictions was
   0.25/0.87 for shock, 0.30/0.81 for MT, and 0.24/0.69 for major
   surgery.CONCLUSIONField artificial intelligence triage accurately
   identifies potential shock in truncal GSW patients and predicts their
   need for MT and major surgery, with a high degree of certainty. The
   presented model is an important proof of concept. Future iterations will
   use an expansion of databases to refine and validate the model, further
   adding to its potential to improve triage in the field, both in civilian
   and military settings.LEVEL OF EVIDENCEPrognostic, Level III.},

   evolution of traditional teaching. Students have different corresponding
   relationships under digital behavior. The interactive technology of
   artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) provides a new
   driving force for the development of art education and psychology.
   Firstly, this thesis analyzes the limitations and existing problems of
   traditional art education. Especially, the influence of the teaching
   mode of art education on the teaching of other disciplines develops a
   targeted student-centered digital education program. Secondly, the
   author used VR equipment and technology to let students experience the
   virtual world freely, and then, the relevant data model was established
   on the basis of analyzing the reasons affecting students' creativity and
   concentration. Thirdly, the data model was applied to art education in
   order to improve students' concentration and creativity. Then, the
   author compared and analyzed the data of the students under different
   teaching models through questionnaires. The results show that
   introducing VR and AI technology into art education and encouraging
   students to carry out deep learning can significantly improve student
   concentration and creativity. Finally, the influence reasons are
   analyzed from the perspective of psychology. VR interaction and
   Artificial Intelligence can be introduced into middle school fine art
   education which is to the benefit of students' deep learning, thus
   students' concentration and creativity can be improved.},

Abstract = {The article aimed to predict the academic performance of students of
   master's degrees in education, having as main authors Camborda Zamudio
   (2014), Candia Oviedo (2019), Castrillon et al (2020), Hussain et al.
   (2018), Yarleque Wong (2019). The decision tree technique and data
   mining and tools provided by artificial intelligence were used to build
   a model with the J48 algorithm of the WEKA software, considering
   educational, family, socioeconomic, habits, and customs factors. The
   sample consisted of 237 students from a public university in Peru,
   obtaining a level of success through Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 66\%.
   The results show a methodology capable of training a system to classify
   a student based on one of the academic performance categories. This
   classification can a priori identify students with possible academic
   performance problems. As a result, accompanying and mitigation measures
   can be implemented immediately.},

Abstract = {Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while
   learning concurrently in real time. Before an artificial neural network
   (ANN) can execute a signal-processing program, it must first be
   programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data
   set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high
   power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing
   environments. In this work, a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors
   (synstors) is reported, each synstor integrating a Si channel with an Al
   oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual
   synstors are characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent
   signal-processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training,
   synstor circuits concurrently execute signal processing and learning in
   real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically
   changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning
   speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the
   environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The
   synstor circuit provides a path to establish power-efficient intelligent
   systems with real-time learning and adaptability in the capriciously
   mutable real world.},

Title = {Human Resource Petri Net Allocation Model Based on Artificial
   Intelligence and Neural Network},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {AUG 28},
Abstract = {The reasonable allocation and use of human resources is an important
   content in the process of complex system analysis and design. This paper
   studies the human resource allocation model of Petri net based on
   artificial intelligence and neural network. In this paper, combined with
   the characteristics of human resource scheduling, human resource
   mobility, concurrency, and obvious classification characteristics, the
   human resource allocation model based on Petri net is implemented. In
   this paper, the model is trained with the python version of human
   resource analysis data set. The training parameters are 100, the error
   coefficient is 0.001, and the learning speed is 0.01. First, the coding
   rules of human resource data are established. Then, the parameters are
   input into the model, and the human resource data are trained in the
   model. Finally, the results of the model output layer are analyzed. The
   research study shows that the average prediction accuracy of this model
   is 78.85\%. Model training requires the addition of 25 neurons for every
   0.01 increase to improve the accuracy of predicting dynamic data of
   human resources. If the accuracy rate exceeds 75\%, the increase in the
   number of neurons cannot be compensated for by the increase in the
   accuracy rate, but it is most efficient when the amount of data for
   human resource scheduling is 2000 to 4000. Therefore, this system can
   effectively allocate small- and medium-sized human resources and has a
   high accuracy.},

   Intelligence},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {The main objective of this work is to construct and evaluate the
   transformation mode of scientific and technological achievements in
   colleges and under the background of the wireless network for which an
   artificial intelligence backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model is
   utilized. Firstly, the work introduces the transformation mode of
   scientific and technological achievements. Secondly, the work
   establishes the evaluation system of the transformation mode of
   scientific and technological achievements in colleges and describes the
   steps of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and analytic hierarchy
   process (AHP) in detail. Thirdly, it determines the weight value of the
   evaluation indexes of the transformation of scientific and technological
   achievements in colleges and conducts the consistency and fuzzy
   comprehensive evaluation of these evaluation indexes. Finally, to
   further verify the scientificity and practicality of the index system,
   an artificial intelligence BPNN model is implemented to further evaluate
   the system. It is evident from the results that FCE of the
   transformation level of scientific and technological achievements in
   colleges shows that the excellent credibility accounts for 32.73\%, the
   good accounts for 53.24\%, the medium accounts for 14.33\%, and the poor
   is 0. The transformation of scientific and technological achievements in
   colleges is generally at the upper-medium level. The calculation of the
   weight of the indicators indicates that all the indicators established
   greatly impact the transformation mode of scientific and technological
   achievements in colleges. The results of the BPNN model show that the
   learning and prediction ability of the evaluation model has reached a
   high level, which verifies the scientificity and practicality of the
   evaluation index system. The exploration provides a reference basis for
   the construction and evaluation of the transformation model of
   scientific and technological achievements in colleges.},

Title = {Factors Influencing Analysis for Level of Engineering English Education
   Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {The essence of English for engineering is English for professional
   purposes (ESP). The assessment of the level of education in engineering
   English classrooms is one of the key issues currently being discussed in
   all schools. While the traditional English classroom teaching model has
   been criticized due to many problems, the changes in the new English
   curriculum and the changes in the assessment methods have also created
   new demands on the English teaching methods. The artificial intelligence
   technology brings a new direction for the optimization of English
   classroom, and it also provides new support for the realization of
   intelligent and collaborative English classroom teaching. In view of the
   current situation that the college English teaching evaluation mode is
   still dominated by summative evaluation, this paper summarizes the
   current problems of poor teaching effect, unbalanced ability
   cultivation, and mismatch between evaluation and teaching in engineering
   English. On this basis, it adopts the BPNN network combined with the
   interactive mechanism of English teaching to establish a
   multi-dimensional interactive English learning framework of teacher,
   student, corpus, and AI resource base. And the BPNN algorithm process
   was optimized using the gray wolf algorithm to improve the engineering
   English teaching model. Finally, an experiment on teaching engineering
   English was conducted within a university, and the experimental results
   showed that teaching objectives, teaching contents, teaching methods,
   and teaching effects had important effects on teaching effectiveness. In
   addition, the teaching framework constructed using the improved BPNN
   algorithm was better in terms of the learning effect at the same time,
   especially in writing, during the teaching process. Finally, the
   experimental results show that BPNN optimized by gray wolf algorithm can
   achieve better teaching effect than BPNN.},

Title = {Do AI chatbots improve students learning outcomes? Evidence from a
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 3},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are gaining increasing popularity
   in education. Due to their increasing popularity, many empirical studies
   have been devoted to exploring the effects of AI chatbots on students'
   learning outcomes. The proliferation of experimental studies has
   highlighted the need to summarize and synthesize the inconsistent
   findings about the effects of AI chatbots on students' learning
   outcomes. However, few reviews focused on the meta-analysis of the
   effects of AI chatbots on students' learning outcomes. The present study
   performed a meta-analysis of 24 randomized studies utilizing Stata
   software (version 14). The main goal of the current study was to
   meta-analytically examine the effects of AI chatbots on students'
   learning outcomes and the moderating effects of educational levels and
   intervention duration. The results indicated that AI chatbots had a
   large effect on students' learning outcomes. Moreover, AI chatbots had a
   greater effect on students in higher education, compared to those in
   primary education and secondary education. In addition, short
   interventions were found to have a stronger effect on students' learning
   outcomes than long interventions. It could be explained by the argument
   that the novelty effects of AI chatbots could improve learning outcomes
   in short interventions, but it has worn off in the long interventions.
   Future designers and educators should make attempt to increase students'
   learning outcomes by equipping AI chatbots with human like avatars,
   gamification elements and emotional intelligence.},

Title = {A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Model for Predicting the Strength of
   Foam-Cemented Paste Backfill},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {84569-84583},
Abstract = {Foam-cemented paste backfill (FCPB) has become a trend to solve the
   problem of roof-contacted filling. In order to solve the time-consuming
   and labor-intensive disadvantages of laboratory uniaxial compressive
   strength (UCS) tests, a hybrid artificial intelligence model which
   combines random forest (RF) algorithm and grid search optimizer (GSO)
   was proposed for FCPB strength prediction. Moreover, the effects of
   foaming agent on cement hydration and pore structure characteristics
   were studied. The results showed that GSO can effectively tune the
   hyper-parameters of the proposed GSO-RF model and the developed model is
   an efficient and accurate tool to predict the UCS for FCPB. Though the
   foaming agent will not change the influence trend of cement-tailings
   ratio, solid content and curing time, the influence degree will be
   weakened by the foaming agent. The ranking of the relative importance of
   influencing variables is: cement-tailings ratio > curing time > foaming
   agent dosage > solid content. In addition, the foaming agent has no
   significant effect on the hydration of cement. The foaming agent mainly
   changes the strength by changing the pore structure characteristics
   (especially the large pore volume). This research can provided some
   guidance for developing UCS prediction model for FCPB.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tools: utilizing a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to assess periodontal bone level radiographically-a
   retrospective study},
Journal = {BMC ORAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Background The purpose of this investigation was to develop a
   computer-assisted detection system based on a deep convolutional neural
   network (CNN) algorithm and to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of
   this system for the detection of alveolar bone loss in periapical
   radiographs in the anterior region of the dental arches. We also aimed
   to evaluate the usefulness of the system in categorizing the severity of
   bone loss due to periodontal disease. Method A data set of 1724
   intraoral periapical images of upper and lower anterior teeth in 1610
   adult patients were retrieved from the ROMEXIS software management
   system at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Using
   a combination of pre-trained deep CNN architecture and a self-trained
   network, the radiographic images were used to determine the optimal CNN
   algorithm. The diagnostic and predictive accuracy, precision, confusion
   matrix, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen
   Kappa, were calculated using the deep CNN algorithm in Python. Results
   The periapical radiograph dataset was divided randomly into 70\%
   training, 20\% validation, and 10\% testing datasets. With the deep
   learning algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy for classifying normal
   versus disease was 73.0\%, and 59\% for the classification of the levels
   of severity of the bone loss. The Model showed a significant difference
   in the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, MCC and
   Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen Kappa, and receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC), between both the binary and
   multi-classification models. Conclusion This study revealed that the
   deep CNN algorithm (VGG-16) was useful to detect alveolar bone loss in
   periapical radiographs, and has a satisfactory ability to detect the
   severity of bone loss in teeth. The results suggest that machines can
   perform better based on the level classification and the captured
   characteristics of the image diagnosis. With additional optimization of
   the periodontal dataset, it is expected that a computer-aided detection
   system can become an effective and efficient procedure for aiding in the
   detection and staging of periodontal disease.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in women worldwide.
   In recent decades, earlier diagnosis and better adjuvant therapy have
   substantially improved patient outcome. Diagnosis by histopathology has
   proven to be instrumental to guide breast cancer treatment, but new
   challenges have emerged as our increasing understanding of cancer over
   the years has revealed its complex nature. As patient demand for
   personalized breast cancer therapy grows, we face an urgent need for
   more precise biomarker assessment and more accurate histopathologic
   breast cancer diagnosis to make better therapy decisions. The
   digitization of pathology data has opened the door to faster, more
   reproducible, and more precise diagnoses through computerized image
   analysis. Software to assist diagnostic breast pathology through image
   processing techniques have been around for years. But recent
   breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to fundamentally
   change the way we detect and treat breast cancer in the near future.
   Machine learning, a subfield of AI that applies statistical methods to
   learn from data, has seen an explosion of interest in recent years
   because of its ability to recognize patterns in data with less need for
   human instruction. One technique in particular, known as deep learning,
   has produced groundbreaking results in many important problems including
   image classification and speech recognition. In this review, we will
   cover the use of AI and deep learning in diagnostic breast pathology,
   and other recent developments in digital image analysis.},

Abstract = {The quality of input data in deep learning is tightly associated with
   the ultimate performance of the machine learner. Taking advantage of the
   unique merits of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) methodology in
   the collection and construction of a database (e.g., abundant intrinsic
   fingerprint information, noninvasive data acquisition process, strong
   anti-interfering ability, etc.), herein we set up a SERS-based database
   of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), suitable for artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based sensing applications. The database is collected and analyzed
   by silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)-decorated silicon wafer (Ag NPs@Si)
   SERS chip, followed by training with a deep neural network (DNN). As
   proof-of-concept applications, three kinds of representative tumor
   suppressor genes, i.e., p16, p21, and p53 fragments, are readily
   discriminated in a label-free manner. Prominent and reproducible SERS
   spectra of these DNA molecules are collected and employed as input data
   for DNN learning and training, which enables selective discrimination of
   DNA target(s). The accuracy rate for the recognition of specific DNA
   target reached 90.28\%.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of Web Multimedia Teaching Evaluation System
   Based on Artificial Intelligence and jQuery},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {It is an important reflection of modern education and an overwhelming
   way to strengthen the quality of teaching. In the current environment,
   the traditional multimedia classroom management model can no longer
   adapt to the current rapidly developing network environment. How to
   manage more and more campus multimedia classrooms is an urgent problem
   to be solved. The informatization construction and application of
   multimedia classrooms is the key to the realization of educational
   informatization. The traditional multimedia classroom management model
   has not been able to adapt to the rapidly developing network
   environment, which is mainly manifested in the following aspects:
   electronic education management personnel cannot discover and process
   teaching in a timely manner. Equipment failure has not formed a set of
   standard troubleshooting procedures and cannot accurately record the
   status, use time, and maintenance records of various teaching pieces of
   equipment. This will not only affect the teaching quality of colleges
   and universities but also slow down the process of education
   informatization. This paper develops a web-based multimedia teaching
   equipment management system based on artificial intelligence and jQuery,
   which realizes the centralized control and management of various
   multimedia teaching equipment. According to the actual needs of
   multimedia teaching, this paper follows the design and development of
   software engineering, using artificial intelligence, jQuery, Ajax, and
   Spring MVC technology to design and develop a web-based multimedia
   teaching equipment management system. On the basis of realizing the
   centralized control and management of multiple multimedia teaching
   equipment, it can also track and record the use status and maintenance
   content of the multimedia teaching equipment to form an information
   knowledge base of the multimedia equipment, which is convenient for
   later maintenance and management. Through the use of this system,
   management can be systematized, standardized, and automated, reducing
   the tedious workload of management and maintenance personnel. It can
   speed up the information management process of multimedia teaching
   equipment and improve the work efficiency of related managers. A course
   can be studied online, and an online teaching system has been developed.
   According to our survey on Mandarin online course training in Northwest
   China (N=343), we found that 81.6\% of samples are satisfied with the
   Mandarin online training courses; 21.6\% think that they have learned
   new teaching methods/teaching concepts from the teacher through the
   Mandarin training; 36.2\% think that they have learned the theoretical
   knowledge of Mandarin through the Mandarin training. Gender, age,
   ethnicity, and learning experience are related to the difficulty of
   learning Mandarin online courses. Therefore, we can satisfy learners of
   different ages, learning foundations, and cultural backgrounds by
   designing different online course patterns, so as to enhance the
   high-quality promotion of Mandarin.},

   Decision Support},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The rapid development of wireless communication technology has caused
   the computing speed and performance of information terminals to increase
   exponentially. Artificial intelligence technology emerged in this
   context. As an efficient work system, artificial intelligence has been
   introduced into many areas of social life. Especially in the field of
   education, it has made outstanding contributions. At this stage, the
   conflict between Eastern and Western civilizations is intensifying. As
   the most active ideological group, college students have not yet formed
   a scientific understanding of the pros and cons of Eastern and Western
   civilizations, and it is easy for them to fall into confusion in this
   kind of ideological turmoil. This requires that the ideological and
   political education in our country's colleges and universities
   effectively play a role, strengthen ideological guidance, and create a
   new system of practical teaching of college ideological and political
   theory courses under the background of wireless communication.
   Ideological and political education, as one of the courses with
   outstanding characteristics in our country's university education
   courses, has a guiding role that cannot be ignored for university
   students. This paper uses a questionnaire survey method to conduct an
   online survey of 500 college students from 6 universities in Shanghai to
   obtain first-hand information on the current ideological and political
   practice courses of Chinese universities and then sort out the emergence
   of artificial intelligence-based decision support systems in China. The
   practical class encountered difficulties and explored strategies to
   alleviate this dilemma, hoping to provide a useful reference for the
   development of ideological and political teaching in China in the
   future.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {4186-4195},
Abstract = {The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the education sector
   to extensively use digital technologies in imparting education and in
   students' assessment. The integration of Information and Communication
   Technologies (ICT) has been put to the test. With the use of ICT,
   flexible education is an upcoming option to assist uniform, accessible,
   and innovative educational systems. While learning in such a covid
   scenario technical constraints, use of appropriate devices,
   uninterrupted network and bandwidth have created challenges in student
   progression and the teaching-learning process. The goal of this research
   is to determine the impact of digital technology on student growth and
   to investigate the factors that influence it. The usage of digital
   technology in teaching/learning before and amidst the spread of pandemic
   have been compared to appropriately assess the implications of these
   unique educational circumstances in student progression. The study's
   goal is to determine how digital technology affects student performance.
   Secondary data was used in conjunction with survey methods. Researchers
   have also studied the various platforms used in imparting education as
   well as in assessment. A questionnaire with self-reporting instruments
   and a scale for describing student progress through continuous
   evaluation with ICT was used. Evidence from secondary data reveals that
   despite facing many challenges during covid, students have shown
   considerable improvements and progress. Though the exams used artificial
   intelligence-based algorithms for proctoring, there exist loopholes and
   huge dependency on tools required and bandwidth to support efficient
   assessment during the examination. The suggestions and recommendations
   are made to enhance current online teaching methods to reach a larger
   number of students and to enrich the teaching/learning experience to
   ensure better student progression.},

Title = {Data science pedagogical tools and practices: A systematic literature
   review},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 24},
Abstract = {The development of data science curricula has gained attention in
   academia and industry. Yet, less is known about the pedagogical
   practices and tools employed in data science education. Through a
   systematic literature review, we summarize prior pedagogical practices
   and tools used in data science initiatives at the higher education
   level. Following the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK)
   framework, we aim to characterize the technological and pedagogical
   knowledge quality of reviewed studies, as we find the content presented
   to be diverse and incomparable. TPACK is a universally established
   method for teaching considering information and communication
   technology. Yet it is seldom used for the analysis of data science
   pedagogy. To make this framework more structured, we list the tools
   employed in each reviewed study to summarize technological knowledge
   quality. We further examine whether each study follows the needs of the
   Cognitive Apprenticeship theory to summarize the pedagogical knowledge
   quality in each reviewed study. Of the 23 reviewed studies, 14 met the
   needs of Cognitive Apprenticeship theory and include hands-on
   experiences, promote students' active learning, seeking guidance from
   the instructor as a coach, introduce students to the real-world industry
   demands of data and data scientists, and provide meaningful learning
   resources and feedback across various stages of their data science
   initiatives. While each study presents at least one tool to teach data
   science, we found the assessment of the technological knowledge of data
   science initiatives to be difficult. This is because the studies fall
   short of explaining how students come to learn the operation of tools
   and become proficient in using them throughout a course or program. Our
   review aims to highlight implications for practices and tools used in
   data science pedagogy for future research.},

Title = {Interpretable Dropout Prediction: Towards XAI-Based Personalized
   Intervention},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 14},
Abstract = {Student drop-out is one of the most burning issues in STEM higher
   education, which induces considerable social and economic costs. Using
   machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk
   of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there
   has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable
   machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
   tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian
   university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational
   stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine
   learning models - such as the CatBoost classifier - can efficiently
   identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement
   measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such
   as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and
   SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both
   globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great
   opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the
   right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the
   results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education
   stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful.},

Title = {The Predictive Capabilities of Artificial Intelligence-Based OCT
   Analysis for Age-Related Macular Degeneration Progression-A Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {DIAGNOSTICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The era of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our daily
   lives and AI has become a powerful force that is gradually transforming
   the field of medicine. Ophthalmology sits at the forefront of this
   transformation thanks to the effortless acquisition of an abundance of
   imaging modalities. There has been tremendous work in the field of AI
   for retinal diseases, with age-related macular degeneration being at the
   top of the most studied conditions. The purpose of the current
   systematic review was to identify and evaluate, in terms of strengths
   and limitations, the articles that apply AI to optical coherence
   tomography (OCT) images in order to predict the future evolution of
   age-related macular degeneration (AMD) during its natural history and
   after treatment in terms of OCT morphological structure and visual
   function. After a thorough search through seven databases up to 1
   January 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
   and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 1800 records were identified.
   After screening, 48 articles were selected for full-text retrieval and
   19 articles were finally included. From these 19 articles, 4 articles
   concentrated on predicting the anti-VEGF requirement in neovascular AMD
   (nAMD), 4 articles focused on predicting anti-VEGF efficacy in nAMD
   patients, 3 articles predicted the conversion from early or intermediate
   AMD (iAMD) to nAMD, 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to
   geographic atrophy (GA), 1 article predicted the conversion from iAMD to
   both nAMD and GA, 3 articles predicted the future growth of GA and 3
   articles predicted the future outcome for visual acuity (VA) after
   anti-VEGF treatment in nAMD patients. Since using AI methods to predict
   future changes in AMD is only in its initial phase, a systematic review
   provides the opportunity of setting the context of previous work in this
   area and can present a starting point for future research.},

Abstract = {With the promotion and development of artificial intelligence, the
   computer major has become a hot major in innovation and entrepreneurship
   education. It is increasingly essential to carry out a refined
   evaluation of creativity and venture education to achieve professional
   differentiation. The purpose of this paper is to study and explore the
   innovative use of AI in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship of
   college students in Internet universities. In the article, AI is first
   introduced. AI is inherently a novel instrument of human praxis, a tool
   of productivity that embodies human ability and volition. Then we
   analyze the innovation and venture education on the ground of the BP
   neural network, and finally, we conduct an empirical study on the
   innovation and venture on the ground of the BP neural network.
   Innovation and entrepreneurship refer to entrepreneurial activities
   based on one or several innovations in technological innovation, product
   innovation, brand innovation, service innovation, business model
   innovation, management innovation, organizational innovation, market
   innovation, and channel innovation. The report analyzes the influencing
   factors of creative venture education and designs an evaluation model of
   creative venture education. The test shows that the output of the BP
   neural network is the actual value, the real worth is reasonable, and
   the desired worth is also reasonable. The maximum error between the two
   is 1.64\%. The results tend to be generally satisfactory. The BP neural
   network model can highly generalize students' creative venture
   abilities, increasing the practical application value and research scope
   of BP neural networks.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence deep learning for 3D IC reliability prediction},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) technologies have been
   receiving much attention recently due to the near-ending of Moore's law
   of minimization in 2D IC. However, the reliability of 3D IC, which is
   greatly influenced by voids and failure in interconnects during the
   fabrication processes, typically requires slow testing and relies on
   human's judgement. Thus, the growing demand for 3D IC has generated
   considerable attention on the importance of reliability analysis and
   failure prediction. This research conducts 3D X-ray tomographic images
   combining with AI deep learning based on a convolutional neural network
   (CNN) for non-destructive analysis of solder interconnects. By training
   the AI machine using a reliable database of collected images, the AI can
   quickly detect and predict the interconnect operational faults of solder
   joints with an accuracy of up to 89.9\% based on non-destructive 3D
   X-ray tomographic images. The important features which determine the
   ``Good{''} or ``Failure{''} condition for a reflowed microbump, such as
   area loss percentage at the middle cross-section, are also revealed.},

Title = {Smart Analysis of Learners Performance Using Learning Analytics for
   Improving Academic Progression: A Case Study Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In the current COVID-19 pandemic era, Learning Management Systems (LMS)
   are commonly used in e-learning for various learning activities in
   Higher Education. Learning Analytics (LA) is an emerging area of LMS,
   which plays a vital role in tracking and storing learners' activities in
   the online environment in Higher Education. LA treats the collections of
   students' digital footprints and evaluates this data to improve teaching
   and learning quality. LA measures the analysis and reports learners'
   data and their activities to predict decisions on every tier of the
   education system. This promising area, which both teachers and students
   can use during this pandemic outbreak, converges LA, Artificial
   Intelligence, and Human-Centered Design in data visualization
   techniques, semantic and educational data mining techniques, feature
   data extraction, etc. Different learning activities of learners for each
   course are analyzed with the help of LA plug-ins. The progression of
   learners can be monitored and predicted with the help of this
   intelligent analysis, which aids in improving the academic progress of
   each learner in a secured manner. The Object-Oriented Programming course
   and Data Communication Network are used to implement our case studies
   and to collect the analysis reports. Two plug-ins, local and log store
   plug-ins, are added to the sample course, and reports are observed. This
   research collected and monitored the data of the activities each
   students are involved in. This analysis provides the distribution of
   access to contents from which the number of active students and
   students' activities can be inferred. This analysis provides insight
   into how many assignment submissions and quiz submissions were on time.
   The hits distribution is also provided in the analytical chart. Our
   findings show that teaching methods can be improved based on these
   inferences as it reflects the students' learning preferences, especially
   during this COVID-19 era. Furthermore, each student's academic
   progression can be marked and planned in the department.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence Evaluation for Mathematics Teaching in Colleges
   under the Guidance of Wireless Network},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Comprehensively improving the quality of teaching is the highlight of
   current higher education. Also, it meets the basic needs of China's
   current transformation into a country for strong education. Mathematics
   is one of the most important subjects in education these days, which is
   widely applied in research, social life, and understanding various
   science theories and laws. Hence, improving the quality of teaching
   mathematics in colleges becomes an important task in modern college
   teaching. In particular, the wireless integration of information has
   enriched and diversified the teaching methods of higher education.
   Vigorously promoting the application of wireless network technology in
   mathematics teaching is not only an effective way to solve the
   insufficient supply of educational resources but also a bold attempt to
   innovate the mathematics teaching mode in colleges and universities.
   Firstly, this work proposes an IACO-BP (improved ant colony
   optimization-based backpropagation) network to evaluate teaching quality
   for higher level mathematics in a wireless network environment. It
   improves the traditional ant colony optimization algorithm from three
   aspects, namely ant colony pheromone adaptive volatility coefficient,
   pheromone iterative elite selection strategy, and population iteration,
   adding a variation factor to construct IACO. Then, we use IACO to
   optimize initial weight and threshold to solve the issue of BP network's
   falling into local optimum and improve network performance. Secondly,
   this work puts forward a series of countermeasures for the construction
   of mathematics teaching system in colleges. The correctness and
   superiority of the proposed strategy are verified by comparing the
   mathematics teaching quality in colleges before and after using the
   proposed strategies. Various aspects of mathematics teaching, such as
   teaching objectives, teaching content, and teaching process, are
   evaluated before and after using these strategies. These features are
   improved by a significant margin, up to 2.6\%, after applying the
   proposed strategies.},

Title = {Enhancing Trust in Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Explainable
   Artificial Intelligence: Incorporating Local Post Hoc Explanations for a
   Glass-box Model},

Abstract = {Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cognitive dysfunction
   among older people worldwide, making it nearly impossible for them to
   carry out their daily lives. Due to the inherent characteristics of
   Alzheimer's disease and its impact on the brain, timely intervention is
   crucial to delay its onset and mitigate its progression. Currently, the
   diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease often occurs at a stage where it is too
   late for effective prevention measures, allowing the disease to cause
   significant damage to the brain. The use of machine learning and deep
   learning models is critical for the classification of demented and
   non-demented cases, but most highly accurate models are non-linear and
   less transparent, not revealing the logic behind the predictions.
   Therefore, incorporating interpretability components into the models
   will make them more transparent and trustworthy. This study is aimed to
   develop appropriate diagnostic methods capable of assessing Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the early stage of Alzheimer's disease that
   occurs before the irreversible loss of neurons. Methods: Explainable
   artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to AI systems that can provide
   explanations for their decisions or predictions. In the context of AD
   classification, explainable AI systems aim to provide insights into the
   features or characteristics of the model used to make a prediction. This
   XAI provides a mechanism to understand and interpret the basis of a
   model's predictions which is more important for improving the trust in
   the system and its results. As such, a non-linear neural network is
   employed in this work to distinguish between demented and non-demented
   cases while local post hoc explanations are incorporated to make it a
   glass-box model using the XAI techniques such as SHapley Additive
   exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations
   (LIME). Results: The application of LIME provided valuable insights into
   the impact of various factors on predictions. Notably, factors such as
   CDR, Age, and ASF aligned with clinical knowledge and proved
   instrumental in predicting dementia cases. Conversely, features like
   nWBV, MMSE, and eTIV adversely affected the predictions, highlighting
   their significance in identifying non-demented cases. Similarly,
   exploring SHAP values yielded a comprehensive understanding of the
   decision-making process employed by the model in detecting Alzheimer's
   disease. Conclusion: Through the utilization of explainable artificial
   intelligence (XAI) methods, this study endeavors to develop a dependable
   and transparent technique for early detection, monitoring, and
   personalized interventions in the realm of Alzheimer's disease.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 FEB 2},
Abstract = {The modern intelligent transportation system opts for accident
   prediction modules as a critical aspect for road safety. Where, an
   accident is predicted before it actually happens and precautionary
   measures be taken for its avoidance. Accident prediction methods'
   analysis is also popular for critical infrastructure protection.
   Recently, Deep Learning (DL) techniques coupled with the classical
   Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have produced promising results in
   various domains. This work presents a DL and AI-based system of
   identifying driving risks for the Light Transport Vehicles (LTVs) that
   generate early warnings before an anticipated accident. These warnings
   enable to avoid critical traffic accidents. The proposed system collects
   and learns various driver's LTV driving style patterns and afterward
   applies DL to classify the driver in one of the predefined classes. The
   proposed system consists of a custom-built driving simulator integrated
   with a computer that provides real-life driving experience for data
   recording. The miniature hardware simulator mimics an LTV consisting of
   a steering wheel, clutch, brake accelerator, gear assembly, and
   indicators. The collected data is first evaluated using unsupervised
   learning methods. Afterwards, it is used to train the DL classifier. The
   obtained results show that the proposed system attains an average
   classification accuracy of 85\%, where the maximum accuracy of 97\% is
   observed for the gradient boosting classifier.},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   In this work, a comprehensive review on how data-driven modelling and
   machine learning for error compensation in additive manufacturing is
   conferred.
   Additive Manufacturing (AM) of three-dimensional objects is now being
   progressively realised with its ad-hoc approach with minimal material
   wastage (lean manufacturing) being one of its benefit by default. It
   could also be considered as an evolutional paradigm in the manufacturing
   industry with its long list of application as of late. Artificial
   Intelligence is currently finding its usefulness in predictive modelling
   to provide intelligent, efficient, customisable, high-quality and
   sustainable-oriented production process. This paper presents a
   comprehensive survey on commonly used predictive models based on
   heuristic algorithms and discusses their applications toward making AM
   ``smart{''}. This paper summarises AM's current trend, future
   opportunity, gaps, and requirements together with recommendations for
   technology and research for inter-industry collaboration, educational
   training and technology transfer in the AI perspective in-line with the
   Industry 4.0 developmental process. Moreover, machine learning
   algorithms are presented for detecting product defects in the
   cyber-physical system of additive manufacturing. Based on reviews on
   various applications, printability with multi-indicators, reduction of
   design complexity threshold, acceleration of prefabrication, real-time
   control, enhancement of security and defect detection for customised
   designs are seen of as prospective opportunities for further research.},

Abstract = {Institutions of higher learning are currently facing the challenging
   task of attracting new students who can effectively meet their diverse
   academic demands. With these demands come the need for those
   institutions to develop strategies that can enhance students' learning
   experiences at various educational levels. Predicting the academic
   success at an early stage would allow academic institutions to develop
   specific enrolment guidelines while avoiding poor performance. The main
   purpose of this study was to predict the academic performance of
   students, their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in particular, at
   postgraduate levels (e.g., master's degree), using and comparing
   different machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work uses a real
   dataset of 635 master's students collected from the college of graduate
   studies of a reputable private university in Malaysia. The predictive
   model's goodness-of-fitness is determined using the coefficient of
   determination R-2, which indicates the percentage of the variance in the
   dependent variables. The mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error
   (MAE) are used to evaluate the model's performance, by identifying
   discrepancies between the predicted CGPA and the actual CGPA. Of the six
   different ML models applied, our results showed that the artificial
   neural network (ANN) model has the best performance, achieving 89\% of
   the variation in the CGPA of the students, with a training error of only
   0.06 CGPA points and a prediction error of 0.08 CGPA points. The
   Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with squared exponential kernel
   algorithm achieved 71\% of the CGPA variation. The model achieved 0.095
   CGPA points for both training and evaluation errors. Exploring other
   variables such as research activities, marital status, and living
   conditions would have improved the overall accuracy of the proposed ML
   models. Therefore, future investigations should focus on predicting the
   academic performance of larger numbers of postgraduates (i.e., PhD and
   Masters) using different predictive variables and AI models. (C) 2022

Abstract = {Today's students, known as digital natives, are living a paradox.
   Although they grew up with technology, there are many studies which
   underline that students' digital skills are not what they might seem.
   Thus, even if they are more familiar than professors or parents with
   functions and options available on the most used social networks and
   applications like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube etc., they
   still need ``support with some areas of digital practice, particularly
   in an academic context{''} (JISC, 2015).
   But are these perceptions / expectations of students' digital skills
   based on reality? Moreover, what should we do as their professors?
   Firstly, we should not forget that not all students have equal access to
   digital resources. Some of them need to be trained more
   concretely/effectively and most of them need to refine and update their
   digital skills and competencies in order to become more employable,
   ready to cope with the digital jobs of the future.
   Secondly, they need to benefit from staff well equipped with digital
   skills, who can design and deliver courses with technology integrated,
   able to pass on the relevant digital skills to their students and
   colleagues.
   Thirdly, they need a proper and adequate digital environment.
   Given this approach, we formulated our research questions as follows:
   What are the challenges in creating the right environments for digital
   learning?
   What are institutions doing in order to equip professors with digital
   skills?
   The aim of the present paper is to review existing evidence on what a
   digital university means. What is it? What actions should we take
   towards becoming a digital university? Thus, we conducted a small-scale
   study within the Romanian higher education space in order to investigate
   the aforesaid research questions and to emphasize what concrete steps,
   actions, responsibilities and measures should be taken to drive forward
   a digital university vision.},

Abstract = {Prediction and early detection of kidney damage induced by nonsteroidal
   anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) would provide the best chances of
   maximizing the anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing the risk of
   kidney damage. Unfortunately, biomarkers for detecting NSAID-induced
   kidney damage in cats remain to be discovered. To identify potential
   urinary biomarkers for monitoring NSAID-based treatments, we applied an
   untargeted metabolomics approach to urine collected from cats treated
   repeatedly with meloxicam or saline for up to 17 days. Applying
   multivariate analysis, this study identified a panel of seven
   metabolites that discriminate meloxicam treated from saline treated
   cats. Combining artificial intelligence machine learning algorithms and
   an independent testing urinary metabolome data set from cats with
   meloxicam-induced kidney damage, a panel of metabolites was identified
   and validated. The panel of metabolites including tryptophan, tyrosine,
   taurine, threonic acid, pseudouridine, xylitol and lyxitol, successfully
   distinguish meloxicam-treated and saline-treated cats with up to
   75-100\% sensitivity and specificity. This panel of urinary metabolites
   may prove a useful and non-invasive diagnostic tool for monitoring
   potential NSAID induced kidney injury in feline patients and may act as
   the framework for identifying urine biomarkers of NSAID induced injury
   in other species.},

Title = {Analysis of portable solar concrete ponds by using coal cinder to trap
   thermal energy of sustainable building using artificial intelligence},
Journal = {FUEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {348},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Cinder is a waste product made from the coal residue left over from
   power plant blast furnaces. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy
   source, but because of its erratic availability, energy storage
   technologies must be used. Our research suggests employing coal cinder
   (CC) to boost the thermal energy stored in transportable solar concrete
   ponds, combining rock mechanics with renewable energy. The concepts of
   renewable energy and rock mechanics are combined in this invention.
   Additionally, because it doesn't release any pollutants into the sky, it
   is great for low heat applications like building cooling and heating.
   However, due to its sporadic nature, solar energy requires effective
   energy storage to be used at night and in cloudy weather. By adding coal
   cinders to the bottom layer of a solar concrete pond in order to
   increase its heat energy, this work integrates rock mechanics with
   sustainable energy. A variety of small-scale research use the standard
   micro solar concrete ponds. Also offered is a numerical calculation for
   predicting energy development over a sizable area of a solar pond with a
   salt gradient. The coal cinders may significantly raise the temperature
   at the pond's bottom. With a constant temperature differential of 30
   degrees C and 20 degrees C throughout the gradient layer for two
   different pond sizes with depths of 1.5 m and 1.0 m, this study provides
   thermal analysis of a salt gradient solar pond using machine learning as
   Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and extracting heat from the Lower
   Convective Zone (LCZ). Going through the regression indices (RMSE, R2,
   r), the energy efficiency (heat) of the first 1.5-meter-deep concrete
   pond varies between 22.1 and 11.3\% throughout the winter. The energy
   performance of a solar pond decreases dramatically when the
   non-convective zone thickness and its size are decreased. For the two
   concrete ponds with depths of 1.5 m and 1.0 m, respectively, the annual
   average efficiencies are 23\% and 16\%. Hence, the solar pond
   demonstrates that it is an effective method for utilizing solar energy
   and may be a useful option for low-temperature energy needs, such as
   room heating.},

Title = {Influencing factors, prediction and prevention of depression in college
   students: A literature review},

Abstract = {The high prevalence of depression among college students has a strong
   negative impact on individual physical and mental health, academic
   development, and interpersonal communication. This paper reviewed the
   extant literature by identifying nonpathological factors related to
   college students' depression, investigating the methods of predicting
   depression, and exploring nonpharmaceutical interventions for college
   students' depression. The influencing factors of college students'
   depression mainly fell into four categories: biological factors,
   personality and psychological state, college experience, and lifestyle.
   The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the severity of
   depression among college students worldwide and poses grave challenges
   to the prevention and treatment of depression, given that the
   coronavirus has spread quickly with high infection rates, and the
   pandemic has changed the daily routines of college life. To predict and
   measure mental health, more advanced methods, such as machine algorithms
   and artificial intelligence, have emerged in recent years apart from the
   traditional commonly used psychological scales. Regarding
   nonpharmaceutical prevention measures, both general measures and
   professional measures for the prevention and treatment of college
   students' depression were examined in this study. Students who
   experience depressive disorders need family support and personalized
   interventions at college, which should also be supplemented by
   professional interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and
   online therapy. Through this literature review, we insist that the
   technology of identification, prediction, and prevention of depression
   among college students based on big data platforms will be extensively
   used in the future. Higher education institutions should understand the
   potential risk factors related to college students' depression and make
   more accurate screening and prevention available with the help of
   advanced technologies.},

Title = {Use of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Predicting the Strength of
   Recycled Aggregate Concrete and the Influence of Raw Ingredients},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Cracking is one of the main problems in concrete structures and is
   affected by various parameters. The step-by-step laboratory method,
   which includes casting specimens, curing for a certain period, and
   testing, remains a source of worry in terms of cost and time. Novel
   machine learning methods for anticipating the behavior of raw materials
   on the ultimate output of concrete are being introduced to address the
   difficulties outlined above such as the excessive consumption of time
   and money. This work estimates the splitting-tensile strength of
   concrete containing recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) using artificial
   intelligence methods considering nine input parameters and 154 mixes.
   One individual machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) and
   three ensembled machine learning algorithms (AdaBoost, Bagging, and
   random forest) are considered. Additionally, a post hoc model-agnostic
   method named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was performed to study
   the influence of raw ingredients on the splitting-tensile strength. The
   model's performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination
   (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
   Then, the model's performance was validated using k-fold
   cross-validation. The random forest model, with an R-2 of 0.96,
   outperformed the AdaBoost models. The random forest models with greater
   R-2 and lower error (RMSE = 0.49) had superior performance. It was
   revealed from the SHAP analysis that the cement content had the highest
   positive influence on the splitting-tensile strength of the recycled
   aggregate concrete and the primary contact of cement is with water. The
   feature interaction plot shows that high water content has a negative
   impact on the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) splitting-tensile
   strength, but the increased cement content had a beneficial effect.},

Abstract = {It is well-documented how artificial intelligence can have (and already
   is having) a big impact on chemical engineering. But classical machine
   learning approaches may be weak for many chemical engineering
   applications. This review discusses how challenging data characteristics
   arise in chemical engineering applications. We identify four
   characteristics of data arising in chemical engineering applications
   that make applying classical artificial intelligence approaches
   difficult: (1) high variance, low volume data, (2) low variance, high
   volume data, (3) noisy/ corrupt/ missing data, and (4) restricted data
   with physics-based limitations. For each of these four data
   characteristics, we discuss applications where these data
   characteristics arise and show how current chemical engineering research
   is extending the fields of data science and machine learning to
   incorporate these challenges. Finally, we identify several challenges
   for future research. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {With the increase of teaching resources in universities, allocation for
   teaching resources has gradually attracted people's attention. How to
   optimize and reorganize the numerous teaching resources so as to
   maximize the teaching efficiency and achieve the best teaching effect is
   a question that the majority of college management workers must think
   deeply. Due to the development of computer science, artificial neural
   networks and wireless networks have made considerable progress. This
   article optimizes the resources of colleges and universities from these
   two aspects. First, this work proposes an improved artificial neural
   network to optimize school resources. The algorithm pointed out that the
   adaptive genetic algorithm itself has problems such as slow evolution
   speed and poor individual diversity of the population. After that an
   improved adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize BP network
   training process. By introducing individual evolutionary trend
   adjustment parameters, a new calculation formula for crossover
   probability as well as mutation probability is constructed. Improved BP
   algorithm can effectively avoid the shortcomings of local minima.
   Second, additional momentum and adaptive learning rate strategies are
   used to optimize BP network to promote the efficiency for network
   training. Third, the artificial intelligence network is deployed in the
   wireless network, and the wireless network will complete the work of
   data collection, processing, and transmission, so as to optimize the
   resources of colleges and universities.},

   Techniques},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {It is very important to keep structures and constructional elements in
   service during and after exposure to elevated temperatures.
   Investigation of the structural behaviour of different components and
   structures at elevated temperatures is an approach to manipulate the
   serviceability of the structures during heat exposure. Channel
   connectors are widely used shear connectors not only for their appealing
   mechanical properties but also for their workability and cost-effective
   nature. In this study, a finite element (FE) evaluation was performed on
   an authentic composite model, and the behaviour of the channel shear
   connector at elevated temperature was examined. Furthermore, a novel
   hybrid intelligence algorithm based on a feature-selection trait with
   the incorporation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) algorithms has been developed to predict the slip
   response of the channel. The hybrid intelligence algorithm that uses
   artificial neural networks is performed on derived data from the FE
   study. Finally, the obtained numerical results are compared with extreme
   learning machine (ELM) and radial basis function (RBF) results. The
   MLP-PSO represented dramatically accurate results for slip value
   prediction at elevated temperatures. The results proved the active
   presence of the channels, especially to improve the stiffness and
   loading capacity of the composite beam. Although the height enhances the
   ductility, stiffness is significantly reduced at elevated temperatures.
   According to the results, temperature, failure load, the height of
   connector and concrete block strength are the key governing parameters
   for composite floor design against high temperatures.},

Title = {Seven principles to ensure future-ready accounting graduates - a model
   for future research and practice},
Journal = {MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1354-1380},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The business environment is changing and education at university
   business schools does not appear to keep pace. This paper aims to
   identify principles to guide educators in preparing accounting students
   for automation and artificial intelligence and sets an agenda for future
   research.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The seven principles are derived from an extensive literature review and
   the analysis of qualitative data from focus groups, thought leader
   discussions, interviews and workshops.
   Findings
   The derived seven Cs model includes: critical, conceptual thinking and
   the spirit of enquiry; complicate, grapple and fail; create, innovate
   and experience; concise communication; collaboration; consciousness,
   respectfulness and ethical fibre; and curiosity, lifelong learning and
   specialized generalists. An inclusive list of future research topics
   related to the seven Cs model is provided to aid researchers' agendas.
   Research limitations/implications
   Although every attempt was made to base this study purely on expert
   opinions, as reflected in journal articles, conference papers,
   interviews and focus groups, it is impossible to prevent author biases
   from slipping into the interpretation and reflection involved in
   creating the model. Readers will also find some overlap in terms of the
   accounting business competencies development model's seven Cs, due to
   the inter-related nature of the concepts and because the various
   definitions of concepts have some habits of the mind and social
   competencies in common.
   Practical implications
   The seven principles will help business schools and higher education
   policymakers guide future education developments with a focus on new
   competencies and reframed skills, as opposed to new knowledge. The model
   ensures that scholars and graduates have insight into the essential
   knowledge, attributes and skills that apply to the diverse nature of
   accounting vocations and can adapt to unanticipated changes.
   Social implications
   This new model can be used by business schools to ensure that graduates
   can fully contribute to a society impacted by automation and artificial
   intelligence by entering the workplace with the requisite skills. It
   also responds to critics' fears about the role of business schools in
   preparing graduates for the future of work.
   Originality/value
   The paper contributes in two ways. First, rather than focussing on
   particular issues or the shortcomings of current education, it
   identifies broad-based principles from a literature review, interviews,
   focus groups and workshops. Second, it sets an agenda for future
   research.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to introduce a new approach to enhance college English
   learning through an intelligent method that constructs a learning
   environment from a demand analysis perspective. The proposed model
   utilizes a bionic algorithm to structure the algorithm and adopts a
   highly efficient energy generation method to calculate the interaction
   energy. This study aims to find the optimal solution to the constraint
   problem by using a process of continuous generation, expansion, and
   replacement of magnetosomes. The methodology employed in this research
   involved constructing the college English learning environment in
   colleges and universities from a demand analysis perspective. This was
   achieved by analyzing the needs and requirements of college students and
   designing an ecological virtual learning environment (EVLE) that meets
   their demands. The findings of this study indicate that the proposed
   EVLE for college English is effective in improving the effectiveness of
   college English learning. The experimental verification results support
   the effectiveness of the proposed model in creating an interactive and
   engaging learning environment that facilitates the acquisition of
   English language skills. It is an innovative approach to college English
   learning that utilizes intelligent methods to construct a demand-driven
   learning environment that enhances students' learning outcomes.},

Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},

Abstract = {In higher education teaching work, college students not only need to
   master the professional knowledge and professional skills they learn
   during their school study but also need to improve their self-education
   and self-cultivation and constantly improve their comprehensive ability
   of learning. At present, there are differences and relationships between
   the education of college students in civic and mental normal education,
   and how to play the role of the integration of the two educations has
   become a problem that needs to be considered in the current work of
   college students' training. The integration between civic education and
   mental normal education can make up for the shortcomings of monolithic
   civic education and mental normal education work and also optimize the
   teaching methods between them from a certain perspective to achieve the
   development goals of complementing each other and not being independent
   of each other, so that students can understand more learning methods and
   contents that promote the normal development of their own minds and
   minds. In response to the problem that mind-normal education cannot be
   automatically integrated into the teaching of university thought and
   political science courses, in the context of artificial intelligence,
   this paper proposes a multi-channel-based mind-normal and ideological
   and political information fusion model. The model has two channels,
   BERT+CNN and BERT and BiLSTM-Attention; firstly, the pretraining model
   BERT is used to obtain the word vector representation of the fused text
   context; then, the CNN network of channel one is used to enhance the
   ability of local feature extraction of the text, and the
   BiLSTM-Attention model of channel two enhances the ability of long
   sequence text processing and is key. Finally, the fused features of
   channel 1 and channel 2 are classified using a softmax excitation
   function. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments
   are conducted on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence performance in detecting tumor metastasis from
   medical radiology imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECLINICALMEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Early diagnosis of tumor metastasis is crucial for clinical
   treatment. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in the
   field of medicine. We therefore aimed to evaluate the diagnostic
   accuracy of AI algorithms in detecting tumor metastasis using medical
   radiology imaging.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published
   from January 1, 1997, to January 30, 2020. Studies evaluating an AI
   model for the diagnosis of tumor metastasis from medical images were
   included. We excluded studies that used histopathology images or medical
   wave-form data and those focused on the region segmentation of interest.
   Studies providing enough information to construct contingency tables
   were included in a meta-analysis.
   Findings: We identified 2620 studies, of which 69 were included. Among
   them, 34 studies were included in a meta-analysis with a pooled
   sensitivity of 82\% (95\% CI 79-84\%), specificity of 84\% (82-87\%) and
   AUC of 0.90 (0.87-0.92). Analysis for different AI algorithms showed a
   pooled sensitivity of 87\% (83-90\%) for machine learning and 86\%
   (82-89\%) for deep learning, and a pooled specificity of 89\% (82-93\%)
   for machine learning, and 87\% (82-91\%) for deep learning.
   Interpretation: AI algorithms may be used for the diagnosis of tumor
   metastasis using medical radiology imaging with equivalent or even
   better performance to health-care professionals, in terms of sensitivity
   and specificity. At the same time, rigorous reporting standards with
   external validation and comparison to health-care professionals are
   urgently needed for AI application in the medical field. (c) 2020

Abstract = {In the present research, the authors propose the planning, assignment
   and use of digital learning objects with augmented reality according to
   the learning style of students in higher education, according to the
   VARK Model. It is found that students with treatment have had better
   results in their final grades than students who have not undergone the
   treatment of having used digital learning objects with augmented
   reality. The digital objects of learning (DLO's) with augmented reality
   designed according to the learning style of the students are an
   attractive and adequate option so that the teachers who are the main
   responsible for the didactic planning can spread the knowledge in the
   students. So that traditional forms of education are put aside and as a
   result of taking advantage of Information and Communication Technologies
   that have come to break with the paradigms that have prevailed for years
   in the teaching - learning process. On the other hand, education based
   on e-learning platforms facilitates the training of students at a
   distance allowing them to build and self-manage learning, as well as
   facilitate the dissemination of digital learning objects with augmented
   reality according to the learning style according to the VARK Model.},

Title = {Rapid detection of nicotine and benzoic acid in e-liquids with
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering and artificial intelligence-assisted

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOMEDICAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Electronic cigarettes have rapidly gained acceptance recently.
   Nicotine-containing electronic cigarette liquids (eliquids) are
   prohibited in some countries, but are permitted and simply available
   online in others. A rapid detection method is therefore required for
   on-site inspection or screening of a large amount of samples. Our
   previous study demonstrated a surface-enhanced Raman scattering
   (SERS)-based approach to identify nicotinecontaining e-liquids; without
   any pre-treatment, e-liquid can be directly tested on our solid-phase
   SERS substrates, made of silver nanoparticle arrays embedded in anodic
   aluminium oxide nanochannels (Ag/AAO). However, this approach required
   manual determination of spectral signatures and negative samples should
   be validated in the second round detection. Here, after examining 406
   commercial e-liquids, we refined this approach by developing artificial
   intelligence (AI)-assisted spectrum interpretations. We also found that
   nicotine and benzoic acid can be simultaneously detected in our
   platform. This increased test sensitivity because benzoic acid is
   usually used in nicotine salts. Around 64\% of nicotine-positive samples
   in this study showed both signatures. Using either cutoffs of nicotine
   and benzoic acid peak intensities or a machine learning model based on
   the CatBoost algorithm, over 90\% of tested samples can be correctly
   discriminated with only one round of SERS measurement. False negative
   and false positive rates were 2.5-4.4\% and 4.4-8.9\%, respectively,
   depending on the interpretation method and thresholds applied. The new
   approach takes only 1 microliter of sample and can be performed in 1-2
   min, suitable for on-site inspection with portable Raman detectors. It
   could also be a complementary platform to reduce samples that need to be
   analyzed in the central labs and has the potential to identify other
   prohibited additives.},

Abstract = {Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare, malignant cutaneous
   adenocarcinoma with a high recurrence rate after surgical resection.
   Early diagnosis of EMPD is critical as 15\%-40\% of cases progress into
   an invasive form and resulting in a dismal prognosis. However, EMPD can
   be a diagnostic challenge to pathologists, especially in the grassroots
   hospital, because of its low incidence and nonspecific clinical
   presentation. Although AI-enabled computer-aided diagnosis solutions
   have been extensively used in dermatological pathological image analysis
   to diagnose common skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell
   carcinoma, these techniques have yet been applied to diagnose EMPD.
   Here, we developed and verified a deep learning method with five
   different deep convolutional neural networks, named ResNet34, ResNet50,
   MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, and VGG16, in Asian EMPD pathological image
   screening to distinguish between Paget's and normal cells. We further
   demonstrated that the results of the proposed method are quantitative,
   fast, and repeatable by a retrospective single-center study. The
   ResNet34 model achieved the best performance with an accuracy of
   95.522\% in pathological images collected at a magnification of x40. We
   envision this method can potentially empower grassroots pathologists'
   efficiency and accuracy as well as to ultimately provide better patient
   care.},

   Methods: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited
   from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants
   completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of
   the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49\%) were
   given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group
   members (50/99, 51\%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in
   addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester,
   which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also
   completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the
   9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
   Results: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years;
   27\% (27/99) of the group were male and 60\% (59/99) identified as
   Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the
   comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group
   interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There
   was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the
   mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to
   6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P<.001). There was a significant reduction in
   the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was
   10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at
   the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups
   independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness
   Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social
   awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in
   the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22\%)
   where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score
   11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score
   13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of
   the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001).
   Conclusions: It is possible to deliver EI and mindfulness training in a
   scalable way using the Ajivar app during the COVID-19 pandemic,
   resulting in improvements in anxiety, depression, and EI in the college
   student population.},

Abstract = {White light endoscopy is the most pivotal tool for detecting early
   gastric neoplasms. Previous artificial intelligence (AI) systems were
   primarily unexplainable, affecting their clinical credibility and
   acceptability. We aimed to develop an explainable AI named ENDOANGEL-ED
   (explainable diagnosis) to solve this problem. A total of 4482 images
   and 296 videos with focal lesions from 3279 patients from eight
   hospitals were used for training, validating, and testing ENDOANGEL-ED.
   A traditional sole deep learning (DL) model was trained using the same
   dataset. The performance of ENDOANGEL-ED and sole DL was evaluated on
   six levels: internal and external images, internal and external videos,
   consecutive videos, and man-machine comparison with 77 endoscopists in
   videos. Furthermore, a multi-reader, multi-case study was conducted to
   evaluate the ENDOANGEL-ED's effectiveness. A scale was used to compare
   the overall acceptance of endoscopists to traditional and explainable AI
   systems. The ENDOANGEL-ED showed high performance in the image and video
   tests. In man-machine comparison, the accuracy of ENDOANGEL-ED was
   significantly higher than that of all endoscopists in internal (81.10\%
   vs. 70.61\%, p < 0.001) and external videos (88.24\% vs. 78.49\%, p <
   0.001). With ENDOANGEL-ED's assistance, the accuracy of endoscopists
   significantly improved (70.61\% vs. 79.63\%, p < 0.001). Compared with
   the traditional AI, the explainable AI increased the endoscopists' trust
   and acceptance (4.42 vs. 3.74, p < 0.001; 4.52 vs. 4.00, p < 0.001). In
   conclusion, we developed a real-time explainable AI that showed high
   performance, higher clinical credibility, and acceptance than
   traditional DL models and greatly improved the diagnostic ability of
   endoscopists.},

Title = {Perceived Achievement of Social Entrepreneurship Competency: The
   Influence of Age, Discipline, and Gender among Women in Higher Education},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {The complexity of today's world demands a shift in education from
   knowledge acquisition to competency development for students to
   effectively address profession-related challenges. In particular, there
   is a need for social entrepreneurs who can act as catalysts for change
   in complex environments. Understanding the elements that shape students'
   perception of themselves as social entrepreneurs allows us to grasp
   their capacity as catalysts for transformative action. The main purpose
   of this research is to showcase the findings of a diagnostic
   investigation carried out on a group of Mexican university students,
   assessing their perceived proficiency in social entrepreneurship and its
   sub-competencies. The study examined whether age or discipline
   influenced the perception of entrepreneurship in 328 students. The
   results revealed that age and study discipline played a crucial role in
   shaping students' perception of their competency achievement. Younger
   students tended to perceive their abilities better, while advanced
   semester students were more cautious in assessing their entrepreneurial
   competencies. The trend also extended to sub-competencies, with younger
   students tending to perceive their social skills positively, while older
   students focused more on practical knowledge such as the economic and
   administrative aspects of entrepreneurship. Students in business also
   tended to view their skills more positively compared to students in
   other disciplines. The findings highlight the need to promote women's
   social entrepreneurship and emphasize the importance of considering
   these relevant elements that are crucial to the concrete reality of
   potential female entrepreneurs. The study has significant implications
   for policymakers, educators, and researchers interested in promoting
   social entrepreneurship among women, particularly in the Latin American
   context.},

Abstract = {Computer simulations have been used by us since the early 1970s to gain
   an understanding of the spacing and movement patterns of confined
   animals. The work has progressed from the early stages, in which we used
   randomly positioned points, to current investigations of animats
   (computer-simulated animals), which show low levels of learning via
   artificial neural networks. We have determined that 1) pens of equal
   floor area but of different shape result in different spatial and
   movement patterns for randomly positioned and moving animats; 2) when
   group size increases under constant density, freedom of movement
   approaches an asymptote at approximately six animats; 3) matching the
   number of animats with the number of corners results in optimal freedom
   of movement for small groups of animats; and 4) perimeter positioning
   occurs in groups of animats that maximize their distance to first- and
   second-nearest neighbors. Recently, we developed animats that move,
   compete for social dominance, and are motivated to obtain resources
   (food, resting sites, etc.). We are currently developing an animat that
   learns its behavior fi om the spatial and movement data collected on
   live pigs. The animat model is then used to pretest pen designs,
   followed by new pig spatial data fed into the animat model, resulting in
   a new pen design to be tested, and the steps are repeated. We believe
   that methodologies from artificial-life and artificial intelligence can
   contribute to the understanding of basic animal behavior principles, as
   well as to the solving of problems in production agriculture in areas
   such as animal housing design.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of the Internet and communications has resulted in a
   huge increase in transmitted data. These data are coveted by attackers
   and they continuously create novel attacks to steal or corrupt these
   data. The growth of these attacks is an issue for the security of our
   systems and represents one of the biggest challenges for intrusion
   detection. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a tool that helps to
   detect intrusions by inspecting the network traffic. Although many
   researchers have studied and created new IDS solutions, IDS still needs
   improving in order to have good detection accuracy while reducing false
   alarm rates. In addition, many IDS struggle to detect zero-day attacks.
   Recently, machine learning algorithms have become popular with
   researchers to detect network intrusion in an efficient manner and with
   high accuracy. This paper presents the concept of IDS and provides a
   taxonomy of machine learning methods. The main metrics used to assess an
   IDS are presented and a review of recent IDS using machine learning is
   provided where the strengths and weaknesses of each solution is
   outlined. Then, details of the different datasets used in the studies
   are provided and the accuracy of the results from the reviewed work is
   discussed. Finally, observations, research challenges and future trends

   the study proposes an AI Ecological Education Policy Framework to
   address the multifaceted implications of AI integration in university
   teaching and learning. This framework is organized into three
   dimensions: Pedagogical, Governance, and Operational. The Pedagogical
   dimension concentrates on using AI to improve teaching and learning
   outcomes, while the Governance dimension tackles issues related to
   privacy, security, and accountability. The Operational dimension
   addresses matters concerning infrastructure and training. The framework
   fosters a nuanced understanding of the implications of AI integration in
   academic settings, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of their
   responsibilities and can take appropriate actions accordingly.},

Abstract = {New technologies and the knowledge economy are destabilising graduate
   professions, with artificial intelligence and the analysis of `big data'
   making significant impacts on formerly secure jobs. Blockchain
   technology, offering automated secure credentialling of undergraduate
   students' activities and achievements, may significantly erode existing
   systems of assessment. The challenge for universities will be not only
   to maintain the relevance of their curricula but also to manage erosion
   of their current near-monopoly in awarding degrees. This paper envisions
   a landscape in which universities must outsource parts of their course
   delivery and assessment in order to remain competitive. It examines a
   potentially sustainable mission strategy: to move away from narrow
   academic disciplines towards an authentic learning curriculum focusing
   on the development of students as whole persons with rounded educations.
   This paper examines implications for the academy of the convergence of
   artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain technology.},

Title = {The Influence of Data Length on the Performance of Artificial

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Air pollution is one of humanity's most critical environmental issues
   and is considered contentious in several countries worldwide. As a
   result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and
   government decision-making for environmental management. In this study,
   three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of
   data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM),
   and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the
   hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada.
   The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data
   length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different
   ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and
   90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets
   for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that
   the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the
   60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models.
   Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise
   predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital
   feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential
   changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results
   reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting
   the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly
   which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving
   different environmental issues.},

Title = {A muggles guide to deep learning wizardry},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {E240-E248},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: Growing interest in the applications of artificial
   intelligence (AI) and, in particular, deep learning (DL) in nuclear
   medicine and radiology partitions the professional community. At one end
   of the spectrum are our expert DL wizards developing potion-like code
   and waving the DL capabilities like a wand across our professions. On
   the opposite side of the spectrum are our muggle colleagues who lack the
   wizardry of DL and may be largely oblivious to the entire magical realm.
   Key findings: As crafted by Arthur C Clark, any sufficiently advanced
   technology is indistinguishable from magic. DL is not only an important
   technology in the future of medical imaging, but its application lives
   in the capabilities of medical imaging technologists. This may be
   incidental through application of techniques at the patient interface,
   through role expansion in data curation and management, or as active
   members of DL projects and development. Understanding the rudimentary
   principles of DL is emerging as requisite in medical imaging.
   Conclusion: AI and DL are valuable tools in advancing capabilities and
   outcomes in medical imaging. A working knowledge of the technology and
   techniques is important and achievable for the medical imaging
   technologist even when capability in application of DL to research and
   clinical practice is not within one's interests or scope of practice.
   Implications for practice: While there is no requisite for all of the
   professional community to be tutored in the wizardry of DL, there are
   benefits for the profession and our patients for all to have a
   rudimentary understanding of the language and landscape. The breadth of
   DL literature assumes a level of understanding not evident for the bulk
   of our professions. This manuscript provides a simplified primer on DL
   with the aim of arming the muggles among us with sufficient insight to
   navigate the magical realm of DL without transferring any wizardry
   capability itself. (C) 2021 The College of Radiographers. Published by

Title = {Chatting and cheating: Ensuring academic integrity in the era of ChatGPT},
Journal = {INNOVATIONS IN EDUCATION AND TEACHING INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 15},
Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence in academia is a hot topic in the
   education field. ChatGPT is an AI tool that offers a range of benefits,
   including increased student engagement, collaboration, and
   accessibility. However, is also raises concerns regarding academic
   honesty and plagiarism. This paper examines the opportunities and
   challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education, and discusses the
   potential risks and rewards of these tools. The paper also considers the
   difficulties of detecting and preventing academic dishonesty, and
   suggests strategies that universities can adopt to ensure ethical and
   responsible use of these tools. These strategies include developing
   policies and procedures, providing training and support, and using
   various methods to detect and prevent cheating. The paper concludes that
   while the use of AI in higher education presents both opportunities and
   challenges, universities can effectively address these concerns by
   taking a proactive and ethical approach to the use of these tools.},

Abstract = {College students are taken as the research sample, with the purpose of
   exploring the characteristics of physical exercise and health education
   path of students under artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. First,
   related literature is studied to understand the physical education
   system of college students. Then, the current situation of physical
   exercise of college students is investigated through the interview
   survey, and the mathematical statistics method is used to analyze the
   survey results. Moreover, the necessity and paths to carry out health
   education are discussed through the analysis of the physical exercise
   behavior of college students. Finally, the college smart sports
   classroom (SSC) is constructed using AI and the big data analysis
   method. The experimental results indicate that more than 50\% of college
   students can actively participate in physical exercise. Besides, boys
   are more likely to take dangerous coping behaviors, while girls are more
   prone to choose to resist coping behaviors. In addition, there is little
   difference in age of the distribution of different coping behaviors in
   physical exercise. Freshmen are more inclined to take risky coping
   behaviors, and the quantity of students taking resistant coping
   behaviors increases with the increase of grades. Therefore, relevant
   physical health education for college students can promote the good
   habit of health exercise. This study can provide a reliable experimental
   basis for the development of sports education in the future.},

Abstract = {With the arrival of the era of artificial intelligence, based on the
   problems existing in the teaching process of marketing specialty,
   combined with the future business development trend and the core needs
   of enterprise operation, this paper analyzes the system reform of the
   practical courses of artificial intelligence and marketing specialty.
   With the rapid development of computer technology, intelligence has
   gradually become an important means to solve problems in various
   industries. In this paper, the modern media as a means, marketing
   teaching in Colleges and universities as the research background,
   through the establishment of the depth of marketing in Colleges and
   Universities Based on artificial intelligence network research learning
   platform, build a post-modern media communication perspective system.
   Based on probabilistic neural network and from the perspective of modern
   media marketing application system construction, the paper proves that
   the artificial intelligence prediction based on probabilistic neural
   network has good convergence, fault tolerance and data processing
   ability through MATLAB. Finally, this paper takes the pricing strategy
   in marketing as an example, and focuses on the application of artificial
   intelligence technology in marketing teaching from four aspects:
   preparation before class, implementation in class, consolidation after
   class and marketing teaching examination. According to the function and
   application of the theory of artificial intelligences in marketing
   teaching, we can find out that teachers must deeply understand the
   situation of each student's artificial intelligences, so as to use the
   theory of artificial intelligences to change the traditional view of
   students and talents, and teach students according to their aptitude, so
   as to achieve better teaching effect.},

   The music business is being fundamentally changed by shrewd,
   intellectual methods that rely on AI. These tools make it very easy for
   musicians to create high-caliber music. Today, sophisticated and clever
   robots are capable of creating and composing music, one of the most
   fascinating and priceless works of human ingenuity. Intelligent programs
   based on artificial intelligence have enabled robots to create beautiful
   music without the involvement of any humans. The proposed article is
   focused on the usage of AI-grounded techniques for the learning of music
   and its classification. It shows that with new technologies, highly
   interactive interfaces and classrooms can now be developed for the
   effective and efficient teaching and learning of music. Almost all of
   the students favor the implementation of such methodologies to improve
   their performance in music learning and composition. The need for time
   to employ AI for the quick improvement of the students' musical talent
   allows them to become professionals in their field. The design of
   animated courses with the integration of virtual reality and artificial
   intelligence can enhance the interest of students in learning and
   developing their skills. The study then acquired various important
   characteristics from the existing literature in the area of research and
   selected the most common ones. Then, with the implementation of the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP), these features are assigned weights.
   For the ranking of the alternatives, the method of multi-objective
   optimization on the basis of research analysis was utilized. AI-based
   methods in music education have several advantages and are
   revolutionizing how students learn about and interact with music.
   Personalized learning, accessible education, improved practice and
   performance, help with composition and arrangement, and music theory and
   analysis are some of the main benefits.},

   Overview},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technology are expected to lead to a greater
   use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in industry, logistics,
   healthcare, etc. On the other hand, advances in artificial intelligence
   (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are becoming
   dominant solutions for processing large amounts of data from
   edge-synthesized heterogeneous sensors and drawing accurate conclusions
   with better understanding of the situation. Integration of the two areas
   WSN and AI has resulted in more accurate measurements, context-aware
   analysis and prediction useful for smart sensing applications. In this
   paper, a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in
   context-aware intelligent systems using sensor technology is provided.
   In addition, it also discusses the areas in which they are used, related
   challenges, motivations for adopting AI solutions, focusing on edge
   computing, i.e., sensor and AI techniques, along with analysis of
   existing research gaps. Another contribution of this study is the use of
   a semantic-aware approach to extract survey-relevant subjects. The
   latter specifically identifies eleven main research topics supported by
   the articles included in the work. These are analyzed from various
   angles to answer five main research questions. Finally, potential future
   research directions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {This article presents an effort toward building an artificial
   intelligence (AI) assisted framework, coined ReconGAN, for creating a
   realistic digital twin of the human vertebra and predicting the risk of
   vertebral fracture (VF). ReconGAN consists of a deep convolutional
   generative adversarial network (DCGAN), image-processing steps, and
   finite element (FE) based shape optimization to reconstruct the vertebra
   model. This DCGAN model is trained using a set of quantitative
   micro-computed tomography (micro-QCT) images of the trabecular bone
   obtained from cadaveric samples. The quality of synthetic trabecular
   models generated using DCGAN are verified by comparing a set of its
   statistical microstructural descriptors with those of the imaging data.
   The synthesized trabecular microstructure is then infused into the
   vertebra cortical shell extracted from the patient's diagnostic CT scans
   using an FE-based shape optimization approach to achieve a smooth
   transition between trabecular to cortical regions. The final geometrical
   model of the vertebra is converted into a high-fidelity FE model to
   simulate the VF response using a continuum damage model under
   compression and flexion loading conditions. A feasibility study is
   presented to demonstrate the applicability of digital twins generated
   using this AI-assisted framework to predict the risk of VF in a cancer
   patient with spinal metastasis.},

Abstract = {Although we have entered the new normal created by the COVID-19 crisis,
   few studies have offered guidance for the future of hospitality and
   tourism education. This study attempts to fill this gap by adopting two
   theories - curriculum theory and stakeholder theory. Thirty
   participants, consisting of hospitality and tourism students, faculty
   members, and industry professionals, were interviewed in focus groups.
   The results demonstrate curricula with a heavy emphasis on technology
   (artificial intelligence, virtual reality, or big data), marketing,
   culture/diversity, safety/crisis management, and entrepreneurship; and
   soft competencies focusing on creativity, self-confidence/positivity,
   self-care/wellness, critical thinking, leadership and teamwork. Many of
   these hard and soft skills reflect a greater need for new innovative
   business ideas and safety/health concerns in the post-COVID era. We hope
   these results serve as a foundation for educators and other stakeholders
   involved in setting plans and strategies for hospitality and tourism
   education in the years to come.},

Abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in the field of
   radiology is becoming more common. Several studies have demonstrated the
   potential utility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
   techniques as aids for radiologists to solve specific radiological
   challenges. The decision-making process, the establishment of specific
   clinical or radiological targets, the profile of the different
   professionals involved in the development of AI solutions, and the
   relation with partnerships and stakeholders are only some of the main
   issues that have to be faced and solved prior to starting the
   development of radiological AI solutions. Among all the players in this
   multidisciplinary team, the communication between radiologists and data
   scientists is essential for a successful collaborative work. There are
   specific skills that are inherent to radiological and medical training
   that are critical for identifying anatomical or clinical targets as well
   as for segmenting or labelling lesions. These skills would then have to
   be transferred, explained, and taught to the data science experts to
   facilitate their comprehension and integration into ML or DL algorithms.
   On the other hand, there is a wide range of complex software packages,
   deep neural-network architectures, and data transfer processes for which
   radiologists need the expertise of software engineers and data
   scientists in order to select the optimal manner to analyse and
   post-process this amount of data. This paper offers a summary of the top
   five challenges faced by radiologists and data scientists including tips
   and tricks to build a successful AI team. (C) 2020 The Royal College of

Abstract = {The availability of big data and computing power have triggered a big
   success in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field. Machine Learning (ML)
   becomes major highlights in AI due to the ability of self-improved as it
   is fed with more data. Therefore, Machine Learning is suitable to be
   applied in financial industry especially in detecting financial fraud
   which is one of the main challenges in financial system. In this paper,
   15 different types of supervised machine learning algorithms are studied
   in order to find the highest accuracy that should be able to detect
   credit card fraudulent transactions. The best algorithm among these
   algorithms is then further used and studied to find the correlation
   between the input variables and the accuracy of the results produced.
   The results have shown that Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) produced the
   highest accuracy among the 15 other algorithms with 98\% accuracy of
   detection. Besides that, the input parameters also play an important
   role in determining the accuracy of the results. Based on the result,
   when input parameter known as `V4' decreased, the recorded accuracy has
   increased to 99.17\%.},

Abstract = {India implemented a prolonged lockdown to contain the spread of
   COVID-19. Our study aimed to assess the mental health difficulties and
   influence of lockdown stressors among Indian higher education students'
   and employees of the government, private sector during the COVID-19
   lockdown. We collected the basic demographic, sleep generalised anxiety
   disorder (GAD), perceived stress scale (PSS) and sleep quality data from
   676 participants using a web-based cross-sectional survey. Among the
   participants, the overall prevalence of GAD and PSS were 22.9\%, 15.7\%
   (low), 79.4\% (medium), 4.7 (high), respectively. Younger participants
   reported higher GAD and PSS symptoms. Lockdown stressors have a
   significant correlation with GAD and PSS. In addition, the increased
   mobile phone usage significantly affects sleep latency, and sleep

Title = {Using artificial intelligence algorithms to predict rice (Oryza sativa
   L.) growth rate for precision agriculture},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {187},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rice growth rate prediction is crucial to achieve precision agriculture.
   In this study, growth data from three different rice cultivars at two
   different climate regions in Taiwan were used to calculate the rice
   growth rate (Gr) in key growth stages. A total of 10,246 Gr data from 95
   cultivations were used to assess the feasibility of simulating rice
   growth rate from ambient temperature by regression algorithm (REG),
   artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP).
   Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature
   and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice
   (Tr-all) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four
   distinctive growth stages (Tr-1 similar to 4). The results showed that
   the model output from Tr-1 similar to 4 are more accurate than Tr-all.
   However, simulation errors in the transitional stages occurred when the
   growth rate at different stages was modelled separately. Artificial
   intelligence based nonlinear models were more accurate than the
   regression model and ANN generally exhibited better performance than
   other two models. Compared with REG, the root mean squared error (RMSE)
   and mean absolute error (MAE) of averaged error-indays for the whole
   growth period decreased by 41.38\% and 42.81\% in ANN and 30.14\%, and
   31.21\% in GEP. Considering the potential errors in the transition
   stages and the high hardware demand for ANN, the GEP-Tr-all model is
   recommended for the rice growth rate modeling.},

Abstract = {Background: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common heart disease, with a
   relatively high prevalence of 4.9\% in the Framingham Heart Study.
   Because the prevalence increases with advancing age, an upward shift in
   the age distribution may increase the burden of AR. To provide an
   effective screening method for AR, we developed a deep learning-based
   artificial intelligence algorithm for the diagnosis of significant AR
   using electrocardiography (ECG). Methods: Our dataset comprised 29,859
   paired data of ECG and echocardiography, including 412 AR cases, from
   January 2015 to December 2019. This dataset was divided into training,
   validation, and test datasets. We developed a multi-input neural network
   model, which comprised a two-dimensional convolutional neural network
   (2D-CNN) using raw ECG data and a fully connected deep neural network
   (FC-DNN) us-ing ECG features, and compared its performance with the
   performances of a 2D-CNN model and other machine learning models. In
   addition, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)
   to identify which parts of ECG waveforms had the most effect on
   algorithm decision making. Results: The area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve of the multi-input model (0.802; 95\% CI,
   0.762-0.837) was significantly greater than that of the 2D-CNN model
   alone (0.734; 95\% CI, 0.679- 0.783; p < 0.001) and those of other
   machine learning models. Grad-CAM demonstrated that the multi -input
   model tended to focus on the QRS complex in leads I and aVL when
   detecting AR. Conclusions: The multi-input deep learning model using
   12-lead ECG data could detect significant AR with modest predictive
   value. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence algorithms for data analysis,
   characteristics, and metrics of scientific information resources are
   considered. In this paper, we discuss how metrics are related to
   assessment of scientific publication components and whether metrics are
   related to fundamental knowledge. It was noted that the characteristics
   of professional scientific activity are evaluated on the basis of
   metrics that are not related to the knowledge characteristics. The
   problem of knowledge extraction was studied on the basis of data
   verification by means of logical evidence-based schemes specified in the
   knowledge ontology. Properties of the modern stage of development of the
   knowledge space as a resource of artificial intelligence were noted. The
   transformation of artificial intelligence tasks into a new digital age
   was also analyzed. The insufficient use of artificial intelligence and
   machine learning methods in scientific bibliographic databases was
   emphasized, where quantitative scientometric indicators prevailed.
   Examples of ontological presentation of data and knowledge extraction
   are discussed and the special role of ontological approach to data
   structuring and knowledge extraction is highlighted.},

Abstract = {In this study, we work towards a strategy to measure and enhance the
   quality of interactions in discussion forums at scale. We present a
   machine learning (ML) model which identifies the phase of cognitive
   presence exhibited by a student's post and suggest future applications
   of such a model to help online students develop higher-order thinking.
   We collect discussion forum transcript data from two online courses:
   CS1301 (an introductory computer programming MOOC) offered by edX and
   CS6601 (a graduate course on artificial intelligence) which uses the
   Piazza online discussion tool. We manually code a random sample of
   students' posts based on the Community of Inquiry coding scheme and
   explore trends in cognitive presence within and across the courses. We
   further use this coded data to analyze the relationship between
   students' observed cognitive presence and course grades. In terms of
   testing and building an ML model, we use a Bidirectional Encoder
   Representations from Transformers model that uses a deep learning
   technique to train large text corpus and fine-tune the language model.
   Our results suggest that deeper cognitive engagement with course
   concepts, as expressed by higher cognitive presence, are associated with
   better learning outcomes for students in both course settings. Our ML
   approach achieves 92.5\% accuracy on the classification task, motivating
   the use of ML for instructional interventions in online courses. We
   expect that our research study will not only contribute to extending the
   literature on cognitive presence but also have a beneficial impact on
   online instructors or curriculum developers in higher education.},

Title = {Multi-task learning architecture for brain tumor detection and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Brain tumors have existed for a long time, but their rate is increasing
   among all age groups. Early detection is essential for timely prognosis
   as it is a dangerous and life-threatening disease. Since the advent of
   artificial intelligence and machine learning, different algorithms have
   been proposed to classify and segment brain tumors. However, all have
   their limitations when it comes to local deployment. The main drawback
   is designing multiple architectures for multiple tasks, which increases
   the time and computational complexity and affects performance. This
   paper addresses this drawback by proposing a multi-task learning (MTL)
   model that can take 2D-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images as input
   and gives predictions for multiple outputs such as detection and
   segmentation. It gives two outputs from one architecture: the system's
   efficiency. Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRaTs) 2019 and BRaTs 2020 dataset
   has been used to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental
   results show that the best model shows 98\% accuracy for detecting MRI
   images as either normal/abnormal, whereas an overall Dice score of 92\%
   for multi-class segmentation of high-grade glioma gliomas into the whole
   tumor, enhancing tumor and core tumor. The overall performance of the
   proposed architecture proves that it can be the best-suited framework
   for clinical setup. (c) 2022 SPIE and IS\&T},

Abstract = {Objectives To perform a systematic review of design and reporting of
   imaging studies applying convolutional neural network models for
   radiological cancer diagnosis. Methods A comprehensive search of PUBMED,
   EMBASE, MEDLINE and SCOPUS was performed for published studies applying
   convolutional neural network models to radiological cancer diagnosis
   from January 1, 2016, to August 1, 2020. Two independent reviewers
   measured compliance with the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in
   Medical Imaging (CLAIM). Compliance was defined as the proportion of
   applicable CLAIM items satisfied. Results One hundred eighty-six of 655
   screened studies were included. Many studies did not meet the criteria
   for current design and reporting guidelines. Twenty-seven percent of
   studies documented eligibility criteria for their data (50/186, 95\% CI
   21-34\%), 31\% reported demographics for their study population (58/186,
   95\% CI 25-39\%) and 49\% of studies assessed model performance on test
   data partitions (91/186, 95\% CI 42-57\%). Median CLAIM compliance was
   0.40 (IQR 0.33-0.49). Compliance correlated positively with publication
   year (rho = 0.15, p = .04) and journal H-index (rho = 0.27, p < .001).
   Clinical journals demonstrated higher mean compliance than technical
   journals (0.44 vs. 0.37, p < .001). Conclusions Our findings highlight
   opportunities for improved design and reporting of convolutional neural
   network research for radiological cancer diagnosis.},

Title = {Abnormal Behavior Recognition in Classroom Pose Estimation of College
   Students Based on Spatiotemporal Representation Learning},
Journal = {TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence and fifth generation (5G) technology are widely
   adopted to evaluate the classroom poses of college students, with the
   help of campus video surveillance equipment. To ensure the effective
   learning in class, it is important to detect and intervene in abnormal
   behaviors like sleeping and using cellphones in time. Based on
   spatiotemporal representation learning, this paper presents a deep
   learning algorithm to evaluate classroom poses of college students.
   Firstly, feature engineering was adopted to mine the moving trajectories
   of college students, which were used to determine student distribution
   and establish a classroom prewarning system. Then, k-means clustering
   (KMC) was employed for cluster analysis on different student groups, and
   identify the features of each group. For a specific student group, the
   classroom surveillance video was decomposed into several frames; the
   edge of each frame was extracted by edge detection algorithm, and
   imported to the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN).
   Experimental results show that our algorithm is 5\% more accurate than
   the benchmark three-dimensional CNN (C3D), making it an effective tool
   to recognize abnormal behaviors of college students in class.},

Title = {A novel two-dimensional echocardinarraphic image analysis system using

Volume = {49},

Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Objectives We sought to test the hypothesis that a novel 2-dimensional
   echocardiographic image analysis system using artificial
   intelligence-learned pattern recognition can rapidly and reproducibly
   calculate ejection fraction (EF).
   Background Echocardiographic EF by manual tracing is time consuming, and
   visual assessment is inherently subjective.
   Methods We studied 218 patients (72 female), including 165 with abnormal
   left ventricular (LV) function. Auto EF incorporated a database trained
   on > 10,000 human EF tracings to automatically locate and track the LV
   endocardium from routine grayscale digital cineloops and calculate EF in
   15 s. Auto EF results were independently compared with manually traced
   biplane Simpson's rule, visual EF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   in a subset.
   Results Auto EF was possible in 200 (92\%) of consecutive patients, of
   which 77\% were completely automated and 23\% required manual editing.
   Auto EF correlated well with manual EF (r = 0.98; 6\% limits of
   agreement) and required less time per patient (48 +/- 26 s vs. 102 21 s;
   p < 0.01). Auto EF correlated well with visual EF by expert readers (r =
   0.96; p < 0.001), but interobserver variability was greater (3.4 +/-
   2.9\% vs. 9.8 +/- 5.7\%, respectively; p < 0.001). Visual EF was less
   accurate by novice readers (r = 0.82; 19\% limits of agreement) and
   improved with trainee-operated Auto EF (r = 0.96; 7\% limits of
   agreement). Auto EF also correlated with MRI EF (n = 21) (r = 0.95; 12\%
   limits of agreement), but underestimated absolute volumes (r = 0.95;
   bias of -36 +/- 27 ml overall).
   Conclusions Auto EF can automatically calculate EF similarly to results
   by manual biplane Simpson's rule and MRI, with less variability than
   visual EF, and has clinical potential.},

   in Universities Based on Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {The development of precise teaching of civics with artificial
   intelligence not only is the realistic need of the development of the
   times and technological innovation but also provides a new picture to
   solve the problem of the relevance of civics, so it is the inevitable
   requirement for the quality and efficiency of civics teaching.
   Curriculum Civics is an important support for the cultivation of
   innovation ability of college students. To effectively identify the
   state categories of college students' psychology and civics and to fully
   consider the emotional factors between teachers and college students,
   this paper proposes a psychological civics teaching model based on
   graphical convolutional neural network. First, the dialog texts of
   psychology and civics teaching between teachers and students are coded
   in sequence context using Bi-GRU to obtain discourse text
   representations; then, a directed graph is constructed based on the
   order of the dialog between teachers and students in psychology and
   civics teaching, and a new text representation vector for each discourse
   text is obtained using graph convolutional neural network; finally, the
   two discourse representation vectors obtained are connected, and a
   similarity-based attention mechanism is used. Finally, the final
   discourse text representation is obtained using an attention-based
   mechanism to perform psychological and ideological state. The proposed
   method is conducive to the implementation of the teaching practice
   exploration of organic integration of ideals and beliefs with the
   cultivation of innovation ability in colleges and universities.},

Title = {Novel Machine Learning Approach to Predict and Personalize Length of
   Stay for Patients Admitted with Syncope from the Emergency Department},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Syncope, a common problem encountered in the emergency
   department (ED), has a multitude of causes ranging from benign to
   life-threatening. Hospitalization may be required, but the management
   can vary substantially depending on specific clinical characteristics.
   Models predicting admission and hospitalization length of stay (LoS) are
   lacking. The purpose of this study was to design an effective,
   exploratory model using machine learning (ML) technology to predict LoS
   for patients presenting with syncope. Methods: This was a retrospective
   analysis using over 4 million patients from the National Emergency
   Department Sample (NEDS) database presenting to the ED with syncope
   between 2016-2019. A multilayer perceptron neural network with one
   hidden layer was trained and validated on this data set. Results:
   Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) were determined for each of the
   five ANN models with varying cutoffs for LoS. A fair area under the
   curve (AUC of 0.78) to good (AUC of 0.88) prediction performance was
   achieved based on sequential analysis at different cutoff points,
   starting from the same day discharge and ending at the longest analyzed
   cutoff LoS <= 7 days versus >7 days, accordingly. The ML algorithm
   showed significant sensitivity and specificity in predicting short (<=
   48 h) versus long (>48 h) LoS, with an AUC of 0.81. Conclusions: Using
   variables available to triaging ED clinicians, ML shows promise in
   predicting hospital LoS with fair to good performance for patients
   presenting with syncope.},

Abstract = {Distance learning has been adopted as a very extended model during
   COVID-19-related confinement. It is also a methodology that can be
   applied in environments where people do not have easy access to schools.
   In this study, we automatically classify students as a function of their
   performance and we describe the best self-learning methodologies in
   distance learning, which will be useful both in confinement or for
   people with difficult access to schools. Due to the different learning
   scenarios provided by the different confinement conditions in the
   COVID-19 pandemic, we have performed the classification considering data
   before, during, and after COVID-19 confinement. Using a field experiment
   of 396 students, we have described the temporal evolution of students
   during all courses from 2016/2017 to 2020/2021. We have found that data
   obtained in the last month before the final exam of the subject include
   the most relevant information for a correct detection of students at
   risk of failure. On the other hand, students who obtain high scores are
   much easier to identify. Finally, we have concluded that the distance
   learning applied in COVID-19 confinement changed not only teaching
   strategies but also students' strategies when learning autonomously.},

Title = {The influence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on organisational
   culture: An empirical investigation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 24},
Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is known to transform and create
   opportunities for the world of work. However, little is known about how
   the future workforce, such as university students, are being equipped
   and exposed to 4IR technologies and ways of thinking in a South African
   (SA) context. This study's findings contribute to understanding the
   influence of organisational culture on the uptake of 4IR technology
   within higher education (HE) in SA during a pandemic. The study uses
   Edgar Schein's theoretical framework to explore the organisational
   culture at a university in the Gauteng province. The article responds
   further to the questions on how 4IR technology and principles are
   understood and applied within the context, and how to investigate to
   what extent the 4IR is reflected upon or embedded in the university's
   culture. A qualitative research design is used, and data are gathered
   through in-depth, semi-structured interviews from seven purposively
   selected academic and senior management staff members. Thematic analysis
   uncovered that the university's ambitious and competitive culture
   contributed to a positive uptake of 4IR technology and principles, even
   pre-COVID-19. Furthermore, the specific influence of the university's
   Vice-Chancellor to build 4IR thinking into the university helped shape
   more 4IR thinking and technologies, such as artificial intelligence,
   whilst still considering the existing disparities of SA, as a developing
   country.},

Title = {Influence of personality and modality on peer assessment evaluation
   perceptions using Machine Learning techniques},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {213},
Number = {C},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The successful instructional design of self and peer assessment in
   higher education poses several challenges that instructors need to be
   aware of. One of these is the influence of students' personalities on
   their intention to adopt peer assessment. This paper presents a
   quasi-experiment in which 85 participants, enrolled in the first-year of
   a Computer Engineering programme, were assessed regarding their
   personality and their acceptance of three modalities of peer assessment
   (individual, pairs, in threes). Following a within-subjects design, the
   students applied the three modalities, in a different order, with three
   different activities. An analysis of the resulting 1195 observations
   using ML techniques shows how the Random Forest algorithm yields
   significantly better predictions for three out of the four adoption
   variables included in the study. Additionally, the application of a set
   of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques shows that
   Agreeableness is the best predictor of Usefulness and Ease of Use, while
   Extraversion is the best predictor of Compatibility, and Neuroticism has
   the greatest impact on global Intention to Use. The discussion
   highlights how, as it happens with other innovations in educational
   processes, low levels of Consciousness is the most consistent predictor
   of resistance to the introduction of peer assessment processes in the
   classroom. Also, it stresses the value of peer assessment to augment the
   positive feelings of students scoring high on Neuroticism, which could
   lead to better performance. Finally, the low impact of the peer
   assessment modality on student perceptions compared to personality
   variables is debated.},

Title = {From guides to jugglers, from audience to outsiders: a metaphor analysis
   of synchronous hybrid learning},
Journal = {LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 15},
Abstract = {Synchronous hybrid learning (SHL) is a new instructional approach that
   allows on-site and remote students to participate in learning activities
   simultaneously. Investigating metaphorical perceptions about new
   learning environments may offer insights into the ways in which they are
   perceived by various stakeholders. Yet, research is missing a thorough
   investigation into metaphorical perceptions about hybrid learning
   environments. Hence, our goal was to determine and compare the
   metaphorical perceptions of higher education instructors and students
   regarding their roles in face-to-face versus SHL environments. When
   asked about SHL, participants were asked to refer separately to the
   on-site and remote student roles. Following the mixed-methods research
   design, data were obtained from 210 higher education instructors and
   students who responded to an online questionnaire during the 2021
   academic year. Findings showed that both groups perceived their roles
   differently in face-to-face versus SHL. For instructors, the ``guide{''}
   metaphor was replaced with the ``juggler{''} and the ``counselor{''}
   metaphors. For students, the ``audience{''} metaphor was replaced with
   different metaphors for each cohort of learners. The on-site students
   were described as an active audience, while the remote students were
   described as outsiders or observers. The meaning of these metaphors will
   be discussed in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teaching
   and learning in contemporary higher education.},

Abstract = {Major transformations in the sphere of the economy that Industry 4.0
   brings are also reflected in young people's expectations regarding the
   development of their professional career. Existing social relations are
   being modified nowadays and new concepts of building them are being
   developed. The aim of the present article is to present the
   expectations, fears and hopes of young people related to the course of
   Industrial Revolution 4.0 in the context of their future life. For a
   simpler perception of the research objectives of students, the research
   was narrowed down to the topic of building relationships with robots,
   which are one of the pillars of Industry 4.0. The research methods are
   based on the literature studies and an experiment conducted among the
   students graduating from economic faculties and entering a strongly
   changing labour market. The experiment was qualitative. The students
   wrote a short essay on the topic of whether a friendship between a human
   and a robot is possible. One group of students was shown a short
   emotional clip about the relationship between the boy and the robot.
   Regardless of the attempt to influence the message with a film, both
   groups of students hardly noticed the negative effects of digitisation
   on building relationships and social trust. The relationship between
   human being and advanced technology will develop in the future, which
   will result in the emergence of new relationships between humans and
   artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning using convolutional neural networks is the

   hinder successful matriculation. We employ conversational artificial
   intelligence (AI) to efficiently support thousands of would-be college
   freshmen by providing personalized, text message based outreach and
   guidance for each task where they needed support. We implemented and
   tested this system through a field experiment with Georgia State
   University (GSU). GSU-committed students assigned to treatment exhibited
   greater success with pre-enrollment requirements and were 3.3 percentage
   points more likely to enroll on time. Enrollment impacts are comparable
   to those in prior interventions but with substantially reduced burden on
   university staff Given the capacity for AI to learn over time, this
   intervention has promise for scaling personalized college transition
   guidance.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday interactions
   with pervasive digital systems. This development increasingly calls for
   citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational
   thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing
   several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9
   education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that
   the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical
   perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is
   particularly important when novices from both both early and higher
   education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by
   setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing,
   and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is
   integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper
   analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game
   rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from
   these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or
   are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum. The
   central discussion raised by the paper, is the nature of the integration
   between mathematics and PCT in these tasks. These resources provide
   opportunities for discussion of how we may better integrate PCT and
   mathematics from the perspective of both subjects to build a solid
   foundation for a critical understanding of AI interactions in future
   generations.},

Abstract = {The work is aimed at solving the problem of colleges and universities to
   expand the enrollment scale and optimize the management strategy. Based
   on grid management theory, wireless communication network, NET framework
   technology, and the browser/server (B/S) framework, a grid security
   management system is presented. Grid knowledge is explained, wireless
   communication network address calculation and analysis are mentioned,
   and NET framework technology and analysis of B/S framework technology
   optimized by C/S (client/server) framework technology are discussed. The
   grid management system is built on this foundation and applied to
   university management. Two questionnaires are designed to explore the
   grid management of students and faculty. Students believe that the
   system can effectively solve their management problems, and teachers and
   workers believe that the system can optimize their work. These results
   show that the grid management system can be applied to the management of
   colleges and universities, which provides some ideas for optimizing the
   management strategy of colleges and universities.},

Title = {Analysis of English Translation Model Based on Artificial Intelligence
   Attention Mechanism},
Journal = {MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {The particularity and quantity of English translation terms have a great
   impact on the quality and e,ect of machine translation and can not meet
   the requirements of English translation of terms. At the same time,
   technical exchange and communication in di,erent,elds need the
   expression of professional terms. In addition, although the neural
   machine translation model has good translation performance, it is not
   ideal for target languages with small translation needs and limited
   corpus resources. In order to solve the problems existing in the English
   translation model, this paper constructs the transformer model by
   replacing the cyclic neural network variables and introducing the
   attention mechanism. The term information is integrated into two
   pretraining models to improve the learning ability of model language
   sentence relationship. Maintain the integrity of terminology information
   by fully completing the training. The experimental results show that,
   compared with the other three term translation models, the translation
   model in this paper has the advantage of term information. At the same
   time, the deep neural network English term translation model can obtain
   more,ne-grained word relevance. In di,erent corpora, the Bleu score of
   the model is good, showing obvious translation performance advantages.
   This study provides a good professional reference value for the
   translation of English terms.},

Abstract = {Cheating attempts in educational assessments have long been observed.
   Because students today are characterized by their great digital
   intelligence, this negative conduct has intensified throughout the
   emergency remote teaching time. First, this article discusses the most
   innovative methods for combating cheating throughout the online
   evaluation procedure. Then, for this aim, a Convolutional Neural
   Networks for Cheating Detection System (CNNCDS) is presented.. The
   proposed solution has the advantage of not requiring the use of a
   camera, it recognizes and identifies IP addresses, records and analyzes
   exam sessions, and prevents internet browsing during exams. The
   K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) has been adopted as a classifier while the
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for exploratory data
   analysis and for making predictive models. The CNNCDS was learned,
   tested, and validated by using data extracted from a face-to-face exam
   session. its main output is a binary students' classification in
   real-time (normal or abnormal). The CNNCDS surpasses the fundamental
   classifiers Multi-class Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector
   Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) in
   terms of mean accuracy (98.5\%). Furthermore, it accurately detected
   screen pictures in an acceptable processing time, with a sensitivity
   average of 99.8 percent and a precision average of 1.8 percent. This
   strategy has been shown to be successful in minimizing cheating in
   several colleges. This solution is useful for higher education
   institutions that operate entirely online and do not require the use of
   a webcam.},

Abstract = {Quality control and assurance plays a fundamental role within higher
   education contexts. One means by which quality control can be performed
   is by mapping the course learning outcomes (CLOs) to the program
   learning outcomes (PLO). This paper describes a system by which this
   mapping process can be automated and validated. The proposed AI-based
   system automates the mapping process through the use of natural language
   processing. The framework underwent testing using two actual datasets
   from two educational programs, and the findings were promising. A
   testament to the potential of the suggested framework was the precision
   of the map-ping detected (83.1\% and 88.1\% for the two programs,
   respectively) compared to the mapping performed by the domain experts. A
   web-based tool was created to help teachers and administrators execute
   automatic mappings (https://dsaluaeu.github.io/ mapper.html). The data

Abstract = {Open Educational Resources (OER) have been researched for a long time in
   the open education field. Researchers are now shifting their focus from
   resources to practices for delivering open education, an area called
   Open Educational Practices (OEP). However, there is little information
   in the related literature regarding the design of an OEP-based course or
   the impact of these types of courses. Therefore, this study designs a
   new OEP-based course at a public university for teaching family
   education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also investigates its impact
   on learning motivation and teachers' perceptions. In this context, a
   practical pilot experiment using both qualitative and quantitative
   methods was conducted. Specifically, 36 learners participated in this
   experiment. The obtained findings highlight: (1) an innovative design
   framework for OEP-based courses that teachers can refer to in their
   contexts; (2) that learners had a high motivation level in terms of
   knowledge achievements, individual connection and engagement when taking
   the OEP-based course; and (3) several advantages and challenges of the
   OEP-based course from the teacher's and learners' perspectives. For
   instance, the teacher reported the fear of losing control over the
   learning process when applying OEP. The findings of this paper can help
   researchers and educators in adopting OEP in higher education especially
   in times of crises, as well as increase the sustainability of OEP, hence
   contributing to open education development.},

Abstract = {The complex shear modulus (G{*}) and phase angle (delta) are fundamental
   viscoelastic rheological properties used in the estimation of rutting
   and fatigue pavement distress in asphalt binder. In the tropical
   regions, rutting and fatigue cracking are major pavement distress
   affecting the serviceability of road infrastructure. Laboratory testing
   of the complex shear modulus and phase angle requires expensive and
   advanced equipment that is not obtainable in major laboratories within
   the developing countries of the region, giving rise to the need for an
   accurate predictive model to support quality pavement design. This
   research aims at developing a predictive model for the estimation of
   rutting and fatigue susceptive of asphalt binder at intermediate and
   high pavement temperatures. Asphalt rheological and ageing test was
   conducted on eight mixes of modified binders used to build the study
   database containing 1976 and 1668 data points for rutting and fatigue
   parameters respectively. The database was divided into training and
   simulation dataset. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm was
   used to predict the rutting and fatigue parameters using unaged and aged
   conditioned inputs. The proposed GPR was compared with the support
   vector machine (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and artificial
   neural network (ANN) models. Results show that the model performed
   better in the estimation of rutting parameter than the fatigue
   parameter. Further, unaged input variables show better reliability in
   the prediction of fatigue parameter.},

Abstract = {Skin cancers occur commonly worldwide. The prognosis and disease burden
   are highly dependent on the cancer type and disease stage at diagnosis.
   We systematically reviewed studies on artificial intelligence and
   machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms that aim to facilitate the early
   diagnosis of skin cancers, focusing on their application in primary and
   community care settings. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of
   Science (from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 9, 2021) for all studies providing
   evidence on applying AI/ML algorithms to the early diagnosis of skin
   cancer, including all study designs and languages. The primary outcome
   was diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms for skin cancers. The
   secondary outcomes induded an overview of AI/ML methods, evaluation
   approaches, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to patients and
   clinicians. We identified 14 224 studies. Only two studies used data
   from clinical settings with a low prevalence of skin cancers. We
   reported data from all 272 studies that could be relevant in primary
   care. The primary outcomes shoe ed reasonable mean diagnostic accuracy
   for melanoma (89.5\% {[}range 59.7-100\%]), squamous cell carcinoma
   (85.3\% {[}71.0-97.8\%]), and basal cell carcinoma (87.6\% {[}70. 0-99.
   7\%]). The secondary outcomes showed a heterogeneity of AI/ML methods
   and study designs, with high amounts of incomplete reporting (eg,
   patient demographics and methods of data collection). Few studies used
   data on populations with a low prevalence of skin cancers to train and
   test their algorithms; therefore, the widespread adoption into community
   and primary care practice cannot currently be recommended until efficacy
   in these populations is shown. We did not identify any health economic,
   patient, or dinician acceptability data for any of the included studies.
   We propose a methodological cheddist for use in the development of new
   AI/ML algorithms to detect skin cancer, to facilitate their design,
   evaluation, and implementation.},

Abstract = {The human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for most cervical cancer
   cases worldwide. This gynecological carcinoma causes many deaths, even
   though it can be treated by removing malignant tissues at a preliminary
   stage. In many developing countries, patients do not undertake medical
   examinations due to the lack of awareness, hospital resources and high
   testing costs. Hence, it is vital to design a computer aided diagnostic
   method which can screen cervical cancer patients. In this research, we
   predict the probability risk of contracting this deadly disease using a
   custom stacked ensemble machine learning approach. The technique
   combines the results of several machine learning algorithms on multiple
   levels to produce reliable predictions. In the beginning, a deep
   exploratory analysis is conducted using univariate and multivariate
   statistics. Later, the one-way ANOVA, mutual information and Pearson's
   correlation techniques are utilized for feature selection. Since the
   data was imbalanced, the Borderline-SMOTE technique was used to balance
   the data. The final stacked machine learning model obtained an accuracy,
   precision, recall, F1-score, area under curve (AUC) and average
   precision of 98\%, 97\%, 99\%, 98\%, 100\% and 100\%, respectively. To
   make the model explainable and interpretable to clinicians, explainable
   artificial intelligence algorithms such as Shapley additive values
   (SHAP), local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME), random
   forest and ELI5 have been effectively utilized. The optimistic results
   indicate the potential of automated frameworks to assist doctors and
   medical professionals in diagnosing and screening potential cervical
   cancer patients.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the paper is to determine the perspectives of
   diversification of educational services in the conditions of industry
   4.0 on the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) training, determine the
   consequences of this process for academic and teaching staff and to
   develop recommendations for its practical implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach The methods of horizontal, trends and
   regression analysis are used for studying social consequences of digital
   modernization of the markets of higher education (for academic and
   teaching staff). The research is performed by the example of modern
   Russia on the basis of the statistical data of Federal State Statistics
   Service and the International Telecommunication Union. The timeframe of
   the research covers academic years 2000/2001-2018/2019. Findings It is
   determined that digital modernization of the sphere of higher education
   stimulates the reduction of the universities' need for academic and
   teaching staff and growth of their unemployment. However, further
   digital modernization of economy on the basis of breakthrough
   technologies of industry 4.0 will lead to creation of a new type of
   educational services that are provided within entrepreneurship of
   universities - AI training of business. This will ensure development of
   university entrepreneurship (and reduction of dependence of universities
   on state financing), as well as growth of the employment opportunities
   for experts (academic and teaching staff) in the sphere of AI, which
   will not depend on the number of students, but will be connected to
   demand for AI training from digital business. Originality/value The role
   of AI training in the structure of production business processes of a
   university in the conditions of industry 4.0 is determined. The
   necessity for state stimulation of development of digital business in
   the modern economic systems is substantiated. It is shown that
   government has to pay close attention to the issues of support in the
   sphere of AI and mass distribution of their results. Because of this, it
   will be possible to control social risks in the sphere of higher
   education.},

Abstract = {Educational institutions are undergoing an internal process of strategic
   transformation to adapt to the challenges caused by the growing impact
   of digitization and the continuous development of student and labor
   market expectations. Consequently, it is essential to obtain more
   accurate knowledge of students to improve their learning experience and
   their relationship with the educational institution, and in this way
   also contribute to evolving those students' skills that will be useful
   in their next professional future. For this to happen, the entire
   academic community faces obstacles related to data capture, analysis,
   and subsequent activation. This article establishes a methodology to
   design, from a business point of view, the application in educational
   environments of predictive machine learning models based on Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), focusing on the student and their experience when
   interacting physically and emotionally with the educational ecosystem.
   This methodology focuses on the educational offer, relying on a taxonomy
   based on learning objects to automate the construction of analytical
   models. This methodology serves as a motivating backdrop to several
   challenges facing educational institutions, such as the exciting
   crossroads of data fusion and the ethics of data use. Our ultimate goal
   is to encourage education experts and practitioners to take full
   advantage of applying this methodology to make data-driven decisions
   without any preconceived bias due to the lack of contrasting
   information.},

Title = {Fostering Graduate Employability: Rethinking Tanzania's University
   Practices},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Globalization, partly spurred by technological innovation such as
   artificial intelligence and robotics, continues to disrupt not only
   economic trajectories and business models, especially in the developed
   world, but also the knowledge and skill requirements for graduates
   entering the labor market. A growing corpus of literature on graduates'
   employability has identified barriers to employment ranging from skills
   mismatch to a lack of soft skills. Although the literature on graduate
   employability is informative and illuminating, the role of university
   practices in fostering graduate employability in sub-Saharan Africa, and
   Tanzania in particular, has been less studied. Drawing on the broader
   employability literature, this article provides a comprehensive analysis
   of the best university practices in an effort to address the
   unemployment problems of university graduates in sub-Saharan Africa and
   Tanzania in particular. Four critical university best practices for
   fostering graduate employability are of interest-developing effective
   university-industry partnerships, aligning university education with a
   country's development plans, regular university curriculum reviews, and
   strengthening quality assurance systems. Therefore, this article
   contributes to the higher education literature on the role of university
   practices in fostering graduate employability.},

Abstract = {The development of stereo matching algorithm is still one of the
   challenging problems, especially in illposed regions. Hence, this
   article presents a survey on the algorithm frameworks related to the
   stereo matching algorithm. Based on the early survey that had been
   conducted, two major frameworks available in current stereo matching
   algorithm development, they are traditional and artificial intelligence
   (AI) frameworks. Most of the traditional methods are very low accuracy
   compared to the AI-based approach. This can be observed in the standard
   benchmarking dataset, such as from the KITTI and the Middlebury, where
   AI methods rank at the top of the accuracy list. Additionally, the trend
   for solving computer vision problems uses AI or machine learning tools
   that become more apparent in recent years. Thus, this paper is focusing
   on the survey between the deep learning frameworks, which is one of the
   machine learning tools related to the convolutional neural network
   (CNN). Several mixed approaches between CNN based method and traditional
   handcraft method, as well as the end to end CNN method also discussed in
   this paper. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {In the article, questions about the features of training future teachers
   of natural sciences in modern higher education in the context of modern
   neurosciences are highlighted.It was found that highly qualified and
   competent teachers are the key to successful higher education. The
   concept of ``neuroscience{''} is investigated. Publications and books of
   domestic and foreign scientists on the training of future teachers of
   natural disciplines in the view of neurosciences are highlighted. The
   application of methodological approaches in teaching future teachers of
   natural disciplines is noted. The branch of neuro-andragogy, which is
   important for adult learning is considered. It is noted that university
   teachers should enrich the educational process with modern strategies in
   order to meet the needs of future student teachers. It is noted that
   future teachers are interested in mastering knowledge of neurosciences,
   because they understand that this will help them in their professional
   activities. It has been proven that many scientists argue that education
   cannot exist today without neurosciences. The facts that have a special
   impact on the work of the child's body and on learning have been
   clarified: energy supply, nutrition, stress resistance and environmental
   pollution. A study of approbation of foreign programs ``Scheme of
   education and neuroscience{''} and ``Science of the brain in motion{''}
   was carried out. It was found that students are interested in knowledge
   about the work of their own brain and try to work on themselves to help
   the body improve its performance.It is noted that scientists argue that
   for the activity of the brain to be productive, it is necessary for the
   neurons, synapse and myelin to work in a balanced way.It was proven that
   COVID - 19 pandemic to negatively impacted education. It was found that
   physical activity and the activity of cognitive functions are an
   integral link. Emphasis is placed on the pedagogy of partnership, which
   will promote close cooperation of teachers, children and parents and
   help parents to preserve the health of the child.},

Abstract = {The last few years have witnessed an upsurge in the number of studies
   using Machine and Deep learning models to predict vital academic
   outcomes based on different kinds and sources of student-related data,
   with the goal of improving the learning process from all perspectives.
   This has led to the emergence of predictive modelling as a core practice
   in Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The aim of this study
   is to review the most recent research body related to Predictive
   Analytics in Higher Education. Articles published during the last decade
   between 2012 and 2022 were systematically reviewed following PRISMA
   guidelines. We identified the outcomes frequently predicted in the
   literature as well as the learning features employed in the prediction
   and investigated their relationship. We also deeply analyzed the process
   of predictive modelling, including data collection sources and types,
   data preprocessing methods, Machine Learning models and their
   categorization, and key performance metrics. Lastly, we discussed the
   relevant gaps in the current literature and the future research
   directions in this area. This study is expected to serve as a
   comprehensive and up-to-date reference for interested researchers
   intended to quickly grasp the current progress in the Predictive
   Learning Analytics field. The review results can also inform educational
   stakeholders and decision-makers about future prospects and potential
   opportunities.},

Abstract = {Our understanding of human health may be significantly enhanced in the
   near future because of the unprecedented volume of digitized health care
   data and the availability of artificial intelligence to mine these data

   traditional methods to generate and test hypotheses. Another way to
   generate research hypotheses is to use big data to reveal patterns and

   Health unveiled its Strategic Plan for Data Science, which includes a
   far-reaching plan for the use of big data to stimulate new research
   discoveries. Both researchers and physicians will need to learn and
   apply new skills in understanding the use of artificial intelligence and
   other tools, as well as in the direct application of data collection and

Title = {Bayesian Inference and Dynamic Neural Feedback Promote the Clinical
   Application of Intelligent Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis},
Journal = {ENGINEERING},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of infant death. An
   artificial intelligence (AI)-based CHD diagnosis network (CHDNet) is an
   echocardiogram video-based binary classification model that judges
   whether echocardiogram videos contain heart defects. Existing CHDNets
   have shown performances comparable to or even better than medical
   experts, but their unreliability on cases outside of the training set
   has become the main bottleneck for their deployment. This is a common
   problem for most AI-based diagnostic approaches. Here, to overcome this
   challenge, we present two essential mechanisms-Bayesian inference and
   dynamic neural feedback-to respectively measure and improve the
   diagnostic reliability of AI. The former easily makes the neural network
   output its reliability instead of a single prediction result, while the
   latter is a computational neural feedback cell that allows the neural
   network to feed knowledge from the output layer back to the shallow
   layers and enables the neural network to selectively activate relevant
   neurons. To evaluate the effectiveness of these two mechanisms, we
   trained CHDNets on 4151 echocardiogram videos containing three common
   CHD defects and tested them on an internal test set of 1037
   echocardiogram videos and an external set of 692 videos that were newly
   collected from other cardiovascular imaging devices. Each echocardiogram
   video corresponds to a unique patient and a unique visit. We demonstrate
   on various neural network architectures how the reliability obtained by
   Bayesian inference interprets and quantifies the significant performance
   difference between internal and external test sets of neural networks,
   and how the devised feedback cell helps the neural networks to maintain
   high accuracy and reliability, despite the input being corrupted by
   noise or when using an external test set.\& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {After entering the first decade of the new century, information
   technology has brought some profound changes in all aspects of social
   life. In the field of education, teaching mode to teaching concept has
   been severely impacted. Especially in the more open university
   classroom, the changes brought about by this shock are more pronounced.
   Classrooms of all majors have ushered in a wave of innovation. The use
   of cutting-edge information technology to build efficient classrooms has
   become the direction of multidisciplinary efforts. While promoting the
   upgrading of ideological and political classroom teaching in colleges
   and universities, it has become a common topic for ideological and
   political teachers in colleges and universities to effectively promote
   the effectiveness of ideological and political classroom teaching. In
   order to investigate the current teaching recognition of ideological and
   political courses in colleges and universities and the need for courses
   to integrate new technologies, this study used questionnaire survey and
   group comparison analysis as the main methods to distribute online
   questionnaires to 621 students from 6 colleges and universities in
   Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. It is divided into students' interest in
   ideological and political courses and the interest of teaching content.
   According to the analysis of previous literature, a control group
   experiment of ideological and political courses is designed. The
   experimental results show that after wireless communication and
   artificial intelligence technology are combined with ideological and
   political courses, students' learning is more efficient. Finally,
   according to the results of experiments and questionnaires, the problems
   existing in the current teaching of ideological and political courses in
   colleges and universities are summarized, and then, innovative reform
   suggestions for the teaching methods of ideological and political
   courses are put forward.},

Abstract = {The trend of gamification in online education has grown as technological
   advancements allow for more digitized learning environments to create
   interactive and engaging learning experiences. Learners are motivated in
   various ways, which necessitates an understanding of gamification
   mechanics and dynamics that produce enjoyment to adapt them to a variety
   of factors such as personality, needs, values, and motivations of each
   learner. Furthermore, exploration and advancement in the field of
   artificial intelligence (AI) allow us to provide an intelligent adaptive
   gamification environment. The aim of this study is to review the
   existing literature on adaptive gamification in e-learning, as well as
   to highlight the scoops and future challenges of adaptive gamification
   applications. The present research followed the literature review
   method. For the data collected in this study, we used a qualitative
   approach. This paper presents in the first part a literature review of
   studies and a synthesis of the literature on the application of adaptive
   gamification in online education. The second part deals with the use of
   AI with adaptive gamification in online education and proposes its
   different techniques and future adaptation.},

Title = {Earliest Possible Global and Local Interpretation of Students'
   Performance in Virtual Learning Environment by Leveraging Explainable AI},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {129843-129864},
Abstract = {In this research study, we propose an Explainable Artificial
   Intelligence (XAI) model that provides the earliest possible global and
   local interpretation of students' performance at various stages of
   course length. Global and local interpretation is provided in such a way
   that the prediction accuracy of a single local observation is close to
   the model's overall prediction accuracy. For the earliest possible
   understanding of student performance, local and global interpretation is
   provided at 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% of course length. Machine
   Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) which are subfields of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) have recently emerged to assist all educational
   institution's in predicting the performance, engagement, and dropout
   rate of online students. Unfortunately, traditional ML and DL techniques
   lack in providing data analysis results in an understandable human way.
   Explainable AI (XAI), a new branch of AI, can be used in educational
   settings, specifically in VLEs, to provide the instructor with the study
   performance results of thousands or even millions of online students in
   a human-understandable way. Thus, unlike black box approaches such as
   traditional ML and DL techniques, XAI can help instructors to interpret
   the strengths and weaknesses of an individual student, providing them
   with timely personalized feedback and guidance. Various traditional and
   various ensemble ML algorithms were trained on demographic, clickstream,
   and assessment features to determine which algorithm gives the best
   performance result. The best-performing ML algorithm was ultimately
   selected and provided to the XAI model as an input for local and global
   interpretation of students' study behavior at various percentages of
   course length. We have used various XAI tools to give students'
   performance reports to instructors, in an explicable human way, at
   different stages of course length. The intermediate data analysis and
   performance reports will help instructors and all key stakeholders in
   decision-making and optimally facilitate online students.},

Title = {The use of deep learning towards dose optimization in low-dose computed
   tomography: A scoping review},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {208-214},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction: Low-dose computed tomography tends to produce lower image
   quality than normal dose computed tomography (CT) although it can help
   to reduce radiation hazards of CT scanning. Research has shown that
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially deep learning can
   help enhance the image quality of low-dose CT by denoising images. This
   scoping review aims to create an overview on how AI technologies,
   especially deep learning, can be used in dose optimisation for low-dose
   CT.
   Methods: Literature searches of ProQuest, PubMed, Cinahl, ScienceDirect,
   EbscoHost Ebook Collection and Ovid were carried out to find research
   articles published between the years 2015 and 2020. In addition, manual
   search was conducted in SweMed+, SwePub, NORA, Taylor \& Francis Online
   and Medic.
   Results: Following a systematic search process, the review comprised of
   16 articles. Articles were organised according to the effects of the
   deep learning networks, e.g. image noise reduction, image restoration.
   Deep learning can be used in multiple ways to facilitate dose
   optimisation in low-dose CT. Most articles discuss image noise reduction
   in low-dose CT.
   Conclusion: Deep learning can be used in the optimisation of patients'
   radiation dose. Nevertheless, the image quality is normally lower in
   low-dose CT (LDCT) than in regular-dose CT scans because of smaller
   radiation doses. With the help of deep learning, the image quality can
   be improved to equate the regulardose computed tomography image quality.
   Implications to practice: Lower dose may decrease patients' radiation
   risk but may affect the image quality of CT scans. Artificial
   intelligence technologies can be used to improve image quality in
   low-dose CT scans. Radiologists and radiographers should have proper
   education and knowledge about the techniques used. (C) 2021 The College

   autoethnographic study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 19},
Abstract = {ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model introduced in
   November 2022, is potentially applicable in many contexts, including
   higher education. Although academics are already using it to draft
   papers or develop search queries for systematic reviews, its use as a
   tool aiding the learning process has not been examined. To address this
   research gap, I conducted an autoethnographic study examining my
   experience using ChatGPT as a more knowledgeable other that scaffolded
   my learning about a particular topic-the technical aspects of how
   ChatGPT works. Overall, ChatGPT provided me with enough content to form
   a general idea of its technical aspects, and I experienced its feedback
   as motivating and relevant. However, the answers were somewhat
   superficial, the text it generated was not always consistent or logical
   and sometimes contradictory. The instantaneous replies to my questions
   contributed to an experience of a `flow'. Being `in the zone' also meant
   I overestimated my knowledge and understanding, as I could not detect
   the contradictory responses it provided `on the spot'. I conclude that
   caution is advised when ChatGPT is used as a learning aid, as we learn
   more about its capabilities and limitations and how humans tend to
   perceive and interact with these technologies.},

Title = {A Machine Learning Approach for 5G SINR Prediction},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are envisaged to
   play key roles in 5G networks. Efficient radio resource management is of
   paramount importance for network operators. With the advent of newer
   technologies, infrastructure, and plans, spending significant radio
   resources on estimating channel conditions in mobile networks poses a
   challenge. Automating the process of predicting channel conditions can
   efficiently utilize resources. To this point, we propose an ML-based
   technique, i.e., an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting SINR
   (Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio) in order to mitigate the radio
   resource usage in mobile networks. Radio resource scheduling is
   generally achieved on the basis of estimated channel conditions, i.e.,
   SINR with the help of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS). The proposed
   Non-Linear Auto Regressive External/Exogenous (NARX)-based ANN aims to
   minimize the rate of sending SRS and achieves an accuracy of R = 0.87.
   This can lead to vacating up to 4\% of the spectrum, improving bandwidth
   efficiency and decreasing uplink power consumption.},

Title = {Emerging Complexity in Distributed Intelligent Systems},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Distributed intelligent systems (DIS) appear where natural intelligence
   agents (humans) and artificial intelligence agents (algorithms)
   interact, exchanging data and decisions and learning how to evolve
   toward a better quality of solutions. The networked dynamics of
   distributed natural and artificial intelligence agents leads to emerging
   complexity different from the ones observed before. In this study, we
   review and systematize different approaches in the distributed
   intelligence field, including the quantum domain. A definition and
   mathematical model of DIS (as a new class of systems) and its
   components, including a general model of DIS dynamics, are introduced.
   In particular, the suggested new model of DIS contains both natural
   (humans) and artificial (computer programs, chatbots, etc.) intelligence
   agents, which take into account their interactions and communications.
   We present the case study of domain-oriented DIS based on different
   agents' classes and show that DIS dynamics shows complexity effects
   observed in other well-studied complex systems. We examine our model by
   means of the platform of personal self-adaptive educational assistants
   (avatars), especially designed in our University. Avatars interact with
   each other and with their owners. Our experiment allows finding an
   answer to the vital question: How quickly will DIS adapt to owners'
   preferences so that they are satisfied? We introduce and examine in
   detail learning time as a function of network topology. We have shown
   that DIS has an intrinsic source of complexity that needs to be
   addressed while developing predictable and trustworthy systems of
   natural and artificial intelligence agents. Remarkably, our research and
   findings promoted the improvement of the educational process at our
   university in the presence of COVID-19 pandemic conditions.},

Abstract = {The larynx, or the voice-box, is a common site of occurrence of Head and
   Neck cancers. Yet, automated segmentation of the larynx has been
   receiving very little attention. Segmentation of organs is an essential
   step in cancer treatment-planning. Computed Tomography scans are
   routinely used to assess the extent of tumor spread in the Head and Neck
   as they are fast to acquire and tolerant to some movement. This paper
   reviews various automated detection and segmentation methods used for
   the larynx on Computed Tomography images. Image registration and deep
   learning approaches to segmenting the laryngeal anatomy are compared,
   highlighting their strengths and shortcomings. A list of available
   annotated laryngeal computed tomography datasets is compiled for
   encouraging further research. Commercial software currently available
   for larynx contouring are briefed in our work. We conclude that the lack
   of standardisation on larynx boundaries and the complexity of the
   relatively small structure makes automated segmentation of the larynx on
   computed tomography images a challenge. Reliable computer aided
   intervention in the contouring and segmentation process will help
   clinicians easily verify their findings and look for oversight in
   diagnosis. This review is useful for research that works with artificial
   intelligence in Head and Neck cancer, specifically that deals with the
   segmentation of laryngeal anatomy.},

Title = {Machine learning-based classification and diagnosis of clinical
   cardiomyopathies},
Journal = {PHYSIOLOGICAL GENOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},
Number = {9},
Pages = {391-400},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) are two
   common types of cardiomyopathies leading to heart failure. Accurate
   diagnostic classification of different types of cardiomyopathies is
   critical for precision medicine in clinical practice. In this study, we
   hypothesized that machine learning (ML) can be used as a novel
   diagnostic approach to analyze cardiac transcriptomic data for
   classifying clinical cardiomyopathies. RNA-Seq data of human left
   ventricle tissues were collected from 41 DCM patients, 47 ICM patients,
   and 49 nonfailure controls (NF) and tested using five ML algorithms:
   support vector machine with radial kernel (svmRadial), neural networks
   with principal component analysis (pcaNNet), decision tree (DT), elastic
   net (ENet), and random forest (RF). Initial ML classifications achieved
   similar to 93\% accuracy (svmRadial) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 82\%
   accuracy (RF) for NF vs. ICM, and similar to 80\% accuracy (ENet and
   svmRadial) for DCM vs. ICM. Next, 50 highly contributing genes (HCGs)
   for classifying NF and DCM, 68 HCGs for classifying NF and ICM, and 59
   HCGs for classifying DCM and ICM were selected for retraining ML models.
   Impressively, the retrained models achieved similar to 90\% accuracy
   (RF) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 90\% accuracy (pcaNNet) for NF vs. ICM,
   and similar to 85\% accuracy (pcaNNet and RF) for DCM vs. ICM. Pathway
   analyses further confirmed the involvement of those selected HCGs in
   cardiac dysfunctions such as cardiomyopathies, cardiac hypertrophies,
   and fibrosis. Overall, our study demonstrates the promising potential of
   using artificial intelligence via ML modeling as a novel approach to
   achieve a greater level of precision in diagnosing different types of
   cardiomyopathies.},

Title = {Understanding continuance intention of artificial intelligence
   (AI)-enabled mobile banking applications: an extension of AI
   characteristics to an expectation confirmation model},
Journal = {HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to be a disruptive
   financial technology in the context of mobile banking that can provide
   more practical value to users and banks. AI is a critical way of
   facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications
   (apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users'
   continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not
   been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation
   model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a
   research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI
   characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived
   anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users' continuance
   intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a
   random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least
   squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that
   both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction
   via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users'
   willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers
   theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking
   research and provides practical guidance to app developers with respect
   to designing and developing proper mobile banking apps using AI
   technology.},

Title = {Systematic Review of Artificial Intelligence for Abnormality Detection
   in High-volume Neuroimaging and Subgroup Meta-analysis for Intracranial
   Hemorrhage Detection},
Journal = {CLINICAL NEURORADIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 1},
Abstract = {PurposeMost studies evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) models that
   detect abnormalities in neuroimaging are either tested on
   unrepresentative patient cohorts or are insufficiently well-validated,
   leading to poor generalisability to real-world tasks. The aim was to
   determine the diagnostic test accuracy and summarise the evidence
   supporting the use of AI models performing first-line, high-volume
   neuroimaging tasks.MethodsMedline, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of
   Science were searched until September 2021 for studies that temporally
   or externally validated AI capable of detecting abnormalities in
   first-line computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR)
   neuroimaging. A bivariate random effects model was used for
   meta-analysis where appropriate. This study was registered on PROSPERO
   as CRD42021269563.ResultsOut of 42,870 records screened, and 5734
   potentially eligible full texts, only 16 studies were eligible for
   inclusion. Included studies were not compromised by unrepresentative
   datasets or inadequate validation methodology. Direct comparison with
   radiologists was available in 4/16 studies and 15/16 had a high risk of
   bias. Meta-analysis was only suitable for intracranial hemorrhage
   detection in CT imaging (10/16 studies), where AI systems had a pooled
   sensitivity and specificity 0.90 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   0.85-0.94) and 0.90 (95\% CI 0.83-0.95), respectively. Other AI studies
   using CT and MRI detected target conditions other than hemorrhage
   (2/16), or multiple target conditions (4/16). Only 3/16 studies
   implemented AI in clinical pathways, either for pre-read triage or as
   post-read discrepancy identifiers.ConclusionThe paucity of eligible
   studies reflects that most abnormality detection AI studies were not
   adequately validated in representative clinical cohorts. The few studies
   describing how abnormality detection AI could impact patients and
   clinicians did not explore the full ramifications of clinical
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper examines some of the many problems and issues associated with
   integrating new and developing technologies into the education of future

   both commercial designers and educators on how best to keep track and

   tertiary education where the introduction of new cutting edge technology
   is often encouraged. Although this is generally achieved through the
   feedback of research activity, integrating new concepts at an
   appropriate level is a major task. Of particular concern is how focussed
   areas of applied technology can be made part of the multidisciplinary
   scope of design education.
   The paper describes the model used to introduce areas of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI) to undergraduate industrial design students. The
   successful interaction of research and education within a UK higher
   education establishment are discussed and project examples given. It is
   shown that, through selective tuition of research topics and appropriate
   technical support, innovative design solutions can result. In addition,
   it shows that by introducing leading edge and, in some cases,
   underdeveloped technology, specific key skills of independent learning,
   communication and research methods can be encouraged.},

Abstract = {Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery and
   development (DDD) has gained more traction in the past few years. Many
   scientific reviews have already been made available in this area. Thus,
   in this review, the authors have focused on the success stories of
   AI-driven drug candidates and the scientometric analysis of the
   literature in this field. Area covered The authors explore the
   literature to compile the success stories of AI-driven drug candidates
   that are currently being assessed in clinical trials or have
   investigational new drug (IND) status. The authors also provide the
   reader with their expert perspectives for future developments and their
   opinions on the field. Expert opinion Partnerships between AI companies
   and the pharma industry are booming. The early signs of the impact of AI
   on DDD are encouraging, and the pharma industry is hoping for
   breakthroughs. AI can be a promising technology to unveil the greatest
   successes, but it has yet to be proven as AI is still at the embryonic
   stage.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Radiology-pathology correlation has long been foundational to
   continuing education, peer learning, quality assurance, and
   multidisciplinary patient care. The objective of this study was to
   determine whether modern deep-learning language-modeling techniques
   could reliably match pathology reports to pertinent radiology reports.
   Methods: The recently proposed Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for
   Text Classification methodology was used. Two hundred thousand radiology
   and pathology reports were used for adaptation to the
   radiology-pathology space. One hundred thousand candidate
   radiology-pathology pairs, evenly split into match and no-match
   categories, were used for training the final binary classification
   model. Matches were defined by a previous-generation artificial
   intelligence anatomic concept radiology-pathology correlation system.
   Results: The language model rapidly adapted very closely to the prior
   anatomic concept-matching approach, with 100\% specificity, 65.1\%
   sensitivity, and 73.7\% accuracy. For comparison, the previous
   methodology, which was intentionally designed to be specific at the
   expense of sensitivity, had 98.0\% specificity, 65.1\% sensitivity, and
   73.2\% accuracy.
   Conclusions: Modern deep-learning language-modeling approaches are
   promising for radiology-pathology correlation. Because of their rapid
   adaptation to underlying training labels, these models advance previous
   artificial intelligence work in that they can be continuously improved
   and tuned to improve performance and adjust to user and site-level
   preference.},

   Modeling Analysis of Global AI Curricula},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {933-965},
Abstract = {The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is not new, with
   discussions going back at least 40 years. Teaching the principles and
   requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part
   of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught
   at several higher-education institutions around the globe including
   content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a
   generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in
   teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the
   courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity
   and specificity according to Bloom's taxonomy. In this exploratory study
   based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166
   courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from
   Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able
   to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build,
   Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course
   content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in
   charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this
   teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from
   these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program
   coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may
   expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought
   and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND LEARNING PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This paper explores the academic integrity considerations of students'
   use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools using Large Language Models
   (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in formal assessments. We examine the evolution
   of these tools, and highlight the potential ways that LLMs can support
   in the education of students in digital writing and beyond, including
   the teaching of writing and composition, the possibilities of
   co-creation between humans and AI, supporting EFL learners, and
   improving Automated Writing Evaluations (AWE). We describe and
   demonstrate the potential that these tools have in creating original,
   coherent text that can avoid detection by existing technological methods
   of detection and trained academic staff alike, demonstrating a major
   academic integrity concern related to the use of these tools by
   students. Analysing the various issues related to academic integrity
   that LLMs raise for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and
   students, we conclude that it is not the student use of any AI tools
   that defines whether plagiarism or a breach of academic integrity has
   occurred, but whether any use is made clear by the student. Deciding
   whether any particular use of LLMs by students can be defined as
   academic misconduct is determined by the academic integrity policies of
   any given HEI, which must be updated to consider how these tools will be
   used in future educational environments.},

Title = {ChatGPT for Sample-Size Calculation in Sports Medicine and Exercise
   Sciences: A Cautionary Note},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS PHYSIOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 3},
Abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the accuracy of ChatGPT (Chat generative
   pretrained transformer), a large language model, in calculating sample
   size for sport-sciences and sports-medicine research studies. Methods:
   We conducted an analysis on 4 published papers (ie, examples 1-4)
   encompassing various study designs and approaches for calculating sample
   size in 3 sportscience and -medicine journals, including 3 randomized
   controlled trials and 1 survey paper. We provided ChatGPT with all
   necessary data such as mean, percentage SD, normal deviates (Z \&
   alpha;/2 and Z1-\& beta;), and study design. Prompting from 1 example
   has subsequently been reused to gain insights into the reproducibility
   of the ChatGPT response. Results: ChatGPT correctly calculated the
   sample size for 1 randomized controlled trial but failed in the
   remaining 3 examples, including the incorrect identification of the
   formula in one example of a survey paper. After interaction with
   ChatGPT, the correct sample size was obtained for the survey paper.
   Intriguingly, when the prompt from Example 3 was reused, ChatGPT
   provided a completely different sample size than its initial response.
   Conclusions: While the use of artificial-intelligence tools holds great
   promise, it should be noted that it might lead to errors and
   inconsistencies in sample-size calculations even when the tool is fed
   with the necessary correct information. As artificial-intelligence
   technology continues to advance and learn from human feedback, there is
   hope for improvement in sample-size calculation and other research
   tasks. However, it is important for scientists to exercise caution in
   utilizing these tools. Future studies should assess more
   advanced/powerful versions of this tool (ie, ChatGPT4).},

Journal = {ANGIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 3},
Abstract = {The aim of this review is to introduce some applications of artificial
   intelligence (AI) algorithms for the detection and quantification of
   coronary stenosis using computed tomography angiography (CTA). The
   realization of automatic/semi-automatic stenosis detection and
   quantification includes the following steps: vessel central axis
   extraction, vessel segmentation, stenosis detection, and quantification.
   Many new AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, have
   been widely used in medical image segmentation and stenosis detection.
   This review also summarizes the recent progress regarding coronary
   stenosis detection and quantification, and discusses the development
   trends in this field. Through evaluation and comparison, researchers can
   better understand the research frontier in related fields, compare the
   advantages and disadvantages of various methods, and better optimize the
   new technologies. Machine learning and deep learning will promote the
   process of automatic detection and quantification of coronary artery
   stenosis. However, the machine learning and the deep learning methods
   need a large amount of data, so they also face some challenges because
   of the lack of professional image annotations (manually add labels by
   experts).},

Title = {Application of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in
   the numerical investigation of Cu/water nanofluid convective flow},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is an applicable tool
   for the prediction of fluid flow characteristics (velocity, temperature,
   pressure, etc.). However, CFD requires a lot of time, computational
   efforts and as a result, much more expenses for complicated cases (e.g.
   turbulent flow, 3-dimensional calculations, etc.). The present work
   tries to conduct an investigation on the potential of the artificial
   intelligence algorithms in overcoming such barriers of CFD modeling.
   Turbulent forced convection of Cu/water nanofluid in a tube under
   constant heat flux is considered as a case study for the model
   development. The density and viscosity of the based fluid are enhanced
   by the suspension of the nanoparticles. This makes more pressure drop
   and as a result, imposes more pumping power. So, this paper is focused
   on a way to facilitate the prediction of the pressure of the nanofluid
   convective flow. The results of the CFD modeling are learned by the
   adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), as the artificial
   intelligence method. The CFD modeling is done for several Cu
   nanoparticle volume fractions (i.e. 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1, and 2). Several
   types of variables as inputs (i.e. x, y, z, and nanoparticle volume
   fraction) and different kinds of membership functions (i.e. Generalized
   bell-shaped membership function (gbellmf), Gaussian membership function
   (gaussmf), Gaussian combination membership function (gauss2mf),
   Difference between two sigmoidal membership functions (dsigmf), Product
   of two sigmoidal membership functions (psigmf)) are examined until the
   intelligence requirements of the ANFIS are satisfied. Once the best
   intelligence of ANFIS has been achieved, there is no need for
   complicated CFD modeling. The ANFIS predictions show the highest
   compatibility with the CFD results. The maximum pressure drop was
   predicted around 1500 Pa. The results also revealed that for checking
   the intelligence condition the coefficient of determination (R-2) is not
   solely sufficient and the error values must be considered as well.
   Considering the gauss2mf as the membership function and the nanoparticle
   volume fraction as the fourth input, the ANFIS could distinguish
   intelligently the pattern of data (changing the pressure with
   coordinates and particle fraction). For the best intelligence, the mean
   standard error was around zero, while the coefficient of determination
   was close to one. At this condition, the pressure of the nanofluid could
   be determined as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction and
   anywhere inside the tube without using the CFD modeling.},

   Teaching Evaluation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},

Abstract = {The rise of knowledge economy has drawn much attention to Innovation and
   Entrepreneurship Education (IEE). IEE is conducive to helping graduates
   relieve employment pressure, and also to cultivating students'
   innovation ability and entrepreneurial willingness, which is also of
   great significance for promoting high-quality quantitative and
   sustainable development of social economy. However, the current IEE
   still has some limitations, such as the students' insufficient
   entrepreneurial willingness, low innovation practice ability, and
   unreasonable evaluation methods of innovation and entrepreneurship
   teaching, which hinder the further development of IEE. Therefore, for
   the purpose of further promoting the development of IEE, this article
   studied the evaluation of innovation and entrepreneurship teaching, and
   proposed an innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation system
   combining Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Deep Learning (DL). The
   evaluation system was used to evaluate the innovation and
   entrepreneurship teaching of Class A and Class B. The evaluation result
   showed that Class A's innovation and entrepreneurship teaching
   evaluation score was 7; Class B's innovation and entrepreneurship
   teaching evaluation score was 7.1. The evaluation of innovation and
   entrepreneurship teaching in Class A and Class B was still not high
   enough, and the teaching quality and effect still needed to be improved;
   the innovation and entrepreneurship teaching evaluation system combined
   with HCI and DL had strong operability.},

Abstract = {Technology has made life simpler for every human being, irrespective of
   educational qualifications and sector of work. The education sector in
   the current modern era is revolutionized by technology. Teaching and
   understanding theoretical subjects like ideological and pedagogical
   education (IaPE) has become simple with technologies like artificial
   intelligence (AI), edge computing (EC), and flipped classrooms. These
   are unique technologies in the education sector to make classroom
   learning more manageable by creating concepts in digitization and
   visualization with audiovisual technologies. In recent research, many
   authors have proposed models for IaPE through ideological and
   pedagogical teaching (IaPT) for different courses in vocational colleges
   and universities. Some researchers have designed a hybrid model with
   IaPT and analyzed the results as an extension to this teaching method.
   This research work introduced AI and EC technologies to the flipped
   classroom to promote higher vocational education in colleges and
   universities for IaPE. With digitization and visualization in course
   material preparation, AI aids in an interactive classroom study. On the
   other hand, EC aids in the easy storage and accessing of the resources
   prepared through AI. The analysis work is performed on the dataset from
   the unique client identifier (UCI) repository by proposing a novel
   optimization algorithm for flipped classrooms.},

Month = {JUN 14},
Abstract = {With the development of communication technology and hardware
   technology, only continuous innovation in animation production can meet
   the development needs of the times. Animation has recently received
   substantial interest in special education. New forms of representation,
   including animation, multimedia, and virtual reality, are some of the
   key developments that education technology has made possible. Animation
   software is an influential mass media, communication, and education
   platform. Progressive improvements in technical methods along with the
   expansion of knowledge and skills have resulted in an increase in
   variety as well as the speed of production of new products for
   animation. In this study, we propose an Advanced Animation Teaching
   Model (AATM) based on Design-Oriented Learning Approach (DOLA).
   Design-based learning is the incorporation of design projects in
   classrooms so that students can acquire creative solutions and learn
   curriculum content by participating in actual, cross-curricular
   challenges. This model keeps pace with the times to meet the needs of
   the modern market. It combines introduction to animation, color
   composition, color psychology, composition basis, spatial perspective,
   animation scene design, and visual art design-related theories to form
   the theoretical basis for the major. The results showed the trends of
   animation used in education and the strengths of animation to improve
   the learning of students and enhance the thinking ability of the

   for better regulation, concerning safety, privacy regulatory strategy is
   heading towards a better framework. Different regulatory authorities
   like China, Europe, and United States (US) have adopted Al for economic
   and policy aspects. Emerging countries are using these tools for
   administrative work. US has begun implementing frameworks for Al
   adaptation, research, and development. The Al policy strategy started in
   2016 with a series of workshops conducted under the Obama
   administration. Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also
   published draft guidance for regulatory oversight of Al and Machine

Abstract = {The emergence of hybrid intelligent systems by combining artificial
   intelligence (AI) algorithms with classical modeling paradigms such as
   mechanistic modeling and agent-based models might facilitate the
   predictive ability of existing models. The scientific community still
   needs to resolve the lack of transparency and reporting of AI for code
   reproducibility.
   Lay Summary Data analytics have evolved remarkably. This paper discussed
   the evolution of data analytics from a competitive advantage perspective
   within academia and illustrated the combination of different advanced
   technological systems in developing hybrid intelligent mechanistic
   models (HIMM). Data analytics tools are divided into 3 stages. The first
   stage (collect and respond) ensures that data are correct and free of
   influential data points, and it represents the data and information
   phases for which data are cataloged and organized. The second stage
   (predict and prescribe) results in gained knowledge from the data and
   comprises most predictive modeling paradigms, and optimization and risk
   assessment tools are used to prescribe future decision-making
   opportunities. The third stage (smart learning and policy making) aims
   to apply the information obtained in the previous stages to foment
   knowledge and use it for rational decisions. Although still incipient,
   HIMM form the forthcoming stage of competitive advantage. HIMM may not
   increase our ability to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling
   the outcomes of a system, but it may increase the predictive ability of
   existing models by helping the analyst explain more of the data
   variation. The scientific community needs to resolve the lack of
   transparency and reporting of artificial intelligence for code
   reproducibility.
   A renewed interest in data analytics and decision support systems in
   developing automated computer systems is facilitating the emergence of
   hybrid intelligent systems by combining artificial intelligence (AI)
   algorithms with classical modeling paradigms such as mechanistic
   modeling (HIMM) and agent-based models (iABM). Data analytics have
   evolved remarkably, and the scientific community may not yet fully grasp
   the power and limitations of some tools. Existing statistical
   assumptions might need to be re-assessed to provide a more thorough
   competitive advantage in animal production systems towards
   sustainability. This paper discussed the evolution of data analytics
   from a competitive advantage perspective within academia and illustrated
   the combination of different advanced technological systems in
   developing HIMM. The progress of analytical tools was divided into three
   stages: collect and respond, predict and prescribe, and smart learning
   and policy making, depending on the level of their sophistication
   (simple to complicated analysis). The collect and respond stage is
   responsible for ensuring the data is correct and free of influential
   data points, and it represents the data and information phases for which
   data are cataloged and organized. The predict and prescribe stage
   results in gained knowledge from the data and comprises most predictive
   modeling paradigms, and optimization and risk assessment tools are used
   to prescribe future decision-making opportunities. The third stage aims
   to apply the information obtained in the previous stages to foment
   knowledge and use it for rational decisions. This stage represents the
   pinnacle of acquired knowledge that leads to wisdom, and AI technology
   is intrinsic. Although still incipient, HIMM and iABM form the
   forthcoming stage of competitive advantage. HIMM may not increase our
   ability to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the outcomes
   of a system, but it may increase the predictive ability of existing
   models by helping the analyst explain more of the data variation. The
   scientific community still has some issues to be resolved, including the
   lack of transparency and reporting of AI that might limit code
   reproducibility. It might be prudent for the scientific community to
   avoid the shiny object syndrome (i.e., AI) and look beyond the current
   knowledge to understand the mechanisms that might improve productivity
   and efficiency to lead agriculture towards sustainable and responsible
   achievements.},

Abstract = {Motivation: With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, the
   study of the genetic composition of living organisms has become more
   accessible for researchers. Several advances have been achieved because
   of it, especially in the health sciences. However, many challenges which
   emerge from the complexity of sequencing projects remain unsolved. Among
   them is the task of assembling DNA fragments from previously unsequenced
   organisms, which is classified as an NP-hard (nondeterministic
   polynomial time hard) problem, for which no efficient computational
   solution with reasonable execution time exists. However, several tools
   that produce approximate solutions have been used with results that have
   facilitated scientific discoveries, although there is ample room for
   improvement. As with other NP-hard problems, machine learning algorithms
   have been one of the approaches used in recent years in an attempt to
   find better solutions to the DNA fragment assembly problem, although
   still at a low scale.
   Results: This paper presents a broad review of pioneering literature
   comprising artificial intelligence-based DNA assemblers-particularly the
   ones that use machine learning-to provide an overview of
   state-of-the-art approaches and to serve as a starting point for further
   study in this field.},

Abstract = {Advances in technical radiotherapy have resulted in significant sparing
   of organs at risk (OARs), reducing radiation-related toxicities for
   patients with cancer of the head and neck (HNC). Accurate delineation of
   target volumes (TVs) and OARs is critical for maximising tumour control
   and minimising radiation toxicities. When performed manually,
   variability in TV and OAR delineation has been shown to have significant
   dosimetric impacts for patients on treatment. Auto-segmentation (AS)
   techniques have shown promise in reducing both inter-practitioner
   variability and the time taken in TV and OAR delineation in HNC.
   Ultimately, this may reduce treatment planning and clinical waiting
   times for patients. Adaptation of radiation treatment for biological or
   anatomical changes during therapy will also require rapid re-planning;
   indeed, the time taken for manual delineation currently prevents
   adaptive radiotherapy from being implemented optimally. We are therefore
   standing on the threshold of a transformation of routine radiotherapy
   planning via the use of artificial intelligence. In this article, we
   outline the current state-of-the-art for AS for HNC radiotherapy in
   order to predict how this will rapidly change with the introduction of
   artificial intelligence. We specifically focus on delineation accuracy
   and time saving. We argue that, if such technologies are implemented
   correctly, AS should result in better standardisation of treatment for
   patients and significantly reduce the time taken to plan radiotherapy.

Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Detection of early esophageal cancer is important to improve patient's
   survival, but accurate diagnosis of superficial esophageal neoplasms is
   difficult even for experienced endoscopists. Computer-aided diagnostic
   system is believed to be an important method to provide accurate and
   rapid assistance for endoscopists in diagnosing esophageal neoplasms. We
   developed a single-shot multibox detector using a convolutional neural
   network for diagnosing esophageal cancer by using endoscopic images and
   the aim of our study was to assess the ability of our system. Our system
   showed good diagnostic performance in detecting as well as
   differentiating esophageal neoplasms and the accuracy can achieve 90\%.
   Differentiating different histological grades of esophageal neoplasm is
   usually conducted by magnified endoscopy and we confirm that artificial
   intelligence system has great potential for helping endoscopists in
   accurately diagnosing superficial esophageal neoplasms without the
   necessity of magnified endoscopy and experienced endoscopists.
   Diagnosis of early esophageal neoplasia, including dysplasia and
   superficial cancer, is a great challenge for endoscopists. Recently, the
   application of artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning in the
   endoscopic field has made significant advancements in diagnosing
   gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we constructed a
   single-shot multibox detector using a convolutional neural network for
   diagnosing different histological grades of esophageal neoplasms and
   evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of this computer-aided system. A total
   of 936 endoscopic images were used as training images, and these images
   included 498 white-light imaging (WLI) and 438 narrow-band imaging (NBI)
   images. The esophageal neoplasms were divided into three
   classifications: squamous low-grade dysplasia, squamous high-grade
   dysplasia, and squamous cell carcinoma, based on pathological diagnosis.
   This AI system analyzed 264 test images in 10 s, and the sensitivity,
   specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of this system in detecting
   esophageal neoplasms were 96.2\%, 70.4\%, and 90.9\%, respectively. The
   accuracy of this AI system in differentiating the histological grade of
   esophageal neoplasms was 92\%. Our system showed better accuracy in
   diagnosing NBI (95\%) than WLI (89\%) images. Our results showed the
   great potential of AI systems in identifying esophageal neoplasms as
   well as differentiating histological grades.},

Title = {Decision support system (DSS) for traffic prediction and building a

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL \& THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},

Abstract = {Recently, the increasing rapid number of cars on the roads and the great
   demand for traffic prediction, because of the increase in traffic
   congestion, has posed a great challenge to governments' economic
   development and social stability of most countries in the world. While
   many challenges are facing governments to solve traffic congestion and
   reduce car accidents and pollution, the objective of this study is to
   apply a dynamic approach for the Jordanian community to lessen traffic
   congestion on the roads in Amman by utilising social media, artificial
   intelligence efficiency methods, and decision support to lessen traffic
   issues in the capital city of Jordan. It also aims to communicate
   directly with social media users to cut down on the time and effort
   needed to make traffic predictions, which will help to relieve the
   congestion of areas and roads in Amman. To obtain the research aims, we
   handled a TRF2021JOR dataset related to traffic records in Amman city,
   collected from Amman Municipality for several years. Then, we applied
   the Netnography model, which was built using the data science concepts,
   to create an efficient model in Amman city for traffic prediction and
   time series based on selective features of previous congestion in city
   roads. The experiment results showed the accuracy preference for the
   proposed method in Amman city. Furthermore, the experiment tested the
   accuracy of results based on the machine learning methods using the
   KNIME Analytics Platform tool, one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI)
   methods used; the experiment results showed that the classifier SVM
   gives a low accuracy reached (89.9\%). However, the accuracy using the
   decision tree classifier reached (90.59\%), while the classifier random
   forest gives a high accuracy reached (93.16\%).},

Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Technological evolution has contributed to considerable changes in the
   learning methods used today. If a few years ago, before the
   technological boom, students relied only on their memory capacity, on
   notes on sheets of paper and written materials (in the form of course
   materials, books, or textbooks), today the process of learning is
   significantly facilitated by the means and techniques involved in the
   use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, smartphones, and
   tablets, which are rapidly replacing bulky desktop computers and
   outdated textbooks used in the learning process. Moreover, blockchain
   technology can also be used as a motivational factor for developing
   learning abilities by implementing a system that can bring students
   credit points convertible into cryptocurrencies or online badges.
   Studies conducted in the field show that students' motivation for
   learning and creativity is significantly improved with the help of this
   reward system. In this article, two specialized studies were conducted
   (in Romania), one on the perception of teachers in the university
   environment towards the use of new technologies in the learning process
   (artificial intelligence, smartphones, and tablets), and the other on
   the perception of students on the technological integration of
   blockchain (by implementing a system that can bring students credit
   points convertible into cryptocurrencies or online badges to certify
   their knowledge) in the learning process and measuring their
   satisfaction.},

   microscopy for biomedical imaging},
Journal = {SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {331},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence algorithms that aid mini-microscope imaging are
   attractive for numerous applications. In this paper, we optimize
   artificial intelligence techniques to provide clear, and natural
   biomedical imaging. We demonstrate that a deep learning-enabled
   super-resolution method can significantly enhance the spatial resolution
   of mini-microscopy and regular-microscopy. This data-driven approach
   trains a generative adversarial network to transform low-resolution
   images into super-resolved ones. Mini-microscopic images and
   regular-microscopic images acquired with different optical microscopes
   under various magnifications are collected as our experimental benchmark
   datasets. The only input to this generative-adversarial-network-based
   method are images from the datasets down-sampled by the Bicubic
   interpolation. We use independent test sets to evaluate this deep
   learning approach with other deep learning-based algorithms through
   qualitative and quantitative comparisons. To clearly present the
   improvements achieved by this generative-adversarial-network-based
   method, we zoom into the local features to explore and highlight the
   qualitative differences. We also employ the peak signal-to-noise ratio
   and the structural similarity, to quantitatively compare alternative
   super-resolution methods. The quantitative results illustrate that
   super-resolution images obtained from our approach with interpolation
   parameter alpha = 0.25 more closely match those of the original
   high-resolution images than to those obtained by any of the alternative
   state-of-the-art method. These results are significant for fields that
   use microscopy tools, such as biomedical imaging of engineered living
   systems. We also utilize this generative adversarial network-based
   algorithm to optimize the resolution of biomedical specimen images and
   then generate three-dimensional reconstruction, so as to enhance the
   ability of three-dimensional imaging throughout the entire volumes for
   spatial-temporal analyses of specimen structures. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI: A transfer learning-based approach
   for rotating machinery exploiting augmented synthetic data},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost
   reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring
   rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of
   the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data
   (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset's operating
   condition. Three major problems hinder the application of AI models in
   industrial environments, being the motivation for the research: (i)
   impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational
   conditions (since faults rarely happen), (ii) high cost of experts to
   label all acquired data (in a supervised scenario) and (iii) lack of
   interpretability of the models (black-boxes). To overcome these
   problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying
   faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented
   synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namely
   FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide
   scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are
   created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation.
   The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
   with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the post hoc
   interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and
   increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only
   obtained promising diagnostic performance but was also able to learn
   characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source
   domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results
   obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults
   suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer
   learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial intelligence for
   fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster
   research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become
   important tools for environmental scientists and engineers, both in
   research and in applications. Although these methods have become quite
   popular in recent years, they are not new. The use of AI methods began
   in the 1950s and environmental scientists were adopting them by the
   1980s. Although an ``AI winter{''} temporarily slowed the growth, a more
   recent resurgence has brought it back with gusto. This paper tells the
   story of the evolution of AI in the field through the lens of the AMS
   Committee on Artificial Intelligence Applications to Environmental
   Science. The environmental sciences possess a host of problems amenable
   to advancement by intelligent techniques. We review a few of the early
   applications along with the ML methods of the time and how their
   progression has impacted these sciences. While AI methods have changed
   from expert systems in the 1980s to neural networks and other
   data-driven methods, and more recently deep learning, the environmental
   problems tackled have remained similar. We discuss the types of
   applications that have shown some of the biggest advances due to AI
   usage and how they have evolved over the past decades, including topics
   in weather forecasting, probabilistic prediction, climate estimation,
   optimization problems, image processing, and improving forecasting
   models. We finish with a look at where AI as employed in environmental
   science appears to be headed and some thoughts on how it might be best
   blended with physical/dynamical modeling approaches to further advance
   our science.},

Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {The rapid development of educational informatization has brought great
   challenges to college English Language Teaching, and the traditional
   classroom education mode can no longer meet the needs of today's college
   English Language Teaching. Therefore, College English Language Teaching
   should strengthen the construction of mixed education mode and
   effectively combine online education with offline education. ``Output
   oriented approach{''} is a new foreign language education theory
   constructed by Chinese scholars, which has attracted extensive attention
   of foreign language scholars and front-line teachers, and is expected to
   solve the problem of ``separation of learning and application{''} of
   College English in China. In order to build a bridge between theory and
   practice, this study adopts the method of action research to explore and
   optimize the implementation of ``output-oriented approach{''} in real
   college English Language Teaching situations in H stages, collect and
   analyze qualitative (student feedback, peer evaluation) or quantitative
   data (language test, output text), explore the education effect while
   making the theory ``fall to the ground,{''} and review the theory from
   the perspective of practice to supplement and enrich it. In this study,
   the original linear education process of ``output-oriented method{''}
   was reconstructed, and a new education process model was established,
   which made it more instructive in practice.},

Abstract = {Enabling college graduates to achieve career success is increasingly
   considered a major responsibility of universities. Many studies have
   developed models of predicting students' career decisions and have
   sought to provide appropriate treatments or early support for students
   to achieve this goal. Most studies, however, have focused on using
   institutional data, which might not be entirely sufficient for the
   prediction because students' career decisions might also be affected by
   the social context. This study proposes a data-driven approach that
   considers both institutional data and social media news for predicting
   students' career decisions. The results of this study suggest that such
   an approach achieved a higher performance in the prediction task. This
   study also discusses the data-driven approach as a means of supporting
   students' career development in the university setting, how the approach
   can be used to inform educators on how to use the data that are both
   internal and external to the university, and what the impact of this
   approach is on educational support decisions.},

Abstract = {The overall success of educational institutions can be measured by the
   success of its students. Providing factors that increase success rate
   and reduce the failure of students is profoundly helpful to educational
   organizations. Data mining is the best solution to finding hidden
   patterns and giving suggestions that enhance the performance of
   students. This paper presents a model based on decision tree algorithms
   and suggests the best algorithm based on performance. Three built
   classifiers (J48, Random Tree and REPTree) were used in this model with
   the questionnaires filled in by students. The survey consists of 60
   questions that cover the fields, such as health, social activity,
   relationships, and academic performance, most related to and affect the
   performance of students. A total of 161 questionnaires were collected.
   The Weka 3.8 tool was used to construct this model. Finally, the J48
   algorithm was considered as the best algorithm based on its performance
   compared with the Random Tree and RepTree algorithms.},

Abstract = {Object recognition and tracking is a challenge for underwater vehicles.
   Traditional algorithm requires a clear feature definition, which suffers
   from uncertainty as the variation of occlusion, illumination, season and
   viewpoints. A deep learning approach requires a large amount of training
   data, which suffers from the computation. The proposed method is to
   avoid the above drawbacks. The Siamese Region Proposal Network tracking
   algorithm using two weights sharing is applied to track the target in
   motion. The key point to overcome is the one-shot detection task when
   the object is unidentified. Various complex and uncertain environment
   scenarios are applied to evaluate the proposed system via the deep
   learning model's predictions metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, P-R
   curve, F1 score). The tracking rate based on Siamese Region Proposal
   Network Algorithm is up to 180 FPS.},

Title = {Application Value of Multimedia Artificial Intelligence Technology in
   English Teaching Practice},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {NOV 19},
Abstract = {Since the 1980s, with the continuous deepening of penetration of reform
   and liberalization, there has been scientific and technological
   development. In such an environment, the traditional teaching model of
   colleges and universities posed new challenges and put forward higher
   requirements for English teaching practice. To enhance the performance
   of English instruction, this article applies a multiple media technique
   to start English education practice; firstly, through the study of the
   current English teaching mode, it analyzes the specific needs of
   teachers and students and designs the functions to meet their specific
   needs. Secondly, combined with multimedia technology and network
   technology, a multimedia English practice teaching platform was designed
   and implemented. In this way, the overall educational efficiency has
   been increased by nearly 30\%, and the acceptance of the model by
   students has been increased by 35\%. Finally, this paper constructs a
   small multimedia piano practice teaching platform for testing and proves
   the practicability and usefulness of multimedia synthesis technology in
   English education practice through comparison with traditional English
   teaching effects. Experiments show that the adoption of multimedia
   artificial smart technology in English education has a remarkable impact
   on enhancing the result of English teaching, can stimulate students'
   learning enthusiasm, and realize the reform of English teaching.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence in fracture detection: transfer learning from
   deep convolutional neural networks},
Journal = {CLINICAL RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Number = {5},
Pages = {439-445},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {AIM: To identify the extent to which transfer learning from deep
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pre-trained on non-medical images,
   can be used for automated fracture detection on plain radiographs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The top layer of the Inception v3 network was
   re-trained using lateral wrist radiographs to produce a model for the
   classification of new studies as either ``fracture{''} or ``no
   fracture{''}. The model was trained on a total of 11,112 images, after
   an eightfold data augmentation technique, from an initial set of 1,389
   radiographs (695 ``fracture{''} and 694 ``no fracture{''}). The training
   data set was split 80:10:10 into training, validation, and test groups,
   respectively. An additional 100 wrist radiographs, comprising 50
   ``fracture{''} and 50 ``no fracture{''} images, were used for final
   testing and statistical analysis.
   RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)
   for this test was 0.954. Setting the diagnostic cut-off at a threshold
   designed to maximise both sensitivity and specificity resulted in values
   of 0.9 and 0.88, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The AUC scores for this test were comparable to
   state-of-the-art providing proof of concept for transfer learning from
   CNNs in fracture detection on plain radiographs. This was achieved using
   only a moderate sample size. This technique is largely transferable, and
   therefore, has many potential applications in medical imaging, which may
   lead to significant improvements in workflow productivity and in
   clinical risk reduction. (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Abstract = {The last decade have witnessed the unprecedented development of
   information and communication technologies. This has, in turn, enabled
   the growth and development of other sectors, such as, for example, that
   of distance and on-line learning. In this context of technological
   expansion in education it is appropriate to reflect pedagogically about
   technological resources and their educational purpose. That is, how to
   deploy the available technological resources and media in a fashion
   consistent with the desired educational objectives and aims. Virtual
   Service-Learning has emerged as a particular modality of this
   methodology that combines and reinforces two elements: technology
   applied to education and service as a pedagogic tool. This format then,
   reveals itself as an appropriate methodology through which to channel
   both technical and pedagogic innovation. In this work and, taking as
   reference a study focusing on two virtual Service-Learning projects, we
   will address the construction of a theoretical framework that will allow
   us to understand and improve the development of these practices through
   this pedagogic modality.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence MacHIne learning for the detection and treatment
   of atrial fibrillation guidelines in the emergency department setting
   (AIM HIGHER): Assessing a machine learning clinical decision support

Abstract = {Objective Advanced machine learning technology provides an opportunity
   to improve clinical electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, allowing
   non-cardiology clinicians to initiate care for atrial fibrillation (AF).
   The Lucia Atrial Fibrillation Application (Lucia App) photographs the
   ECG to determine rhythm detection, calculates CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED
   scores, and then provides guideline-recommended anticoagulation. Our
   purpose was to determine the rate of accurate AF identification and
   appropriate anticoagulation recommendations in emergency department (ED)
   patients ultimately diagnosed with AF. Methods We performed a
   single-center, observational retrospective chart review in an urban
   California ED, with an annual census of 70,000 patients. A convenience
   sample of hospitalized patients with AF as a primary or secondary
   discharge diagnosis were evaluated for accurate ED AF diagnosis and ED
   anticoagulation rates. This was done by comparing the Lucia App against
   a gold standard board-certified cardiologist diagnosis and using the
   American College of Emergency Physicians AF anticoagulation guidelines.
   Results Two hundred and ninety seven patients were enrolled from January
   2016 until December 2019. The median age was 79 years and 44.1\% were
   female. Compared to the gold standard diagnosis, the Lucia App detected
   AF in 98.3\% of the cases. Physicians recommended guideline-consistent
   anticoagulation therapy in 78.5\% versus 98.3\% for the Lucia App. Of
   the patients with indications for anticoagulation and discharged from
   the ED, only 25.0\% were started at discharge. Conclusion Use of a
   cloud-based ECG identification tool can allow non-cardiologists to
   achieve similar rates of AF identification as board-certified
   cardiologists and achieve higher rates of guideline-recommended
   anticoagulation therapy in the ED.},

Abstract = {Researches in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have achieved many important
   breakthroughs, especially in recent years. In some cases, AI learns
   alone from scratch and performs human tasks faster and better than
   humans. With the recent advances in AI, it is natural to wonder whether
   Artificial Neural Networks will be used to successfully create or break
   cryptographic algorithms. Bibliographic review shows the main approach
   to this problem have been addressed throughout complex Neural Networks,
   but without understanding or proving the security of the generated
   model. This paper presents an analysis of the security of cryptographic
   algorithms generated by a new technique called Adversarial Neural
   Cryptography (ANC). Using the proposed network, we show limitations and
   directions to improve the current approach of ANC. Training the proposed
   Artificial Neural Network with the improved model of ANC, we show that
   artificially intelligent agents can learn the unbreakable One-Time Pad
   (OTP) algorithm, without human knowledge, to communicate securely
   through an insecure communication channel. This paper shows in which
   conditions an AI agent can learn a secure encryption scheme. However, it
   also shows that, without a stronger adversary, it is more likely to
   obtain an insecure one.},

Abstract = {The present work suggested predicting models based on machine learning
   algorithms including the least square support vector machine (LSSVM),
   artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive network-based fuzzy

   based on several statistical analyses between the real and determined
   data points. Outcomes from the suggested models expressed their high
   abilities to determine relative humidity for various ranges of dry bulb
   temperatures and also wet-bulb depression. According to the determined
   values of MRE and MSE were 0.933 and 0.134, 2.39 and 1, 1.291 and 0.193,
   0.931 and 0.132 for the RBF-ANN, MLP-ANN, ANFIS, and LSSVM models,

Title = {Improving solar forecasting using Deep Learning and Portfolio Theory
   integration},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {195},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Solar energy has been consolidated as one of the main renewable energy
   sources capable of contributing to supply global energy demand. However,
   the solar resource has intermittent feature in electricity production,
   making it difficult to manage the electrical system. Hence, we propose
   the application of Deep Learning (DL), one of the emerging themes in the
   field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a solar predictor. To attest
   its capacity, the technique is compared with other consolidated solar
   forecasting strategies such as Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Base
   Function and Support Vector Regression. Additionally, integration of AI
   methods in a new adaptive topology based on the Portfolio Theory (PT) is
   proposed hereby to improve solar forecasts. PT takes advantage of
   diversified forecast assets: when one of the assets shows prediction
   errors, these are offset by another asset. After testing with data from
   Spain and Brazil, results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error
   (MAPE) for predictions using DL is 6.89\% and for the proposed
   integration (called PrevPT) is 5.36\% concerning data from Spain. For
   the data from Brazil, MAPE for predictions using DL is 6.08\% and 4.52\%
   for PrevPT. In both cases, DL and PrevPT results are better than the
   other techniques being used. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {AIMS BIOENGINEERING},

Volume = {9},

Pages = {266-282},
Abstract = {Currently, the gastric cancer is the source of the high mortality rate
   where it is diagnoses from the stomach and esophagus tests. To this end,
   the whole of studies in the analysis of cancer are built on AI
   (artificial intelligence) to develop the analysis accuracy and decrease
   the danger of death. Mostly, deep learning methods in images processing
   has made remarkable advancement. In this paper, we present a method for
   detection, recognition and segmentation of gastric cancer in endoscopic
   images. To this end, we propose a deep learning method named GAS-Net to
   detect and recognize gastric cancer from endoscopic images. Our method
   comprises at the beginning a preprocessing step for images to make all
   images in the same standard. After that, the GAS-Net method is based an
   entire architecture to form the network. A union between two loss
   functions is applied in order to adjust the pixel distribution of
   normal/abnormal areas. GAS-Net achieved excellent results in recognizing
   lesions on two datasets annotated by a team of expert from several
   disciplines (Dataset1, is a dataset of stomach cancer images of
   anonymous patients that was approved from a private medical-hospital
   clinic, Dataset2, is a publicly available and open dataset named
   HyperKvasir {[}1]). The final results were hopeful and proved the
   efficiency of the proposal. Moreover, the accuracy of classification in
   the test phase was 94.06\%. This proposal offers a specific mode to
   detect, recognize and classify gastric tumors.},

Title = {A hybrid intelligent model for acute hypotensive episode prediction with
   large-scale data},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {546},
Pages = {787-802},
Month = {FEB 6},
Abstract = {Acute hypotensive episode (AHE) is a common serious postoperative
   complication in ICU, which may raise multiple system failure (especially
   of cardiac and respiratory kinds), and even cause death. Timely and
   effective clinical intervention is obviously vital to the saving of
   patients. AHE detection involves physiological time-series monitoring,
   processing and prediction technologies, which can offer insights to
   neuroscientists, biologists, and even provide support for clinicians.
   This paper presents a hybrid artificial intelligence model combined with
   CEEMDAN (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive
   noise, a typical method for physiological signal decomposition), deep
   learning, multiple gene expression programming and fuzzy expert system
   for AHE detection. In this paper, the physiological signal is selected
   from a benchmark dataset, for example MIMIC-II (Multiparameter
   Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II), which collects large scale
   real patients' data for clinical research. In the hybrid model, a
   typical signal decomposition method is employed for AHE signal
   processing, and an autoencoder based deep neural network is established
   for feature extraction. Finally, a reliable and explainable classifier
   is presented by fusing gene expression programming and the fuzzy method.
   Experimental results based on real data set demonstrate that the
   proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art AHE detection methods by
   achieving the prediction accuracy of 88.14\% in 2866 records. (c) 2020

Title = {Academic literacy among the university students in Mexico and Spain: A
   holistic perspective},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {IntroductionCurrently, young people have access to a large amount of
   information, so they must have the ability to critically analyze the
   texts they are exposed to in order to choose those that are useful for
   their training or research process, as well as to have the necessary
   skills to interact efficiently with the texts, especially with those
   specialized documents corresponding to their area of study. In this
   regard, this article aims to identify how cognitive, emotional,
   attitudinal, digital and personality aspects influence the development
   of academic literacy skills in university students. MethodResearch was
   conducted with the mixed method, in which quantitative instruments were
   applied and analyzed: a Likert scale questionnaire to measure the
   perceived level of mastery of academic literacy skills, which was
   applied to a sample of 595 students from higher education institutions
   in Mexico and Spain. In addition, a test was applied to identify
   personality type. For the qualitative part, the case study was chosen
   and the qualitative instruments applied were interviews with a teacher
   and a student and a focus group with five students. ResultsThe findings
   identified were as follows: (a) the cognitive aspect of academic
   literacy is the one with the lowest perceived mastery by students, (b)
   having a positive attitude favors the development of academic literacy,
   (c) by knowing the aspects of their personality that can favor the
   development of academic literacy, students can seek strategies to
   improve that competency, (d) the emotional part has repercussions in the
   process of developing the competence of academic literacy, (e) students
   prefer to interact with texts in digital spaces and therefore must learn
   to interact critically in virtual environments, (f) Mexican students
   perceive themselves to have a higher level of mastery of the academic
   literacy competency than Spanish students. ConclusionThe literature
   review and the mixed methods study allowed identifying the relevance of
   approaching academic literacy in university environments in a holistic
   manner through the analysis of the influence of cognitive, attitudinal,
   emotional, digital and personality aspects.},

Title = {College English Reading Teaching Integrating Production Oriented
   Approach from the Perspective of Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {The objectives are to solve many problems in traditional English reading
   teaching, such as the passive acceptance of students' learning
   situation, the rigid teaching mode of teachers and the difficulty in
   taking into account the individual needs of each student, and the forced
   averaging of students' English learning ability and level. Firstly, a
   detection method of English reading level based on the Backpropagation
   neural network (BPNN) is designed. Secondly, the teaching process and
   specific teaching plan are designed with the Production Oriented
   Approach (POA). Finally, the detection method of English reading level
   is verified by simulation experiments, and the effect of the teaching
   method integrating POA is analyzed. The results show that (1) when the
   learning rate is 0.26 and the training time is 1000 times, the mean
   square error (MSE) of the model is the smallest. (2) The results of the
   practical experiment indicate that the number of people who sign up for
   the college English proficiency test, the number of actual exams, and
   the pass rate of the test in the experimental group using the teaching
   method are higher than those in the control group. Moreover, the number
   of people in the experimental group increased more than that in the
   control group after the experiment. There is no significant difference
   in the test results of the two groups before the experiment, and the
   average test scores of the experimental group are obviously higher than
   those of the control group after the experiment. The p value of the two
   groups of results is less than 0.05 in the t-test, indicating that there
   is a significant difference in the English reading level between the two
   groups after the experiment. Simultaneously, the difference between the
   results of class A before and after the experiment is larger than that
   of class B, showing that the teaching method integrating POA is more
   effective for students with higher English levels. Therefore, compared
   with the traditional teaching method, the teaching mode integrating POA
   is more effective in improving the English reading level of college
   students. It aims to transform POA theory into practice and provide a
   great reference for college English reading teaching.},

Abstract = {Involving students in scientific modeling practice is one of the most
   effective approaches to achieving the next generation science education
   learning goals. Given the complexity and multirepresentational features
   of scientific models, scoring student-developed models is time- and
   cost-intensive, remaining one of the most challenging assessment
   practices for science education. More importantly, teachers who rely on
   timely feedback to plan and adjust instruction are reluctant to use
   modeling tasks because they could not provide timely feedback to
   learners. This study utilized machine learning (ML), the most advanced
   artificial intelligence (AI), to develop an approach to automatically
   score student-drawn models and their written descriptions of those
   models. We developed six modeling assessment tasks for middle school
   students that integrate disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting
   concepts with the modeling practice. For each task, we asked students to
   draw a model and write a description of that model, which gave students
   with diverse backgrounds an opportunity to represent their understanding
   in multiple ways. We then collected student responses to the six tasks
   and had human experts score a subset of those responses. We used the
   human-scored student responses to develop ML algorithmic models (AMs)
   and to train the computer. Validation using new data suggests that the
   machine-assigned scores achieved robust agreements with human consent
   scores. Qualitative analysis of student-drawn models further revealed
   five characteristics that might impact machine scoring accuracy:
   Alternative expression, confusing label, inconsistent size, inconsistent
   position, and redundant information. We argue that these five
   characteristics should be considered when developing machine-scorable
   modeling tasks.},

Abstract = {Advances in machine learning in medical imaging are occurring at a rapid
   pace in research laboratories both at academic institutions and in
   industry. Important artificial intelligence (AI) tools for diagnostic
   imaging include algorithms for disease detection and classification,
   image optimization, radiation reduction, and workflow enhancement.
   Although advances in foundational research are occurring rapidly,
   translation to routine clinical practice has been slower. In August
   2018, the National Institutes of Health assembled multiple relevant
   stakeholders at a public meeting to discuss the current state of
   knowledge, infrastructure gaps, and challenges to wider implementation.
   The conclusions of that meeting are summarized in two publications that
   identify and prioritize initiatives to accelerate foundational and
   translational research in AI for medical imaging. This publication
   summarizes key priorities for translational research developed at the
   workshop including: (1) creating structured AI use cases, defining and
   highlighting clinical challenges potentially solvable by AI; (2)
   establishing methods to encourage data sharing for training and testing
   AI algorithms to promote generalizability to widespread clinical
   practice and mitigate unintended bias; (3) establishing tools for
   validation and performance monitoring of AI algorithms to facilitate
   regulatory approval; and (4) developing standards and common data
   elements for seamless integration of AI tools into existing clinical
   workflows. An important goal of the resulting road map is to grow an
   ecosystem, facilitated by professional societies, industry, and
   government agencies, that will allow robust collaborations between
   practicing clinicians and AI researchers to advance foundational and
   translational research relevant to medical imaging. (C) 2019 Published

Title = {Research on the Construction of the Quality Evaluation Model System for
   the Teaching Reform of Physical Education Students in Colleges and
   Universities under the Background of Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {With the continuous progress of the times, the reform of physical
   education teaching in colleges and universities has to be promoted day
   by day. The most important task in the process of reform is how to
   improve the quality of physical education teaching. Only by reforming
   colleges and universities can we transport outstanding talents into the
   society. It is very important to improve the teaching quality by
   improving the physical education quality evaluation system. As
   artificial intelligence technology has been more and more widely used in
   different fields, various educational administration systems based on
   information management have been established in various colleges and
   universities. On the one hand, it has brought great convenience to the
   management of physical education in colleges and universities and
   improvement of the efficiency of sports education management, but on the
   other hand, there are many shortcomings in the process of practical
   application. For example, the application of the database does not fully
   reflect its function and convenience, and it is only used at the level
   of query and statistics. Therefore, a better evaluation system of
   physical education teaching quality has become the common expectation of
   all colleges and universities. This paper makes a powerful analysis of
   the current quality evaluation of physical education in colleges and
   universities and proposes a method of establishing a basic framework
   through expert systems, filling in details with the idea of knowledge
   base and fuzzy sets, and further using a three-layer B/S framework model
   to design universal teaching quality assessment system. When discussing
   the requirements, functional framework, and actual development of the
   teaching evaluation system, the characteristics of the traditional
   physical education evaluation model are deeply analyzed, and the
   system's interactivity, flexibility, accuracy, and fairness are
   emphasized in the implementation process. Object-oriented design and
   analysis are carried out on the requirements of the system, and finally,
   black-box testing is carried out to ensure the reliability and
   correctness of the system logic.},

   works as a fuzzy logic based web service. The aim is that it will make
   it easier for an individual to choose the right profession. In this
   system, students' prior educational successes and teachers' views were
   integrated in a manner which made it possible to identify the students'
   professional interests and capacities. The system forecasts vocational
   school students' interest with regard to Information Technology,
   Electrics-Electronics, Accounting, and Automotive. Promising results
   were obtained with regard to 300 unbiased 9th grade students in terms of
   orienting them towards an appropriate profession.},

Title = {Blessing of dimensionality at the edge and geometry of few-shot learning},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {564},
Pages = {124-143},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In this paper we present theory and algorithms enabling classes of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to continuously and incrementally
   improve with a priori quantifiable guarantees-or more specifically
   remove classification errors-over time. This is distinct from
   state-of-the-art machine learning, AI, and software approaches. The
   theory enables building few-shot AI correction algorithms and provides
   conditions justifying their successful application. Another feature of
   this approach is that, in the supervised setting, the computational
   complexity of training is linear in the number of training samples. At
   the time of classification, the computational complexity is bounded by
   few inner product calculations. Moreover, the implementation is shown to
   be very scalable. This makes it viable for deployment in applications
   where computational power and memory are limited, such as embedded
   environments. It enables the possibility for fast on-line optimisation
   using improved training samples. The approach is based on the
   concentration of measure effects and stochastic separation theorems and
   is illustrated with an example on the identification faulty processes in
   Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling and with a case study on
   adaptive removal of false positives in an industrial video surveillance
   and analytics system.

Title = {Prediction of Driver Gene Matching in Lung Cancer NOG/PDX Models Based

Journal = {ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful tool for drug
   discovery and screening in cancer. However, current studies have led to
   little understanding of genotype mismatches in PDXs, leading to massive
   economic losses. Here, we established PDX models from 53 lung cancer
   patients with a genotype matching rate of 79.2\% (42/53). Furthermore,
   17 clinicopathological features were examined and input in stepwise
   logistic regression (LR) models based on the lowest Akaike information
   criterion (AIC), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
   (LASSO)-LR, support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination
   (SVM-RFE), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting and
   categorical features (CatBoost), and the synthetic minority oversampling
   technique (SMOTE). Finally, the performance of all models was evaluated
   by the accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUC), and F1 score in 100 testing groups. Two multivariable LR models
   revealed that age, number of driver gene mutations, epidermal growth
   factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, type of prior chemotherapy, prior
   tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, and the source of the sample
   were powerful predictors. Moreover, CatBoost (mean accuracy = 0.960;
   mean AUC = 0.939; mean F1 score = 0.908) and the eight-feature SVM-RFE
   (mean accuracy = 0.950; mean AUC = 0.934; mean F1 score = 0.903) showed
   the best performance among the algorithms. Meanwhile, application of the
   SMOTE improved the predic-tive capability of most models, except
   CatBoost. Based on the SMOTE, the ensemble classifier of single models
   achieved the highest accuracy (mean = 0.975), AUC (mean = 0.949), and F1
   score (mean = 0.938). In conclusion, we established an optimal
   predictive model to screen lung cancer patients for non-obese diabetic
   (NOD)/Shi-scid, interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) cnull (NOG)/PDX models
   and offer a general approach for building predictive models.(c) 2021 THE

Abstract = {Weeds are unwanted plants that can reduce crop yields by competing for
   water, nutrients, light, space, and carbon dioxide, which need to be
   controlled to meet future food production requirements. The integration
   of drones, artificial intelligence, and various sensors, which include
   hyperspectral, multi-spectral, and RGB (red-green-blue), ensure the
   possibility of a better outcome in managing weed problems. Most of the
   major or minor challenges caused by weed infestation can be faced by
   implementing remote sensing systems in various agricultural tasks. It is
   a multi-disciplinary science that includes spectroscopy, optics,
   computer, photography, satellite launching, electronics, communication,
   and several other fields. Future challenges, including food security,
   sustainability, supply and demand, climate change, and herbicide
   resistance, can also be overcome by those technologies based on machine
   learning approaches. This review provides an overview of the potential
   and practical use of unmanned aerial vehicle and remote sensing
   techniques in weed management practices and discusses how they overcome
   future challenges.},

Abstract = {The Kirsten rat sarcoma viral G12C (KRAS(G12C)) protein is one of the
   most common mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS(G12C)
   inhibitors are promising for NSCLC treatment, but their weaker activity
   in resistant tumors is their drawback. This study aims to identify new
   KRAS(G12C) inhibitors from among the FDA-approved covalent drugs by
   taking advantage of artificial intelligence. The machine learning models
   were constructed using an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm.
   The models can predict KRAS(G12C) inhibitors well, with an accuracy
   score of validation = 0.85 and Q(Ext)(2) = 0.76. From 67 FDA-covalent
   drugs, afatinib, dacomitinib, acalabrutinib, neratinib, zanubrutinib,
   dutasteride, and finasteride were predicted to be active inhibitors.
   Afatinib obtained the highest predictive log-inhibitory concentration at
   50\% (pIC(50)) value against KRAS(G12C) protein close to the KRAS(G12C)
   inhibitors. Only afatinib, neratinib, and zanubrutinib covalently bond
   at the active site like the KRAS(G12C) inhibitors in the KRAS(G12C)
   protein (PDB ID: 6OIM). Moreover, afatinib, neratinib, and zanubrutinib
   exhibited a distance deviation between the KRAS(G2C) protein-ligand
   complex similar to the KRAS(G12C) inhibitors. Therefore, afatinib,
   neratinib, and zanubrutinib could be used as drug candidates against the
   KRAS(G12C) protein. This finding unfolds the benefit of artificial
   intelligence in drug repurposing against KRAS(G12C) protein.},

Abstract = {Digital change is like a fast-moving tsunami, with the digitalization of
   many business practices creating new relationships between businesses
   and customers and altering the marketing landscape. We provide an
   overview of several of these emerging digital innovations and their
   evolving impact on marketing activities. It is imperative that college
   students gain exposure to such cutting-edge technologies and ingrain the
   conceptual, inquiry, critical thinking, creativity, and integrative
   learning skills needed to add value in a world where machines will work
   alongside human professionals. We suggest that by embracing rather than
   banning technology, faculty enfranchise students through increased
   sensory experiences and enhanced digital activities, which will lead to
   greater learning. We contend that vested stakeholders-institutions of
   higher education, professional associations, publishing companies, and
   technology companies-need to support and strengthen faculty efforts in
   embracing technology to continuously enhance learning.},

Abstract = {Review strategies after learning new knowledge are essential for
   students to consolidate the key points, understand the subject content,
   analyze aspects of the learning topics, and summarize the knowledge
   content of learning while mastering new knowledge. However, educators
   have found that students generally have difficulties seeking help when
   they encounter learning problems. This could significantly affect their
   after-class review performances. To cope with this problem, an
   after-class review approach with an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based
   chatbot is proposed in this study to provide students with immediate and
   quality feedback during the learning process. Moreover, a
   quasi-experiment was conducted to explore students' learning motivation,
   attitude, and academic performance when using the AI-based chatbot.
   Participants were two classes of students from a university in Taiwan.
   One class with 18 students was the experimental group and the other with
   20 students was the control group. The experimental group used the
   AI-based chatbot in the after-class review, while the control group used
   the conventional after-class review approach. Research results showed
   that the application of AI-based chatbots in the review process of
   public health courses could improve students' academic performance,
   self-efficacy, learning attitude, and motivation. In other words,
   chatbots could help students become more active in the learning process.
   It is noted that after students asked questions, providing them with
   sufficient feedback during the review process could make them feel
   recognized and help to establish a relaxing and friendly interaction,
   thereby improving their academic performance.},

Abstract = {Future Internet is expected to meet explosive traffic growth and
   extremely complex architecture, which tend to make the traditional NTC
   strategies inefficient and even ineffective. Inspired by the latest
   breakthroughs of AI and its power to address large-scale and complex
   difficulties, the network community has begun to consider shifting the
   NTC paradigm from legacy rule-based to novel AI-based. As an applied
   inter-discipline, design and implementation are important. Although
   there have been some preliminary explorations along this frontier, they
   are either limited by only envisioning the prospects, or too scattered
   to provide high-level insight into a general methodology. To this end,
   we start with the domain knowledge relationships of AI and NTC,
   summarizing a baseline workflow toward deep reinforcement learning,
   which will be the dominant method for the AI-NTC paradigm. On top of
   that, we argue that AI-NTC training and running must be carried out in
   online environments in closed-loop fashion for the purpose of putting ti
   into practice. A series of challenges and opportunities are discussed
   from a realistic viewpoint, and a set of new architecture and mechanism
   to enable the online and closed-loop AI-NTC paradigm are proposed.
   Hopefully, this work can help the AI community to better understand NTC
   and the NTC community to better live with AI.},

Abstract = {Historically, the term ``artificial intelligence{''} dates to 1956 when
   it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since
   then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped
   by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain,
   scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of
   performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into
   artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the
   human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms
   has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI)
   algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still
   markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly
   because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it
   has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal
   utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context,
   there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI).
   Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and
   addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand
   deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically
   developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best
   understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug
   discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from
   AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert
   review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to
   traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not
   only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that
   are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include
   digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of
   health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt
   diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with
   consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for
   integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to
   replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such
   expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible
   innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from
   prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of
   automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on
   scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.},

Title = {Quantification of river total phosphorus using integrative artificial
   intelligence models},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Total phosphorus (T-P) refers to the concentration of phosphorus in
   water and is one of the important parameters for eutrophication in lakes
   and rivers. In current research, neuroscience dependent (i.e., singular
   and doubleplatform synthetic) approaches were employed to predict the
   river T-P concentration. Singular techniques were developed utilizing
   machine learning based (support vector machines (SVMs), stochastic
   gradient boosting (SGB)), and deep learning based multilayer perceptron
   (DMLP) models. Besides, double-platform synthetic techniques were
   developed by integrating a prior data-processing (Discrete-wavelet)
   algorithm with the singular techniques. Six input scenarios conditional
   on different water quantity and quality parameters acquired from two
   stations (Hwangji and Toilchun), South Korea, were employed for
   appraising singular and double-platform synthetic techniques. The
   various promoted models were evaluated using four statistical standards
   viz., mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), scatter
   index (SI), and Pearson correlation coefficient (CCp), and four visual
   references viz., scatter diagram, box-and-whisker plot, violin plot, and
   Taylor diagram. It can be indicated from the outcomes that the
   double-platform synthetic techniques did not always lead to more
   accurate predictions than the singular techniques. Further, results also
   supplied that the SGB with the 6th input (MAE = 0.012 mg/L, RMSE = 0.014
   mg/L, and CCp = 0.650 for Hwangji; MAE = 0.011 mg/L, RMSE = 0.017 mg/L,
   and CCp = 0.963 for Toilchun) scenario model demonstrated the best
   accuracy for predicting river T-P concentration by the singular
   techniques for both stations, whereas the discrete-wavelet SVMs with the
   4th input (MAE = 0.007 mg/L, RMSE = 0.011 mg/L, and CCp = 0.765 for
   Hwangji) and discrete-wavelet SGB with the 5th input (MAE = 0.012 mg/L,
   RMSE = 0.017 mg/L, and CCp = 0.953 for Toilchun) scenario models
   provided the best predictive accuracy among double-platform synthetic
   techniques, respectively.},

Abstract = {In recent years, many new technologies, such as the Internet, cloud
   computing, and the 5th-generation (5G) mobile network, have been widely
   applied in colleges. The structure and functions of traditional media
   technology can no longer satisfy the demand for media resource
   management (MRM) in colleges. Therefore, this paper creates an
   intelligent MRM system based on cloud service, providing a brand-new
   intelligent MRM solution. Through cloud service and artificial
   intelligence (AI), the proposed system relies on intelligent algorithms
   to realize automatic, comprehensive, and quick identification, review,
   tagging, storage and query of videos and images in media resources. The
   research findings can effectively improve the quality of college

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of human life and has
   even forced humans to shift their life habits, including in the world of
   education. The learning model must shift from the traditional
   face-to-face pattern to a modern face-to-face pattern or an asynchronous
   pattern with information technology-based applications. Blended learning
   is one of the appropriate solutions to adjust the limited face-to-face
   learning conditions. Blended learning can be done, for example, by
   scheduling learning by dividing the number of participants by 50\% and
   entering on a scheduled basis. However, the problem is that the time and
   effort used are less efficient. Blended learning can also be done by
   conducting learning simultaneously with 50\% of students in class and
   the remaining 50\% through conferences. This concept will streamline the
   time and effort used. However, the problem is that there is a gap in the
   learning experience between students in class and students who do
   learning via conference. This innovative blended learning system
   framework is proposed to overcome these problems. The system built seeks
   to present an online learning experience atmosphere so that it is
   expected to be able to resemble an offline learning atmosphere. We
   created a system using camera technology and object detection that will
   track the movement of the teacher so that the teacher can move freely in
   the room without having to be stuck in front of the computer holding the
   conference. The algorithms used are MobileNet Single Shot Detector and
   Centroid Tracking. This research produces an accurate model for
   detecting teacher movement at a distance of 2, 4, and 6 meters with a
   camera installation height of 1.5 and 3 meters.},

Abstract = {With the arrival of graduation season, the number of graduates is
   expanding every year, and the employment rate of college students has
   become one of the data that colleges and universities pay attention to.
   To improve the employment rate of college students, we should first
   educate each college student in career planning, so that they can
   clearly understand their own positioning and future development
   direction. Career planning can guide students to understand their jobs
   and analyze their professional fields. Faced with massive employment
   information, it is also a big problem for college students to search and
   choose information. In this paper, the personalized recommendation
   system for entrepreneurship is described, and the basic principles of
   information recommendation are described. The basic information and
   personal interest points of college students are represented by feature
   vectors, which provide a favorable theoretical support for college
   students' career planning and employment and entrepreneurship
   information recommendation. An information recommendation model under
   deep learning is formed. Finally, the performance of the model under the
   traditional algorithm and the optimized information recommendation model
   is evaluated, and the satisfaction of users to this system is scored so
   as to provide a convenient and quick information recommendation system
   for college students, thus indirectly improving the employment rate of
   graduates and providing corresponding solutions to the problem of
   difficult employment.},

Abstract = {Discovering oral cavity cancer (OCC) at an early stage is an effective
   way to increase patient survival rate. However, current initial
   screening process is done manually and is expensive for the average
   individual, especially in developing countries worldwide. This problem
   is further compounded due to the lack of specialists in such areas.
   Automating the initial screening process using artificial intelligence
   (AI) to detect pre-cancerous lesions can prove to be an effective and
   inexpensive technique that would allow patients to be triaged
   accordingly to receive appropriate clinical management. In this study,
   we have applied and evaluated the efficacy of six deep convolutional
   neural network (DCNN) models using transfer learning, for identifying
   pre-cancerous tongue lesions directly using a small dataset of
   clinically annotated photographic images to diagnose early signs of OCC.
   DCNN models were able to differentiate between benign and pre-cancerous
   tongue lesions and were also able to distinguish between five types of
   tongue lesions, i.e. hairy tongue, fissured tongue, geographic tongue,
   strawberry tongue and oral hairy leukoplakia with high classification
   performances. Preliminary results using an (AI + Physician) ensemble
   model demonstrate that an automated pre-screening process of oral tongue
   lesions using DCNNs can achieve `near-human' level classification
   performance for diagnosing early signs of OCC in patients.},

Abstract = {Since Klaus Schwab's (2016) phenomenal book, The Fourth Industrial
   Revolution, commonly depicted as 41R, the concept has significantly
   altered the multiple ways universities in (South) Africa look at or aim
   to address their institutional practices, most notably, teaching and
   learning encounters. Schwab's (2016, 7) reference to a ``new
   technology{''} revolution that would transform the way humans interact
   in the world today is inspired by ``emerging technology breakthroughs,
   covering wide-ranging fields such as artificial intelligence (AI),
   robotics, the internet of things (loT), autonomous vehicles, 3D
   printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy
   storage and quantum computing{''}. In this leading article, we offer an
   argument in defence of prioritising what we refer to as the cosmopolitan
   human condition if any meaningful sense were to be made of what Schwab
   (2016, 7) refers to as the amplification of ``fusion of technologies
   across the physical, digital and biological worlds{''}. In reference to
   our understandings of university teaching and learning, we give an
   account of how such encounters ought to be looked at in light of the new
   fusion of technology idea - that is, 41R.},

Abstract = {-The ranking of seed lots is a fundamental process for all companies in
   the seed industry. This work aims to demonstrate data mining methods for
   ranking sorghum seed lots during the seed processing through analysis of
   quality control data. Germination and cold tests were performed to
   verify the physiological quality of the lots. Seed samples from each lot
   were evaluated in two moments: post-cleaning and finished product (ready
   for marketing). The results after pre-processing totaled 188 rows of
   data with six attributes, encompassing 150 lots accepted for marketing,
   6 rejected, and 32 intermediate lots. The classifiers used were J48,
   Random Forest, Classification Via Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer
   Perceptron, and IBk. The Resample filter was used for adjustment of the
   data. The k-fold technique was used for training, with ten folds. The
   metrics of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure, and ROC Area were
   used to verify the accuracy of the algorithms. The results obtained were
   used to determine the best machine-learning algorithm. IBk and J48
   presented the highest accuracy of data; the IBk technique presented the
   best results. The Resample filter was essential for solving the data
   imbalance problem. Sorghum seed lots can be classified with great
   accuracy and precision through artificial intelligence and machine
   learning technique.},

Title = {Development of a light-weight deep learning model for cloud applications
   and remote diagnosis of skin cancers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Skin cancer is among the 10 most common cancers. Recent research
   revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence (AI) over
   dermatologists to diagnose skin cancer from predesignated and cropped
   images. However, there remain several uncertainties for AI in diagnosing
   skin cancers, including lack of testing for consistency, lack of
   pathological proof or ambiguous comparisons. Hence, to develop a
   reliable, feasible and user-friendly platform to facilitate the
   automatic diagnostic algorithm is important. The aim of this study was
   to build a light-weight skin cancer classification model based on deep
   learning methods for aiding first-line medical care. The developed model
   can be deployed on cloud platforms as well as mobile devices for remote
   diagnostic applications. We reviewed the medical records and clinical
   images of patients who received a histological diagnosis of basal cell
   carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, seborrheic keratosis and
   melanocytic nevus in 2006-2017 in the Department of Dermatology in
   Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH). We used the deep
   learning models to identify skin cancers and benign skin tumors in the
   manner of binary classification and multi-class classification in the
   KCGMH and HAM10000 datasets to construct a skin cancer classification
   model. The accuracy reached 89.5\% for the binary classifications
   (benign vs malignant) in the KCGMH dataset; the accuracy was 85.8\% in
   the HAM10000 dataset in seven-class classification and 72.1\% in the
   KCGMH dataset in five-class classification. Our results demonstrate that
   our skin cancer classification model based on deep learning methods is a
   highly promising aid for the clinical diagnosis and early identification
   of skin cancers and benign tumors.},

Title = {Risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety disorders in college

Abstract = {The worldwide prevalence of anxiety disorders among college students is
   high, which negatively affects countries, schools, families, and
   individual students to varying degrees. This paper reviews the relevant
   literature regarding risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety
   disorders among college students from the perspectives of different
   stakeholders. Risk factors at the national and societal levels include
   class differences and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
   College-level risk factors include the indoor environment design of the
   college environment, peer relationships, student satisfaction with
   college culture, and school functional levels. Family-level risk factors
   include parenting style, family relationship, and parental level of
   education. Individual-level risk factors include biological factors,
   lifestyle, and personality. Among the intervention options for college
   students' anxiety disorders, in addition to traditional cognitive
   behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, psychological
   counseling, and group counseling, digital mental health interventions
   are increasingly popular due to their low cost, positive effect, and
   convenient diagnostics and treatment. To better apply digital
   intervention to the prevention and treatment of college students'
   anxiety, this paper suggests that the different stakeholders form a
   synergy among themselves. The nation and society should provide
   necessary policy guarantees, financial support, and moral and ethical
   supervision for the prevention and treatment of college students'
   anxiety disorders. Colleges should actively participate in the screening
   and intervention of college students' anxiety disorders. Families should
   increase their awareness of college students' anxiety disorders and take
   the initiative to study and understand various digital intervention
   methods. College students with anxiety disorders should actively seek
   psychological assistance and actively accept and participate in digital
   intervention projects and services. We believe that in the future, the
   application of methods such as big data and artificial intelligence to
   improve digital interventions and provide individualized treatment plans
   will become the primary means of preventing and treating anxiety
   disorders among college students.},

Abstract = {Quantifying galaxy morphology is a challenging yet scientifically
   rewarding task. As the scale of data continues to increase with upcoming
   surveys, traditional classification methods will struggle to handle the
   load. We present a solution through an integration of visual and
   automated classifications, preserving the best features of both human
   and machine. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such a system through a
   re-analysis of visual galaxy morphology classifications collected during
   the Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) project. We reprocess the top-level question of
   the GZ2 decision tree with a Bayesian classification aggregation
   algorithm dubbed SWAP, originally developed for the Space Warps
   gravitational lens project. Through a simple binary classification
   scheme, we increase the classification rate nearly 5-fold classifying
   226 124 galaxies in 92 d of GZ2 project time while reproducing labels
   derived from GZ2 classification data with 95.7 per cent accuracy. We
   next combine this with a Random Forest machine learning algorithm that
   learns on a suite of non-parametric morphology indicators widely used
   for automated morphologies. We develop a decision engine that delegates
   tasks between human and machine and demonstrate that the combined system
   provides at least a factor of 8 increase in the classification rate,
   classifying 210 803 galaxies in just 32 d of GZ2 project time with 93.1
   per cent accuracy. As the Random Forest algorithm requires a minimal
   amount of computational cost, this result has important implications for
   galaxy morphology identification tasks in the era of Euclid and other
   large-scale surveys.},

Title = {Exploring Factors of the Willingness to Accept AI-Assisted Learning
   Environments: An Empirical Investigation Based on the UTAUT Model and
   Perceived Risk Theory},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely applied in many
   fields. AI-assisted learning environments have been implemented in
   classrooms to facilitate the innovation of pedagogical models. However,
   college students' willingness to accept (WTA) AI-assisted learning
   environments has been ignored. Exploring the factors that influence
   college students' willingness to use AI can promote AI technology
   application in higher education. Based on the Unified Theory of
   Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the theory of perceived
   risk, this study identified six factors that influence students'
   willingness to use AI to analyze their relationships with WTA
   AI-assisted learning environments. A model including six hypotheses was
   constructed to test the factors affecting students' WTA. The results
   indicated that college students showed ``weak rejection{''} of the
   construction of AI-assisted learning environments. Effort expectancy
   (EE), performance expectancy (PE), and social influence (SI) were all
   positively related to college students' WTA AI-assisted learning
   environments. Psychological risk (PR) significantly negatively
   influenced students' WTA. The findings of this study will be helpful for
   carrying out risk communication, which can promote the construction of
   AI-assisted learning environments.},

Abstract = {Predictive maintenance (PM) strategies are based on real-time data for
   diagnosis of impending failure and prognosis of machine health. It is a
   proactive process, which needs predictive modeling to trigger an alarm
   for maintenance activities and anticipate a failure before it occurs.
   Various industries have adopted PM techniques because of its advantage
   in increasing reliability and safety. But in the aviation industry,
   expectations for safety are increased due to its high cost and danger to
   human life when an aircraft fails or becomes out of service. Flight data
   monitoring systems are regularly implemented in commercial operations
   using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, but there is limited work
   specific to safety critical systems such as engine and hydraulic system.
   This paper provides a survey of recent work on PM of aircraft's'
   hydraulic system and engine, identifying new trends and challenges. This
   work also highlights the importance of PM and state-of-the-art data
   pre-processing techniques for large datasets.},

Title = {Are quiz-games an effective revision tool in Anatomical Sciences for
   Higher Education and what do students think of them?},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Recently, there has been an increased volume of pedagogical research and
   practice of mobile learning (m-learning) and gameplay in education. This
   paper presents the findings of a study that examined the effect on
   achievement and explored student perception towards quiz-game play prior
   to an anatomy assessment in first year Higher Education students.
   Achievement data was collected over two academic years at all module
   assessment (A1-A4) points. A1 was used as a baseline, showing no
   difference between groups or years, A2 and A3 were comparable online
   assessments done on the lower and upper limbs that followed the same
   format; A4 was a viva-voce to assess the whole module learning. The
   optional 15-minute quiz-gameplay intervention (G) using a mobile
   application was initiated prior to A3, those students who chose not to
   participate performed their traditional study routine; no other changes
   to assessments were made resulting in a Gameplay and non-gameplay (G,
   NG) group for each year. Students were invited to participate in an
   online focus group (N = 84) and a sample undertook in-depth interviews
   (N = 9) to gain qualitative data on their perceptions of the
   intervention. Students who participated in the gameplay (G) group (N =
   87) demonstrated a significant improvement in A3 compared to A2, and the
   non-game play (NG) group (N = 164) a significant decrease. A thematic
   analysis was undertaken on the focus group and interview data revealing
   key aspects of quiz-gameplay as a learning tool. This paper offers
   insight into the potential benefit of encouraging m-learning gameplay as
   part of revision or learning for anatomy students. This information
   could help educators and study support facilitate efficient revision
   methods as well as initiate further research into the use of anatomy
   gameplay to enhance the student learning experience.
   Practitioner Notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Repeated and formative quizzing can help memory or knowledge retention.
   Gameplay can help student engagement, learning and flow depending on the
   game in question.
   What this paper adds
   Using mobile app-based quiz-games prior to an anatomy assessment can
   improve student achievement.
   Students tend to play mobile app-based quiz-games whilst commuting on
   public transport, in their free time at home and at university.
   Elements of mobile app-based quiz-games students identified as important
   are that they are interactive, allow competition, are visually
   appealing, provide instant feedback, are user friendly and are
   facilitated by the teacher.
   Implications for practice
   Educators should encourage mobile app-based quiz-games to increase
   short-term learning or revision.
   Educators should facilitate mobile learning quiz-game opportunities to
   encourage learning outside of the classroom.
   Educators wanting to integrate mobile app-based quiz-games in their
   classes should use the game attributes identified in this study.},

Abstract = {Deep learning (DL), an emerging area of investigation in the fields of
   machine learning and artificial intelligence, has markedly advanced over
   the past years. DL techniques are being applied to assist medical
   professionals and researchers in improving clinical diagnosis, disease
   prediction and drug discovery. It is expected that DL will help to
   provide actionable knowledge from a variety of `big data', including
   metabolomics data. In this review, we discuss the applicability of DL to
   metabolomics, while presenting and discussing several examples from
   recent research. We emphasize the use of DL in tackling bottlenecks in
   metabolomics data acquisition, processing, metabolite identification, as
   well as in metabolic phenotyping and biomarker discovery. Finally, we
   discuss how DL is used in genome-scale metabolic modelling and in
   interpretation of metabolomics data. The DL-based approaches discussed
   here may assist computational biologists with the integration,
   prediction and drawing of statistical inference about biological
   outcomes, based on metabolomics data.},

Title = {Teaching Strategies and Psychological Effects of Entrepreneurship
   Education for College Students Majoring in Social Security Law Based on
   Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {MAR 17},
Abstract = {This study aims to achieve the goal of cultivating and reserving
   emerging professional talents in social security law, improve the
   curriculum and mechanism of entrepreneurship education, and improve
   students' entrepreneurial willingness and entrepreneurial ability. Deep
   learning technology is used to study the psychological effects of
   entrepreneurship education for college students majoring in social
   security law. Firstly, the concept of entrepreneurial psychology is
   elaborated and summarized. A related model is designed using the theory
   of proactive personality and planned behavior through questionnaire
   survey and regression analysis to explore the relationship between
   students' entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial intention.
   Secondly, an entrepreneurship education method based on deep learning is
   proposed, and a teaching model of multi-dimensional collaborative
   entrepreneurship education practice is constructed. On this basis, the
   deep learning algorithm combines the characteristics of the personalized
   recommendation algorithm to construct an efficient Problem-Based
   Learning (PBL) learning resource recommendation algorithm. Finally, the
   proposed method is tested. The results show that the Significant (Sig.)
   value of students who have participated in PBL deep learning courses is
   less than 0.05, indicating that PBL significantly improves students'
   learning ability and the ability to deal with entrepreneurial
   environments. The results verify the impact of entrepreneurial learning
   on entrepreneurial intentions. The research on PBL online learning
   recommendation system shows that the proposed recommendation algorithm
   is superior to the traditional recommendation algorithm in both roots
   mean square error value and mean absolute error value on both datasets.
   The proposed method provides a new idea of reform and innovation to
   cultivate social security law professionals and the cultivation of the
   reserve model.},

Title = {Modeling Spatial Flood using Novel Ensemble Artificial Intelligence
   Approaches in Northern Iran},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The uncertainty of flash flood makes them highly difficult to predict
   through conventional models. The physical hydrologic models of flash
   flood prediction of any large area is very difficult to compute as it
   requires lot of data and time. Therefore remote sensing data based
   models (from statistical to machine learning) have become highly popular
   due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a
   continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models
   through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood
   modeling through novel hybrid machine learning models, which can improve
   the prediction accuracy. The hybrid machine learning ensemble approaches
   that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace,
   and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to
   evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of
   instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess
   flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent
   variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as
   independent variables were used to model the FS. Several
   threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to
   verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine
   learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC),
   efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics
   (TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency
   ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of
   the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to
   stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall
   played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method
   with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of
   0.89, sensitivity of 0.87, and TSS of 0.78, has become the most
   effective ensemble in predicting the FS. The FR technique also showed
   good performance and reliability for all models. Map removal sensitivity
   analysis (MRSA) revealed that the FS maps have the highest sensitivity
   to elevation. Based on the findings of the validation methods, the FS
   maps prepared using the machine learning ensemble techniques have high
   robustness and can be used to advise flood management initiatives in
   flood-prone areas.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it develops a prediction
   system to help the credit card issuer model the credit card delinquency
   risk. Second, it seeks to explore the potential of deep learning (also
   called a deep neural network), an emerging artificial intelligence
   technology, in the credit risk domain. With real-life credit card data
   linked to 711,397 credit card holders from a large bank in Brazil, this
   study develops a deep neural network to evaluate the risk of credit card
   delinquency based on the client's personal characteristics and the
   spending behaviours. Compared with machine-learning algorithms of
   logistic regression, naive Bayes, traditional artificial neural
   networks, and decision trees, deep neural networks have a better overall
   predictive performance with the highest F scores and area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve. The successful application of
   deep learning implies that artificial intelligence has great potential
   to support and automate credit risk assessment for financial
   institutions and credit bureaus.},

Title = {Establishment of smart education system in modern universities: concept,
   technologies and challenges},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {180-188},
Abstract = {The revolutionary digital transformations of society have led to the
   need for formulating a smart higher education system, adequate to modern
   conditions and based on the integrated use of intelligent digital
   solutions. The paper substantiates that the creations of such systems
   requires the solution of a whole complex of technological,
   institutional, organizational, economic and managerial issues. In
   accordance with this, the main tasks for the digital transformation of
   universities are studied, including: the formation of basic digital
   competencies, the incorporation of the digital agenda in research, the
   substantial modernization of bachelor's and master's programs, as well
   as programs of additional professional education. The paper identifies
   various levels of introducing ICT into everyday practice and creating
   the so-called ``smart education{''} system from the perspective of a
   process approach. The article reveals the possibilities of applying the
   paradigm of knowledge engineering for the intellectualisation of the
   higher education system. The article also shows how the methods,
   approaches and methodologies of knowledge engineering (KE) can be used
   for the development of intelligent learning systems and smart tutoring
   systems (STSs). It is proved that the convergence of artificial
   intelligence (AI), web science (WS) and data science (DS) allows for the
   creation of a new generation of web intelligent systems for all
   educational and training tasks. One of the main objectives of this study
   is to determine and explore the benefits and advantages of such
   computational paradigms to increase the effectiveness and enhance the
   efficiency of smart tutoring systems. The key advantages and challenges
   of the use of modern intelligent systems and technologies in
   universities are identified, taking into account the characteristics of
   specific ICTs.Decisions are determined at different levels of the
   economic hierarchy, the adoption of which is essential for the
   institutionalisation of smart higher education systems.It is established
   that the creation of a smart education system requires funding from
   government agencies and educational institutions themselves and their
   partners in the ICT sector, as well as stimulating the demand for
   relevant technological innovations in the educational sector.},

Title = {Physical layer security for beyond 5G/6G networks: Emerging technologies
   and future directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {206},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Physical layer security (PLS) has proven to be a potential solution for
   enhancing the security performance of future 5G networks, which promises
   to fulfill the demands of increasing user traffic. Preventing
   eavesdroppers from overhearing and stealing useful information in such
   high traffic environments is as challenging as eliminating them from the
   network. The goal of this survey is to present a comprehensive study of
   the latest PLS works proposed to enhance the security performance in
   different 5G technologies. The survey starts by first giving a detailed
   introduction and overview of existing surveys that explicitly or
   partially discuss PLS in 5G and its emerging technologies. Many
   researchers have presented a number of PLS schemes, using either a
   separate technology such as Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO),
   Millimeter Wave (mmWave), Radio frequency (RF), Non-orthogonal multiple
   access (NOMA), Visible light communication (VLC), etc., or a combination
   of two or more technologies, for securing each field of future 5G
   networks such as Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), Device-to-Device
   (D2D), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cognitive radio network (CRN), Unmanned
   Aerial Network (UAV), etc. After summarizing the existing surveys, we
   present a detailed overview on the PLS research works performed till now
   in HetNets, with respect to its different underlaying technologies, as
   well as in other emerging 5G technologies. Then, optimization ontology
   is presented that discusses different security metrics used for
   measuring PLS performance. Different from rest of the surveys, our
   survey includes a comprehensive discussion regarding the proposed PLS
   techniques based on artificial intelligence and machine learning
   techniques, especially highlighting the works performed using
   reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms, allowing us to
   understand how artificial intelligence can help to achieve better PLS.
   Towards the end, we discuss numerous challenges being encountered in
   practical implementation of PLS techniques, and propose different
   interesting areas that can be opted as future research direction.},

Title = {Predicting Patient Demographics From Chest Radiographs With Deep
   Learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1151-1161},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Deep learning models are increasingly informing medical
   decision making, for instance, in the detection of acute intracranial
   hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism. However, many models are trained on
   medical image databases that poorly represent the diversity of the
   patients they serve. In turn, many artificial intelligence models may
   not perform as well on assisting providers with important medical
   decisions for underrepresented populations.Purpose: Assessment of the
   ability of deep learning models to classify the self-reported gender,
   age, self-reported ethnicity, and in-surance status of an individual
   patient from a given chest radiograph.Methods: Models were trained and
   tested with 55,174 radiographs in the MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR)
   database. External validation data came from two separate databases, one
   from CheXpert and another from a multihospital urban health care system
   after institutional review board approval. Macro-averaged area under the
   curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate performance of models. Code
   used for this study is open-source and available at
   https://github.com/ai-bias/cxr-bias, and pixelstopatients.com/models/
   demographics.Results: Accuracy of models to predict gender was nearly
   perfect, with 0.999 (95\% confidence interval: 0.99-0.99) AUC on
   held-out test data and 0.994 (0.99-0.99) and 0.997 (0.99-0.99) on
   external validation data. There was high accuracy to predict age and
   ethnicity, ranging from 0.854 (0.80-0.91) to 0.911 (0.88-0.94) AUC, and
   moderate accuracy to predict insurance status, with AUC ranging from
   0.705 (0.60-0.81) on held-out test data to 0.675 (0.54-0.79) on external
   validation data.Conclusions: Deep learning models can predict the age,
   self-reported gender, self-reported ethnicity, and insurance status of a
   patient from a chest radiograph. Visualization techniques are useful to
   ensure deep learning models function as intended and to demonstrate
   anatomical regions of interest. These models can be used to ensure that
   training data are diverse, thereby ensuring artificial intelligence
   models that work on diverse populations.},

Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {The ability to detect cancer atan early stage in patients who would
   benefit from effective therapy is a key factor in increasing
   survivabil-ity. This work proposes an evolutionary supervised learning
   method called CancerSig to identify cancer stage-specific microRNA
   (miRNA) signatures for early cancer predictions. CancerSig established a
   compact panel of miRNA signatures as potential markers from 4,667
   patients with 15 different types of cancers for the cancer stage
   prediction, and achieved a mean performance: 10-fold cross-validation
   accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve of 84.27\% +/- 6.31\%, 0.81 +/- 0.12,
   0.80 +/- 0.10, and 0.80 +/- 0.06, respectively. The pan-cancer analysis
   of miRNA signatures suggested that three miRNAs, hsa-let-7i-3p,
   hsa-miR-362-3p, and hsa-miR-3651, contributed significantly toward stage
   prediction across 8 cancers, and each of the 67 miRNAs of the panel was
   a biomarker of stage prediction in more than one cancer. CancerSig may
   serve as the basis for cancer screening and therapeutic selection..},

Abstract = {Motivation is one of the most important factors (along with teaching.
   Becoming a successful teacher of art disciplines is closely related
   awareness in this state. The pedagogical profession requires from the
   teacher the formed need for artistic and educational activity, awareness
   of its importance for the spiritual development of society; high level
   of ideological, humanitarian and aesthetic culture; developed
   professional and pedagogical abilities, deep professional knowledge and
   skills, experience of artistic and creative pedagogical activity. The
   artistic needs of students arise and develop in the process of
   music-educational activities, which should be based on their positive
   emotional attitude to it. It is proved that in the process of
   educational activity a system of mental actions of reproductive and
   productive nature is formed, which is self-regulated and self-organized
   by the individual. Any activity, and in this case educational, is
   affected by certain incentives that become the driving force of student
   activity. Such incentives are needs, interests, beliefs, values, ideals,
   forming the motivation to learn. Along with the abilities, knowledge,
   and skills that ensure the success of teaching, motivation also includes
   emotional and value attitudes, sustained interest and inclination of the
   future teacher to pedagogical work; the need for active influence on the
   moral and emotional, intellectual and volitional spheres of the

Title = {High-Dimensional Brain in a High-Dimensional World: Blessing of
   Dimensionality},
Journal = {ENTROPY},

Volume = {22},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {High-dimensional data and high-dimensional representations of reality
   are inherent features of modern Artificial Intelligence systems and
   applications of machine learning. The well-known phenomenon of the
   ``curse of dimensionality{''} states: many problems become exponentially
   difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the
   ``blessing of dimensionality{''}, has attracted much attention. It turns
   out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple
   geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between
   complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces. Here we present a
   brief explanatory review of recent ideas, results and hypotheses about
   the blessing of dimensionality and related simplifying effects relevant
   to machine learning and neuroscience.},

Title = {Smart-Map: An Open-Source QGIS Plugin for Digital Mapping Using Machine
   Learning Techniques and Ordinary Kriging},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used as an alternative to
   conventional and geostatistical methods in digital mapping of soil
   attributes. An advantage of ML algorithms is their flexibility to use
   various layers of information as covariates. However, ML algorithms come
   in many variations that can make their application by end users
   difficult. To fill this gap, a Smart-Map plugin, which complements
   Geographic Information System QGIS Version 3, was developed using modern
   artificial intelligence (AI) tools. To generate interpolated maps,
   Ordinary Kriging (OK) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm
   were implemented. The SVM model can use vector and raster layers
   available in QGIS as covariates at the time of interpolation. Covariates
   in the SVM model were selected based on spatial correlation measured by
   Moran's Index (I'Moran). To evaluate the performance of the Smart-Map
   plugin, a case study was conducted with data of soil attributes
   collected in an area of 75 ha, located in the central region of the
   state of Goias, Brazil. Performance comparisons between OK and SVM were
   performed for sampling grids with 38, 75, and 112 sampled points. R-2
   and RMSE were used to evaluate the performance of the methods. SVM was
   found superior to OK in the prediction of soil chemical attributes at
   the three sample densities tested and was therefore recommended for
   prediction of soil attributes. In this case study, soil attributes with
   R-2 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.83 and RMSE ranging from 0.07 to 12.01
   were predicted by the methods tested.},

Title = {Implementation of Artificial Intelligence Based Ensemble Models for
   Gully Erosion Susceptibility Assessment},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The Rarh Bengal region in West Bengal, particularly the eastern fringe
   area of the Chotanagpur plateau, is highly prone to water-induced gully
   erosion. In this study, we analyzed the spatial patterns of a potential
   gully erosion in the Gandheswari watershed. This area is highly affected
   by monsoon rainfall and ongoing land-use changes. This combination
   causes intensive gully erosion and land degradation. Therefore, we
   developed gully erosion susceptibility maps (GESMs) using the machine
   learning (ML) algorithms boosted regression tree (BRT), Bayesian
   additive regression tree (BART), support vector regression (SVR), and
   the ensemble of the SVR-Bee algorithm. The gully erosion inventory maps
   are based on a total of 178 gully head-cutting points, taken as the
   dependent factor, and gully erosion conditioning factors, which serve as
   the independent factors. We validated the ML model results using the
   area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), true skill statistic (TSS),
   and Kappa coefficient index. The AUC result of the BRT, BART, SVR, and
   SVR-Bee models are 0.895, 0.902, 0.927, and 0.960, respectively, which
   show very good GESM accuracies. The ensemble model provides more
   accurate prediction results than any single ML model used in this study.},

Title = {ScalpEye: A Deep Learning-Based Scalp Hair Inspection and Diagnosis
   System for Scalp Health},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {134826-134837},
Abstract = {Many people suffer from scalp hair problems such as dandruff,
   folliculitis, hair loss, and oily hair due to poor daily habits,
   imbalanced nutritional intake, high stress, and toxic substances in
   their environment. To treat these scalp problems, dedicated services
   such as scalp hair physiotherapy have emerged in recent years. This
   article proposes a deep learning-based intelligent scalp inspection and
   diagnosis system, named ScalpEye, as an efficient inspection and
   diagnosis system for scalp hair physiotherapy as part of scalp
   healthcare. The proposed ScalpEye system consists of a portable scalp
   hair imaging microscope, a mobile device app, a cloud-based artificial
   intelligence (AI) training server, and a cloud-based management
   platform. The ScalpEye system can detect and diagnose four common scalp
   hair symptoms (dandruff, folliculitis, hair loss, and oily hair). In
   this study, we tested several popular object detection models and
   adopted a Faster R-CNN with the Inception ResNet\_v2\_Atrous model in
   the ScalpEye system for image recognition when inspecting and diagnosing
   scalp hair symptoms. The experimental results show that the ScalpEye
   system can diagnose four common scalp hair symptoms with an average
   precision (AP) ranging from 97.41\% to 99.09\%.},

Title = {Explainable artificial intelligence-based edge fuzzy images for COVID-19
   detection and identification},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {123},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the world's
   population's health and wellbeing. Successful screening of infected
   patients is a critical step in the fight against it, with radiology
   examination using chest radiography being one of the most important
   screening methods. For the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease,
   reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remains the gold
   standard. Currently available lab tests may not be able to detect all
   infected individuals; new screening methods are required. We propose a
   Multi-Input Transfer Learning COVID-Net fuzzy convolutional neural
   network to detect COVID-19 instances from torso X-ray, motivated by the
   latter and the open-source efforts in this research area. Furthermore,
   we use an explainability method to investigate several Convolutional
   Networks COVID-Net forecasts in an effort to not only gain deeper
   insights into critical factors associated with COVID-19 instances, but
   also to aid clinicians in improving screening. We show that using
   transfer learning and pre-trained models, we can detect it with a high
   degree of accuracy. Using X-ray images, we chose four neural networks to
   predict its probability. Finally, in order to achieve better results, we
   considered various methods to verify the techniques proposed here. As a
   result, we were able to create a model with an AUC of 1.0 and accuracy,
   precision, and recall of 0.97. The model was quantized for use in
   Internet of Things devices and maintained a 0.95 percent accuracy. (C)

   promising applications to radiology quality improvement initiatives as
   they relate to the radiology value network. Coordination within the
   interlocking web of systems, events, and stakeholders in the radiology

Abstract = {The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the potential of gene
   expression programming (GEP) in anticipating the compressive strength of
   circular CFRP confined concrete columns. A new GEP model has been
   developed based on a credible and extensive database of 828 data points
   to date. Numerous analyses were carried out to evaluate and validate the
   presented model by comparing them with those presented previously by
   different researchers along with external validation comparison. In
   comparison to other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface
   system (ANFIS), only GEP has the capability and robustness to provide
   output in the form of a simple mathematical relationship that is easy to
   use. The developed GEP model is also compared with linear and nonlinear
   regression models to evaluate the performance. Afterwards, a detailed
   parametric and sensitivity analysis confirms the generalized nature of
   the newly established model. Sensitivity analysis results indicate the
   performance of the model by evaluating the relative contribution of
   explanatory variables involved in development. Moreover, the Taylor
   diagram is also established to visualize how the proposed model
   outperformed other existing models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
   being closer to the target. Lastly, the criteria of external validation
   were also fulfilled by the GEP model much better than other conventional
   models. These findings show that the presented model effectively
   forecasts the confined strength of circular concrete columns
   significantly better than the previously established conventional
   regression-based models.},

Title = {Identification of Nontechnical Losses in Distribution Systems Adding
   Exogenous Data and Artificial Intelligence},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nontechnical losses (NTL) are irregularities in the consumption of
   electricity and mainly caused by theft and fraud. NTLs can be
   characterized as outliers in historical data series. The use of
   computational tools to identify outliers is the subject of research
   around the world, and in this context, artificial neural networks (ANN)
   are applicable. ANNs are machine learning models that learn through
   experience, and their performance is associated with the quality of the
   training data together with the optimization of the model's architecture
   and hyperparameters. This article proposes a complete solution
   (end-to-end) using the ANN multilayer perceptron (MLP) model with
   supervised classification learning. For this, data mining concepts are
   applied to exogenous data, specifically the ambient temperature, and
   endogenous data from energy companies. The association of these data
   results in the improvement of the model's input data that impact the
   identification of consumer units with NTLs. The test results show the
   importance of combining exogenous and endogenous data, which obtained a
   0.0213 improvement in ROC-AUC and a 6.26\% recall (1).},

Abstract = {Speed-torque performance, size, and cost factors, brushless dc motor
   motors (BLDCMs) are in exceptionally high demand in low-powered
   electrical vehicle as well as commercial applications. This research
   proposes a novel technique in smart knob for brushless motor based on
   fielded oriented control (FOC) in green manufacturing with machine
   learning techniques in industry 4.0. here the principle of brushless
   motor is developed based on smart knob with FOC. Then, the operation of
   brushless motor is monitored for fault analysis using convolutional
   Q-Gaussian hidden neural networks. The experimental analysis is carried
   out for the operation of brushless motor with their principle in terms
   of power density, peak power pulse, Model Accuracy, model loss, and Mean
   Average Error. Because sensor less technology has improved traditional
   control and sensing techniques, BLDC motor drivers now perform and
   operate more reliably. Then, recent innovations in this field are
   discussed, together with their benefits and disadvantages, and analysis
   is provided of their actual implementation problems and applications.},

Title = {Disease classification for whole-blood DNA methylation: Meta-analysis,
   missing values imputation, and XAI},
Journal = {GIGASCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Background: DNA methylation has a significant effect on gene expression
   and can be associated with various diseases. Meta-analysis of available
   DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for
   joint data processing.
   Results: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation
   datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data
   harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models,
   dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and
   explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence
   (XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification
   accuracy by up to 20\% when preprocessing methods of the training and
   test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained
   with tree ensembles, reaching above 95\% for Parkinson's disease.
   Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of
   features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best
   imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for
   data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have
   allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and
   individual perspectives.
   Conclusions: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive
   approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with
   various diseases based onwhole-blood DNAmethylation data using
   Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed
   algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a
   complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems
   for meta-analysis ofmany different datasets, imputemissing values, and
   build classificationmodels of small dimensionality.},
