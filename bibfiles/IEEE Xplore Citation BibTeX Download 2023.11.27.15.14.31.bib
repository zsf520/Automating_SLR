  abstract={In the present paper, a framework for the continued supporting a systematic literature review (SLR) is proposed, which includes the application of text mining methods in order to automate the classification of scientific publications and the more in-depth analysis of their content. For this purpose, a dataset is created from the titles, abstracts and keywords of papers, included in a systematic literature review on the application of semantic technologies in bibliographic databases. Data analytics methods are applied - frequency analysis of words and word combinations; linear regression for trend exploration; text classification, where the categories are the applied semantic technologies or the researched problems in accordance with a pre-defined classification framework. The vector space model enriched with PMI (pointwise mutual information) measure is used for the classification. An assessment of the text classification performance in terms of various measures is made and the obtained results are summarized.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Crop monitoring and diagnosis are crucial for efficient agricultural production, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Remote Sensing can assist in achieving this goal. This article offers an automated Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of UAV Remote Sensing for crop monitoring and diagnosis. This review analyzes the primary scientific applications and trends in this area using Deep Learning techniques to automatically select relevant articles and validate them through full reading. The SLR collected over 800 papers, of which 64 met the selection process. The articles selected by Deep Learning classifiers were successfully cataloged with high accuracy in pre-selecting articles for review. F1 scores of 93% were achieved in tests with unpublished examples for the classifier model. The review of the 64 primary studies reported a peak in UAV Remote Sensing applications in 2020, attributed to the increasing diffusion of precision farming practices with technological equipment. The UAV Remote Sensing application objectives included crop monitoring, pest and disease detection, yield prediction, and plant nutrition. Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are widely used for UAV Remote Sensing analysis. The NDVI is the most applied vegetation index for crop condition assessment and monitoring. The proposed solution for automating the literature selection process for precision agriculture-related scientific articles can be used in other areas that require extensive literature review.},

  pages={156392-156421},
  abstract={Nowadays, reliability assurance is crucial in components of IT infrastructures. Unavailability of any element or connection results in downtime and triggers monetary and performance casualties. Thus, reliability engineering has been a topic of investigation recently. The system logs become obligatory in IT infrastructure monitoring for failure detection, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses on detailed analysis based on the various qualitative and performance merits of datasets used, technical approaches utilized, and automated tools developed. The full-text review was directed by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. 102 articles were extracted from Scopus, IEEE Explore, WoS, and ACM for a thorough examination. Also, a few more supplementary articles were studied by applying Snowballing technique. The study emphasizes the use of system logs for anomaly or failure detection and prediction. The survey encapsulates the automated tools under various quality merit criteria. This SLR ascertained that machine learning and deep learning-based classification approaches employed on selected features enable enhanced performance than traditional rule-based and method-based approaches. Additionally, the paper discusses research gaps in the existing literature and provides future research directions. The primary intent of this SLR is to perceive and inspect various tools and techniques proposed to mitigate IT infrastructure downtime in the existing literature. This survey will encourage prospective researchers to understand the pros and cons of current methods and pick an excellent approach to solve their identified problems in the field of IT infrastructure.},

  abstract={Background: Systematic Literature Reviews are an important research method for gathering and evaluating the available evidence regarding a specific research topic. However, the process of conducting a Systematic Literature Review manually can be difficult and time-consuming. For this reason, researchers aim to semi-automate this process or some of its phases.Aim: We aimed at using a deep-learning based contextualized embeddings clustering technique involving transformer-based language models and a weighted scheme to accelerate the conduction phase of Systematic Literature Reviews for efficiently scanning the initial set of retrieved publications.Method: We performed an experiment using two manually conducted SLRs to evaluate the performance of two deep-learning-based clustering models. These models build on transformer-based deep language models (i.e., BERT and S-BERT) to extract contextualized embeddings on different text levels along with a weighted scheme to cluster similar publications.Results: Our primary results show that clustering based on embedding at paragraph-level using S-BERT-paragraph represents the best performing model setting in terms of optimizing the required parameters such as correctly identifying primary studies, number of additional documents identified as part of the relevant cluster and the execution time of the experiments.Conclusions: The findings indicate that using natural-language-based deep-learning architectures for semi-automating the selection of primary studies can accelerate the scanning and identification process. While our results represent first insights only, such a technique seems to enhance SLR process, promising to help researchers identify the most relevant publications more quickly and efficiently.},

  pages={72894-72936},
  abstract={The unstructured data impacts 95% of the organizations and costs them millions of dollars annually. If managed well, it can significantly improve business productivity. The traditional information extraction techniques are limited in their functionality, but AI-based techniques can provide a better solution. A thorough investigation of AI-based techniques for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents is missing in the literature. The purpose of this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to recognize, and analyze research on the techniques used for automatic information extraction from unstructured documents and to provide directions for future research. The SLR guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters were adhered to conduct a literature search on various databases between 2010 and 2020. We found that: 1. The existing information extraction techniques are template-based or rule-based, 2. The existing methods lack the capability to tackle complex document layouts in real-time situations such as invoices and purchase orders, 3. The datasets available publicly are task-specific and of low quality. Hence, there is a need to develop a new dataset that reflects real-world problems. Our SLR discovered that AI-based approaches have a strong potential to extract useful information from unstructured documents automatically. However, they face certain challenges in processing multiple layouts of the unstructured documents. Our SLR brings out conceptualization of a framework for construction of high-quality unstructured documents dataset with strong data validation techniques for automated information extraction. Our SLR also reveals a need for a close association between the businesses and researchers to handle various challenges of the unstructured data analysis.},

Although automated software testing has been a topic of research for many years, automation testing on mobile application is being a key topic in the software engineering industry and hence the development and introduction of new automated tools have gained attention in the recent years. This research aims at identifying, analyzing, and synthesizing the current state-of-the-art of automated testing on mobile application with special focus on to the popular mobile application platform "Android". A systematic literature review was conducted on studies retrieved from electronic search space. Various literature reviewed and referred there in, as a conclusion, its obvious that none of the techniques used in automated testing is alone inadequate and a combination of them works well as an effective testing strategy. Also, the challenges thus faced by the practitioners of automated testing could be still mitigated with an efficient selection of testing tool.},

  pages={673-679},
  abstract={The success of procurement process in construction projects is based on the total procured material's cost and time of delivery. However, in Bahrain, the clients face a time and cost loss due to the construction sector's dependence on paper-based procurement mediums, fragmentation of the building process between clients, contractors and suppliers, and control of contractors in providing materials. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a development of a mobile application prototype that is expected to act as an automated procurement medium, act as a central medium of communication, and provide a direct link between clients and suppliers. This is believed to enhance the excessive cost and time of procured construction materials. Methodologically, a waterfall System development life cycle (SDLC) methodology of two phases and seven processes was employed to develop the mobile application “SARAY”, while systematic literature review (SLR) and content analysis in addition to two questionnaire techniques were all employed to identify the problems facing the procurement process, and collect user requirements along with a third questionnaire was employed to evaluate the application's usability based on Nielsen and mobile heuristics. Empirically, research findings revealed the existence of the problem, identified the reasons and requirements underpinning, and informed the need for a dynamic mobile application prototype supplemented by 82.7% of respondents who confirmed the time and cost loss of regular procurement and 59.7% and 92% willingness of development of such a mobile application for individual and company levels. In terms of the development, eight user and system functional requirements were collected, analyzed, & documented, including, register supplier, register client, manage client and supplier records, create and manage supplier store, select material, place an order, make Payment, and manage order. User interfaces & database records were designed, implemented, installed, tested, and evaluated, demonstrating 86% of usability achievement.},

  abstract={The paper deals with traffic simulation within roundabouts when both “connected and automated vehicles” (CAVs) and human-driven cars are present. The aim is to present the past, current and future research on CAVs running into roundabouts within the Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) framework. Both microscopic traffic simulations and virtual reality simulations by dynamic driving simulators will be considered. The paper is divided into five parts. At first, the literature is analysed using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology based on Scopus database. Secondly, the influence of CAVs on roundabout-specific design features and configuration is analysed. Gap-acceptance models used to define the capacity of the roundabout, one of its most important key performance indicators, are also presented. Third, the most common simulation software are described and analysed in terms of traffic demand implementation. Then the communication approaches and path management algorithms are studied. An example is proposed on the integration of microscopic traffic simulations and dynamic driving simulators virtual reality simulations. Finally, car following models suitable for roundabout traffic are discussed. There is still a gap between simulations and actual experience. There are reasonable doubts on how modelling and optimizing CAVs’ behaviour into roundabouts in view of CCAM. It seems that Cooperative, Connected and Automated Vehicles (CCAVs), more than simply Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), could optimise traffic flow, safety and driving comfort within the roundabout. A very promising technology for traffic simulation within the roundabout seems the one based on dynamic driving simulators.},

  abstract={Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), in the context of cooperative intelligent transportation systems (C-ITS), are capable of exchanging information with each other and the infrastructure. They can also form platoons that can drive with shorter time headways resulting in potential higher capacity, smoother flow, less fuel consumption, and reduction in collisions. However, the literature assessing their impacts is still fragmented and does not provide a solid evidence base about their potential contributions, particularly that they are not widely deployed yet. This study aims to establish this evidence using a systematic literature review (SLR) of the relevant body of knowledge. In this paper, 347 journal publications from 2000 to 2021, are analyzed and critiqued. Comprehensive bibliographic and co-citation analyses are conducted to uncover the key findings and bring out a valid and balanced perspective of CAVs and their impacts on traffic operations. A co-citation analysis of the body of knowledge on this topic resulted in the formation of four main clusters of research focus that included safety, efficiency, communication, and technology. This SLR presents an unbiased and objective summary of scientific findings on the topic and serves as a starting point for future investigations on CAVs by identifying research gaps, limitations and challenges, and potential areas of research to overcome these challenges.},

  abstract={Algae represent the majority of the diversity on Earth and are a large group of organisms that have photosynthetic properties that are important to life. The species of algae are estimated to be more than 1 million, they play an important role in many fields such as agriculture, industry, food, and medicine. It is important to determine the type of algae, to determine if it is harmful or useful, and to indicate the health of the ecosystem, water quality, health, and safety risks. The conventional process of classifying algae is difficult, tedious, and time-consuming. Recently various computer vision techniques have been used to classify algae to overcome challenges and automate the process of classification. This paper presents a review of research done on image classification for microorganism algae using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The paper focuses on three important research questions to highlight the challenges of classifying microalgae. A systematic literature review or SLR has been conducted to determine how deep learning and machine learning have improved and enhanced automatic microalgae classification rather than manual classification. 51 articles have been included from well-known databases. The outcome of this SLR is beneficial due to the detailed analysis and comprehensive overview of the algorithms and the architectures and information about the dataset used in each included article. The future work focuses on getting a large dataset with high resolution, trying different methods to manage imbalance problems, and giving more attention to the fusion of deep learning techniques and traditional machine learning techniques.},

  abstract={The User Interface (UI) is a fundamental part of web interfaces, being considered a fundamental aspect of user satisfaction when using a web application. The UI that offers a good User Experience (UX) is the one that makes the interaction as simple and efficient as possible for the user to achieve the previously desired goals. In this way, web interfaces that have adaptive interfaces tend to offer a better UX, as they seek to adapt to the needs and desires of users. Therefore, this paper carries out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the most used algorithms for the development of Adaptive Web Interfaces (AWI). The results indicate that the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, both to improve the performance of some task and to induce results, are the most popular ways to develop AWI. During the execution of SLR, 294 articles were analyzed using automated and manual searches, and inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria were applied to them. The research findings allow us to state that the topic is quite relevant to the academic community, with an average publication of 20 papers each year.1},

  abstract={With technological advances in recent decades, cattle farms are constantly striving to optimize local milk production. Several tools can help manage milking waves and the milking process, such as the Body Condition Score (BCS), an important tool for analyzing cattle health and making intelligent decisions to optimize milk production on a farm. Although the BCS is a useful tool, it is not widely used due to the difficulty of performing its analysis, as it has been found that manual assessments can be very time-consuming on large farms with hundreds of cows. Therefore, it would be useful to automate this process. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic classification of BCS of cattle using computer vision techniques based primarily on deep learning systems, machine learning techniques or linear regression, and classical image processing. This systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using standard methods for documentary research. The SLR included a search for related research and the current state of the art for cattle body condition classification. By exploring the potential of modern systems, this work is expected to provide a new perspective on the automatic classification of BCS and enable a more accurate and reliable evaluation of cattle body condition.},

  abstract={Essays are frequently employed in the educational system to gauge students' comprehension of particular subjects. However, marking essays requires a lot of time and work and could be prejudiced. In order to save time, lessen human effort, and eliminate biased scoring, automated essay scoring tries to automate scoring. Due to its lack of transparency, limited language support, and requirement for tagged data for the target prompt, which is not always available, AES is still not frequently utilized. This study's goal is to examine automated essay scoring methods. The PRISMA Flow Diagram is used in this study to conduct a systematic literature review. Studies that were released between 2016 and 2021 were found. Information pertinent to the research topics is taken from these studies and then processed to provide a response. Datasets, methods, and models are found in the publications. The performance score of models utilizing the same dataset is then used to compare them. According to the study, AES uses feature engineering and deep learning as its two core methodologies. More scholars are currently researching the deep-learning methodology. CNN, LSTM, and BERT are a few examples of neural network models used in the deep learning method. Most studies use the average QWK and the ASAP dataset as performance metrics. SBLSTMA (Siamese Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network Architecture) and BERT + handcrafted-features, both with 0.801 average QWK, are the models with the highest performance score on the ASAP datasets.},

  pages={4181-4213},
  abstract={Third-party libraries (TPLs) have been widely used in mobile apps, which play an essential part in the entire Android ecosystem. However, TPL is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can ease the development of mobile apps. On the other hand, it also brings security risks such as privacy leaks or increased attack surfaces (e.g., by introducing over-privileged permissions) to mobile apps. Although there are already many studies for characterizing third-party libraries, including automated detection, security and privacy analysis of TPLs, TPL attributes analysis, etc., what strikes us odd is that there is no systematic study to summarize those studies’ endeavors. To this end, we conduct the first systematic literature review on Android TPL-related research. Following a well-defined systematic literature review protocol, we collected 74 primary research papers closely related to Android third-party library from 2012 to 2020. After carefully examining these studies, we designed a taxonomy of TPL-related research studies and conducted a systematic study to summarize current solutions, limitations, challenges and possible implications of new research directions related to third-party library analysis. We hope that these contributions can give readers a clear overview of existing TPL-related studies and inspire them to go beyond the current status quo by advancing the discipline with innovative approaches.},

  abstract={Nowadays, processing vehicle license plate data has become a common and challenging subject of research in Image Processing and Artificial Intelligence. There are various methods proposed to address this problem due to the different shapes and sizes of license plates in different countries. License plate recognition can be used for different purposes, including parking lots, public and private entrances, traffic monitoring systems, cargo control in airports or harbours, and security issues such as finding stolen cars. The technology for license plate recognition is known by different names, including automatic number-plate recognition, automatic vehicle identification, car license plate recognition, and optical character recognition for cars. This technology converts image data from a camera into a character format that can be processed in a database for specific applications. Optical character recognition methods can identify the characters on license plates with great accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to provide a systematic literature review of the most common challenges and methods used for optical character recognition in automated number plate recognition systems, as well as their level of recognition accuracy.},

  abstract={Technical debt in general refers to suboptimal decisions the practitioners make during software development that achieve short-term goals at the expense of long-term quality concerns. Architecture technical debt is a subset of technical debt, when software practitioners make wrong or sub-optimal decisions related to the architecture of the software. Identifying such architecture technical debt plays a crucial role in software quality. In the last decade, there were several methods proposed to identify architecture debts in the literature.In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review of methods that identify architecture technical debt by inspecting 28 primary studies published from 2011 to 2020. Based on the outcomes of our review: (1) design rule space and traceability graphs are the dominant techniques; (2) despite the increase of automated techniques in identifying architecture debt, pure manual methods using expert opinion is still popular; (3) majority of the approaches use code/version history to mine archictural technical debt; (4) the field is getting increasingly more attraction in the last five years.},

This study provides a comparative analysis of online examination techniques & tools performed on 23 studies from the last five years 2017 to 2021. Furthermore, in this time duration five leading cheating prevention features are identified.14 important techniques which are mostly used in this time duration are found in which best frequent approach used in literature is NLP and 10 data sets including both public and private are identified. Proceeding toward the proposed solution, a total of 20 tools for the anti-cheat examinations are found. Almost 23 leading existing tools were found in the literature. To narrow down the criteria for adoption factor is analyzed and studies of the online anti-cheat examination solution adoption in different countries are also investigated. Finally, the overall cost of the e-learning infrastructure, specifically the conduction of examinations is determined by comparing the key factors of the global adoption with major online exam features.},

  abstract={This work aims to investigate, by means of a Systematic Literature Review, to evaluate the current state of the use of artificial intelligence in automated pupillometric technology and its application in helping to diagnose diseases, to identify the methods and equipment used and propose case new equipment based on computer vision is feasible. We also investigated the accuracy of methodologies and equipment that use computerized pupilometry to identify pathologies or disorders, as well as the viability and usability of existing pupilometers. In this sense, creating a pupilometer capable of stimulating and varying wavelengths, providing an interface to preview the exam, and embedding the classification algorithms is a great challenge. In this systematic review of the literature, we consider publications from the last ten years (2010 - 2020) indexed by seven solid scientific databases. The review identified a vast amount of work on pupillometry; however, a small amount related to the construction and viability of a pupilometer with an embedded system, easy to use and with a preview interface. Having identified this, we propose a new methodology for the construction of the pupilometer as well as the algorithm for extracting the characteristics through pupilometry.},

  pages={1568-1586},
  abstract={Users can interact with one another through social networks (SNs) by exchanging information, delivering comments, finding new information, and engaging in discussions that result in the production of vast volumes of data daily. These data, available in various forms, such as images, text, and videos, may be interpreted to reflect the user’s activities, including their mental state regarding depression. For example, depression is a chronic disease from which the vast majority of users suffer, and it has emerged as a significant issue relating to mental health on a global scale. However, because these data are scant, unfinished, and sometimes given inaccurately, it is challenging to make an accurate automated diagnosis from them. Even though several procedures have been utilized over the past few decades to diagnose depression, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques supply superior insights. Thus, in this study, we review several state-of-the-art ML and DL techniques in terms of the systematic literature review (SLR) approach for depression detection. We also highlight some critical challenges from the existing literature that may help to explore for future study. Finally, we believe this survey will help readers and researchers in ML and DL to understand critical solutions in diagnosing depression.},

  abstract={The discipline of information systems (IS) at the university of Bahrain (UOB) is characterized by its dynamicity and diversity in terms of the employment of diverse and up to date information technologies to achieve the strategic goals and dynamic operational objectives of organizations. However, the UOB-IS graduates and IS job employers alongside face difficulties in job seeking/provision. Seekers hardly find the best matching job offerings to their degree qualifications and skills, while employers hardly find the best candidates for the required job positions. This project is aimed at developing a Bahraini web-based job offering portal (J4IS) that acts as an automated recruiter for the job seekers and employers to facilitate an efficient and professional medium of communication and time and cost reduction tool to seek/provide suitable jobs for both sides. The theoretical framework is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and web content analysis (CA) techniques. For the portal's application development, a six phased system development life cycle (SDLC) methodology was employed at which three questionnaires, two of which were conducted for collecting user and system requirements, while the third was for the web portal's evaluation. The research outcomes recognized the nature of the Bahraini workforce and the qualifications and skills of the UOB-IS graduates, the shortcomings of the commercial online job portals and the related reasons, and subsequently informed the user (seekers and employers) requirements of the developed “J4IS” which revealed a 94% of usability acceptance.},

  pages={178-182},
  abstract={Nowadays, the online shopping cycle has experienced a rapid increase. Customers are spending more time on social media, which leads to them leaving digital footprints on the internet and generating massive amounts of data. With the help of machine learning, the process of gathering and analysing data becomes faster and easier. However, a recent survey shows that most marketing firms lack an effective personalization strategy for reaching their target market. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find out how machine learning can be used to solve the personalization problem in digital marketing and its impact on future businesses. The authors would like to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on machine learning and big data in digital marketing based on previous studies related to this topic. Several previous studies have tried to provide effective ways to improve personalization strategies in digital marketing. These studies show that machine learning can speed up the marketing process with the right target. This is because machine learning can automate, optimize, then collect data, analyse it, and store data from each user. This allows a promotion system that is right on target according to the users' needs. In general, the authors conclude that by using big data, machine learning can help marketing companies to create more effective personalized marketing strategies so that they can be directed to the right consumers. The authors also believe that this topic of personalization should be further researched for future businesses.},

The citizens concern about the potential risks, that are mainly related to data security, respectively documents falsification in a corrupted and non-transparent government. Not only in terms of administrative efficiency, but also in terms of boosting confidence, transparency, and accessibility of services, blockchain technology has the potential to play a major role in the digitalization of the public sector. Blockchain-based solutions facilitate citizen-government collaboration by safely streamlining and automating procedures while maintaining privacy and secrecy. To better understand the adoption of blockchain in public administration, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) including 32 primary papers in this study. We intend to address one of the Informatics Society's major concerns: the data security of thousands of individuals and the inviolability of citizen databases.

  abstract={The echocardiogram (ECHO) is an ultrasound of the heart used to diagnose heart diseases (DHC). The analysis and interpretation of ECHO are dependent on the doctor's experience. However, software that uses artificial intelligence to analyze ECHO images or videos is contributing to support the physician's decision. This paper aims to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques applied in the automation of Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) processes, to support medical decisions. The study identified more than 800 articles on the topic in the leading scientific research platforms. To select the most relevant studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, where 45 articles were selected to compose the detailed study of the SRL. The results obtained with the extraction of information from the papers, identified 3 groups of primary studies, namely: identification of the cardiac vision plan, analysis of cardiac functions and detection of cardiac diseases. SRL identifies that the set of Machine learning (ML) techniques are being widely applied in the tasks of segmentation, detection and classification of images obtained from ECHO. The techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), presented the best Accuracy rates. Research shows a strong interest in automating ECHO processes. However, it is still an open research field, with the potential to generate many publications for researchers.},

  pages={4213-4242},
  abstract={Microservices architecture has gained significant traction, in part owing to its potential to deliver scalable, robust, agile, and failure-resilient software products. Consequently, many companies that use large and complex software systems are actively looking for automated solutions to decompose their monolith applications into microservices. This paper rigorously examines 35 research papers selected from well-known databases using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol and snowballing method, extracting data to answer the research questions, and presents the following four contributions. First, the Monolith to Microservices Decomposition Framework (M2MDF) which identifies the major phases and key elements of decomposition. Second, a detailed analysis of existing decomposition approaches, tools and methods. Third, we identify the metrics and datasets used to evaluate and validate monolith to microservice decomposition processes. Fourth, we propose areas for future research. Overall, the findings suggest that monolith decomposition into microservices remains at an early stage and there is an absence of methods for combining static, dynamic, and evolutionary data. Insufficient tool support is also in evidence. Furthermore, standardised metrics, datasets, and baselines have yet to be established. These findings can assist practitioners seeking to understand the various dimensions of monolith decomposition and the community's current capabilities in that endeavour. The findings are also of value to researchers looking to identify areas to further extend research in the monolith decomposition space.},

  pages={1-12},
  abstract={Organisations have been collecting big data - high volume structured and unstructured data - at a rapid rate from a range of different sources. Big data can add value to organisations if processed, analysed and presented correctly. Organisations can benefit significantly from big data analytics if they have the capability to uncover hidden information from fully automated decision-making process. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the ability of big data analytics to replace managerial decision-making. A systematic literature review approach is used to review relevant studies that are validated through qualitative data analysis. The potential to replace managerial decision-making with fully automated data driven decisions varies per problem domain. There is evidence that managerial, operational and tactical decision-making can be replaced by big data analytics for stable conditions using structured data. From the study, European countries are the ones benefiting highly from tactical and operational decisions without managerial control. Decision-makers should, therefore, re-evaluate strategic decisions resulting from automated processing from unstable conditions for high quality decisions and prevention of errors. Finding from an African context were based on case studies from Egypt, Morocco and South Africa. The case study from Egypt used an experimental case on retail sector with proven decisions effectiveness.},

  abstract={Manufacturing industries require the highest quality and efficiency throughout their value chain, to compete with countries having a labor cost advantage. Today, manufacturing firms are in a fast-phased run to automate their processes and increase value chain integration through advanced technologies. Industry 4.0 has gained traction within this community, where its components like IoT, Big data, and Cloud computing are being used by manufacturing firms to optimize and increase the efficiency of their workplaces. Obtaining the proper outcomes from these advanced technologies has been an issue for most of its users. Very few studies were found in the literature, that propose ways to mitigate the issues faced by these companies in their Industry 4.0 journey. Lean concepts are a popular and proven methodology used by firms worldwide to decrease the complexity and increase the productivity of their processes. Based on a systematic literature review, the study identifies the current knowledge on mitigating the barriers faced by manufacturing firms in Industry 4.0 implementations. To address the knowledge gap identified in the literature review, the study proposes and statistically tests a framework, on how the manufacturing environment can be improved to obtain the expected outcomes of Industry 4.0 implementations, through a lean theoretical lens. Thus, the stakeholders of the company can contribute towards successful implementations of Industry 4.0 while organizational processes are being standardized and optimized to integrate these advanced technological shifts.},

  pages={1072-1079},
  abstract={Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that adversely affects the social life of the affected people. Nearly 65 million people were affected worldwide. In many cases, (nearly30%) of this disease cannot be healed with medications. However, seizure prediction will help in disease prevention. Encephalogram is the common test that helps to diagnose the epilepsy. The electrical activity of human brain can be recorded as EEG signals. The manual inspection to detect abnormalities in the epileptic form is more time-consuming and inaccurate. This arises a need for automated framework that helps in precisely distinguishing EEG signals. Various researchers have employed different machine-learning models for seizure prediction. But achieving high performance is still a challenging task. The proposed model provides a reliable system for seizure prediction with improved performance by using different ANN models. Neural network is presently a blazing technique in machine learning paradigm, which constitutes noble success in several healthcare data analysis. There are many ML models available for seizure detection with EEG signals. The existing models preprocess the data and extract the feature before classification. According to our knowledge, there is no work with ANN for seizure classification has been done on the preprocessed clinical dataset. This research work proposes a framework with preprocessed dataset and extracted time domain features. The proposed system provides automated seizure prediction framework, which integrates random-forest method for feature selection and ANN classifiers for seizure prediction. There are several forms of neural network, where everyone have their individual precise use case. In the proposed framework, different ANN methods like ANN with resilient back-propagation with weights, ANN with resilient back-propagation without weights and two types of globally convergent methods are used as classifiers with sigmoid as activation function and they are trained and tested as trail and error method to find the best number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer. According to the results, this framework provides a expedite analysis with the selected attributes of EEG signals to detect seizures and reduces time complexity in analyzing the large datasets. Among different ANN methods(RPROP+, RPROP-, SAG, SLR), SLR provides good accuracy as 99.56 % and precision as 99.2%.},

  abstract={It is essential for neuroscience and clinic to estimate the influence of neuro-intervention after brain damage. Most related studies have used Mirrored Contralesional-Ipsilesional hemispheres (MCI) methods flipping the axial neuroimaging on the x-axis in prognosis prediction. But left-right hemispheric asymmetry in the brain has become a consensus. MCI confounds the intrinsic brain asymmetry with the asymmetry caused by unilateral damage, leading to questions about the reliability of the results and difficulties in physiological explanations. We proposed the Separated Left-Right hemiplegia (SLR) method to model left and right hemiplegia separately. Two pipelines have been designed in contradistinction to demonstrate the validity of the SLR method, including MCI and removing intrinsic asymmetry (RIA) pipelines. A patient dataset with 18 left-hemiplegic and 22 right-hemiplegic stroke patients and a healthy dataset with 40 subjects, age- and sex-matched with the patients, were selected in the experiment. Blood-Oxygen Level-Dependent MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging were used to build brain networks whose nodes were defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas. We applied the same statistical and machine learning framework for all pipelines, logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine for classifying the patients who are significant or non-significant responders to brain-computer interfaces assisted training and optimal subset regression, support vector regression for predicting post-intervention outcomes. The SLR pipeline showed 5-15% improvement in accuracy and at least 0.1 upgrades in  $\text{R}^{{2}}$ , revealing common and unique recovery mechanisms after left and right strokes and helping clinicians make rehabilitation plans.},

  abstract={Social media platforms are popular for expressing personal views, emotions and beliefs. Social media platforms are influential for propagating extremist ideologies for group-building, fund-raising, and recruitment. To monitor and control the outreach of extremists on social media, detection of extremism in social media is necessary. The existing extremism detection literature on social media is limited by specific ideology, subjective validation methods, and binary or tertiary classification. A comprehensive and comparative survey of datasets, classification techniques, validation methods with online extremism detection tool is essential. The systematic literature review methodology (PRISMA) was used. Sixty-four studies on extremism research were collected, including 31 from SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS), ACM, IEEE, and 33 thesis, technical and analytical reports using Snowballing technique. The survey highlights the role of social media in propagating online radicalization and the need for extremism detection on social media platforms. The review concludes lack of publicly available, class-balanced, and unbiased datasets for better detection and classification of social-media extremism. Lack of validation techniques to evaluate correctness and quality of custom data sets without human interventions, was found. The information retrieval unveiled that contemporary research work is prejudiced towards ISIS ideology. We investigated that deep learning based automated extremism detection techniques outperform other techniques. The review opens the research opportunities for developing an online, publicly available automated tool for extremism data collection and detection. The survey results in conceptualization of architecture for construction of multi-ideology extremism text dataset with robust data validation techniques for multiclass classification of extremism text.},

  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={37658-37669},
  abstract={Traditional methods of capturing people’s dietary intake are complex and labour-intensive, requiring a high level of literacy and time. Speech recording has potential to reduce these barriers, and recent technological advances have greatly increased the viability of this approach. The aim of this paper is to establish the current state of research on the usage of speech records in dietary assessment. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review and summarised the current state of research along a conceptual framework that captures the components involved in using speech records for dietary assessment. Six databases from the nutrition and computing domains were interrogated, resulting in 21 relevant papers. Speech recording in an unstructured format was preferred when compared against other methods by all three studies reporting comparisons. High technological satisfaction and ease of use were noted by all eight studies reporting user acceptance. When recording data, 78% of studies focused on collecting prospective food records. The choice of device reflected this, with 15 of 18 studies reporting a form of handheld, portable collection device intended to be always available. To process data, nine studies performed automated speech transcription achieving an average accuracy of 83%, seven of which utilized a readily available commercial service. Of the five studies that used natural language processing to further automate analysis, an average accuracy of 82% was reported. Further research is required to adapt these prototypes to address practical challenges in dietary assessment and monitoring (e.g. self-monitoring for low-literacy users).},

  abstract={With the advent of the autonomous vehicle, there is potential to reduce the accident rate to a minimum level. Modern automated vehicles will undoubtedly include machine learning (ML) and probabilistic techniques. These algorithms with a non-deterministic world significantly complicate the safety assessment process. In addition, the autonomous system handles the responsibility of safe navigation, so the vehicle has to ensure its safety by itself. Due to these reasons, it is essential to thoroughly assess the system before deploying it on public roads. However, there are many testing challenges for highly automated vehicles (HAVs) to overcome before the wide-scale deployment. In this paper, we conducted a semi-systematic literature review on several issues and challenges related to the testing of HAVs.},

  abstract={The testing is an integral part of the software development. At the same time, the manual creation of individu-al test cases is a lengthy and error-prone process. Hence, an intensive research on automated test generation methods is ongoing for more than twenty years. There are many vastly dif-ferent approaches, which can be considered automated test case generation. However, a common feature is the generation of the data for the test cases. Ultimately, the test data decide the prog-ram branching and can be used on any testing level, starting with the unit tests and ending with the tests focused on the behavior of the entire application. The test data are also mostly independent on any specific technology, such as programming language or paradigm. This paper is a survey of existing literature of the last two decades that deals with test data generation or with tests based on it. This survey is not a systematic literature review and it does not try to answer specific scientific questions formulated in advance. Its purpose is to map and categorize the existing methods and to summarize their common features. Such a survey can be helpful for any teams developing their methods for test data generation as it can be a starting point for the exploration of related work.},

For numerous computer vision that help to increase communications among hearing impaired, deaf and dumb the sign language identification is a exciting and crucial research area. This research, offers a model with Dynamic Time Wrapping(DTW) approach for recognizing signs in video clips. This innovative technique uses body and hand skeletal features that are derived from RGB movies to capture highly discriminative skeletal data for gesture identification. Experiments on a sizable sign language videos shows that this methodology is better than other cutting-edge methods that just use RGB features. The holistic features extracted as connected key points to identify sign language of the image and accuracy of the results are analyzed.},

  abstract={People who have hearing loss utilise sign language to communicate. It enables gestures and spoken language to communicate with one another by connecting letters, words, and phrases. The hearing-impaired community could benefit from a machine that can translate spoken language into sign language English, allowing them to interact with the general public. They will be helped to improve their skills and become more conscious of what they can do to advance humanity. In this study, we attempted to create an automated system that could identify sign language in challenging environments. It is possible to extract the part of the signer’s hand that matches their skin tone from a video of them signing. From the hand image, Extractive and categorical features that can identify the sign are used. Support vector machine is used for the categorization. India is diverse in terms of religion, culture, and language. There is no recognised sign language in India. There are numerous ISL dialects with verbal variations spoken in India. There are numerous varieties of Sign language, even in Kerala, a small state. In order to recognise the signs unique to our region, we are working to construct a SLR system.},

  pages={27881-27898},
  abstract={Traditionally, network and security operation center teams have worked in silos despite commonalities. The network operating center (NOC) team is to provide operationality and availability of information technology (IT) assets, while the security operation center (SOC) team is to ensure IT assets security and protect them from cyber-security attacks. The convergence in IT assets and exponential growth in cyber-security threats in the present digital-online scenario have created many challenges in maintaining network and IT assets effectively and protecting them. It is vital to break these silos and bring them under one integrated unit to effectively counter cyber-security attacks, threats, and vandalism at a reduced operational cost. Despite its necessity, the relevant literature lacks an opinion. It focuses mainly on conceptual segments instead of a holistic view of an integrated NOC and SOC architecture, limiting further innovations in the field. A systematic literature review and analysis is conducted to collate and understand current research ideas in this paper. The mapped relevant literature and our expertise have been then used to propose the implementable state-of-the-art architecture of an integrated NOC and SOC, its definition, the main building blocks and its usefulness for the organizations. Only explicit knowledge of people is considered while neglecting the tacit knowledge in automating and integrating the processes of NOC and SOC, which is the major limitation of the relevant literature. Taping people tacit knowledge is necessary for utilizing the entire caliber of the NOC and SOC integration in the future.},

  abstract={Success and failure in software engineering are still among the least understood phenomena in the discipline. In a recent special journal issue on the topic, Mäntylä et al. started discussing these topics from different angles; the authors focused their contributions on offering a general overview of both topics without deeper detail. Recognizing the importance and impact of the topic, in this article we have executed a followup, more in-depth systematic literature review with additional analyses beyond what was previously provided. These new analyses offer: a grounded-theory of success and failure factors, harvesting over 500+ factors from the literature; 14 manually validated clusters of factors that provide relevant areas for success- and failure-specific measurement and risk-analysis; a quality model composed of previously unmeasured organizational structure quantities which are germane to software product, process, and community quality. We show that the topics of success and failure deserve further study as well as further automated tool support, e.g., monitoring tools and metrics able to track the factors and patterns emerging from this article. This article provides managers with risks as well as a more fine-grained analysis of the parameters that can be appraised to anticipate the risks.},

  title={EEG signal analysis using deep learning: A systematic literature review}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) is very crucial for understanding the dynamic healthy and pathological complex processes in the brain. However, the manual analysis of the EEG signal is very complex, time-consuming, and depends on the expertise and experience of the users. Hence, nowadays research is conducted on automated EEG signal analysis using artificial intelligence and computer-aided technologies. This would allow fast and highly accurate results. The goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the EEG signal analysis using deep learning (DL).Methods: This systematic literature review of EEG processing using Deep Learning (DL) was achieved on Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, resulting in 403 identified papers. All collected studies were analyzed based on main disorders studied, type of tasks performed, data source, stages of analysis, and DL architecture.Results: DL in EEG processing is promising in various research applications. It covered the common neurological disorders diagnosis such as epilepsy, movement disorder, depression, schizophrenia, autism, alcohol use, attention, memory, sleep, pain, etc. The main tasks covered by the included studies are detection and classification. The average range of data sources utilized by the included studies is 127 subjects with an EEG recording a total duration of 458 hours. In fact, we identified the use of a plethora of DL architecture for EEG analysis. 57% of papers used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whereas Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were the architecture choice of about 12% of papers. Combinations of CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were used in 13% of studies. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Autoencoder (AEs) were used in 5% and 4% of papers respectively. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and other hybrid architectures appeared in 1% of studies.Conclusion: This systematic review showed that DL is a powerful tool to process, analyze, and interpret EEG data without requiring extraction steps. These intelligent models can allow self-learning from the training data. On the other hand, DL models need a lot of data to learn, while suffering from a lack of confidence due to their black-box nature. Hence, studies on transfer learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could help in solving such issues. Big Data, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and closed-loop technology can also help DL-based systems in achieving fast, and accurate processing of EEG recordings.},

  abstract={The use of autonomous systems at wood processing sites of forest industries can significantly increase safety, productivity and efficiency by reducing the number of monotonous and dangerous tasks conducted by human labor utilizing heavy machinery. However, autonomous machine operation in mill yards is challenging because of the dynamic and complex working environment and partly unstructured processes. The inherent complexity of wood handling and storage tasks requires significant human expertise. Rapid advancements in sensor technologies and machine learning techniques, along with increases in available computational power have enabled progress in automated operation frameworks and algorithms development, which opens the door to the introduction of novel autonomous systems into this environment. With the aim of gaining a better understanding of current issues and facilitating optimal strategies for the deployment of high-level autonomous systems in mill yard environments, this study: (1) utilizes a systematic literature review to map current autonomous technologies and algorithms suitable for adoption by the forest industry in automation of vehicles working in mill yards; (2) summarizes and discusses the potential feasibility of the considered sensors, systems and adoption strategies, and considers implementation challenges for high-level autonomous machinery in mill yard environments; and (3) proposes a system framework that integrates multiple technologies to enable autonomous navigation and material handling in mill yards. The study is the first of its kind as a comprehensive study on autonomous vehicles and machinery in mill yard environments. Our novel framework aids in the identification of follow-up research areas and thus promotes the adoption and use of complex autonomous systems in industrial environments.},

  abstract={DevOps (development and operations) is a set of collaborative practices that automate delivery of new software updates with the aim to reduce the development life cycle and produce quality software products. Software organizations face several barriers while adopting DevOps practices as the integration of development and operation teams requires merger of different processes, tools, and skill sets. This study aims to develop a prioritization-based framework of the DevOps best practices based on evidence collected from industry experts. To attain the study aims, firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify DevOps best practices reported in the literature. Next, a questionnaire survey study was conducted to receive insight from industry practitioners for the identified best practice. Finally, the fuzzy-AHP technique was applied to prioritize the best practices concerning to the significance for DevOps process. We believe that the identified best practices, their categorization and fuzzy-AHP based framework will help industry experts to revise and improve their strategies to make the DevOps process sustainable.},

  abstract={Human status detection (HSD) is important to understand the status of users when interacting with various systems under different conditions. Recently, although various machine learning algorithms have been applied to analyze and detect human status, there are no guidelines to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects of human status. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate measures, tools, and machine learning algorithms for HSD by applying a systematic literature review method. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) model to answer three research questions related to the research objective. A total of 76 articles were identified using two hundred keyword combinations addressing topics under HSD in the fields of human factors and human-computer interaction (HCI). The results showed that research on HSD becomes important in industrial systems, focusing on how intelligent systems based on machine learning (ML) differ from earlier generations of automated systems, and what these differences necessarily imply for HCI to design and evaluation. The tools used to collect data for HSD on different parameters are broadly discussed. Recent HSD studies seem to focus on cognitive load and emotion, whereas prior studies have focused on the detection of physical effort. This research assists domain researchers in identifying HSD approaches using different ML algorithms that are suitable for use in their research.},

  year={2020},

  pages={332-337},
  abstract={Software quality prediction is the process of evaluating the software developed for various metrics like defect prediction, bug localisation, effort estimation etc. To evaluate these metrics a myriad of techniques have been developed in the literature, from manual assessment to application of machine learning and statistical testing. These methodologies, however, had lower accuracy in determining SQPMs due to their inability to model the complex relationships in the training data. With the wide emergence of deep learning, not only has the accuracy of the pre-existing models enhanced, but it has also opened doors for new metrics that could be evaluated and automated. This study performs a systematic literature review of research papers published from January 1990 to January 2019 that used deep learning to evaluate software quality prediction metrics (SQPM). The paper identifies 20 primary studies and 7 categories of application of deep learning in SQPM. Models using deep learning techniques significantly outperform other traditional methodologies in almost all studies. The concept and external threats to the models are limited, however the time taken to train these models is large. The techniques, currently predominantly applied for defect prediction, have shown promising results in other diverse software engineering fields like code search and effort estimation by modeling the source code efficiently. There is, hence, scope for incorporating deep learning further with pragmatic use and diverse application. The need to find scalable solutions, however, still persists.},

  abstract={A modern vehicle has a complex internal architecture and is wirelessly connected to the Internet, other vehicles, and the infrastructure. The risk of cyber attacks and other criminal incidents along with recent road accidents caused by autonomous vehicles calls for more research on automotive digital forensics. Failures in automated driving functions can be caused by hardware and software failures and cyber security issues. Thus, it is imperative to be able to determine and investigate the cause of these failures, something which requires trustable data. However, automotive digital forensics is a relatively new field for the automotive where most existing self-monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles only monitor safety-related events. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first systematic literature review on the current research within this field. We identify and assess over 300 papers published between 2006–2021 and further map the relevant papers to different categories based on identified focus areas to give a comprehensive overview of the forensics field and the related research activities. Moreover, we identify forensically relevant data from the literature, link the data to categories, and further map them to required security properties and potential stakeholders. Our categorization makes it easy for practitioners and researchers to quickly find relevant work within a particular sub-field of digital forensics. We believe our contributions can guide digital forensic investigations in automotive and similar areas, such as cyber-physical systems and smart cities, facilitate further research, and serve as a guideline for engineers implementing forensics mechanisms.},

  abstract={Owing to the merits of early safety and reliability guarantee, autonomous driving virtual testing has recently gains increasing attention compared with closed-loop testing in real scenarios. Although the availability and quality of autonomous driving datasets and toolsets are the premise to diagnose the autonomous driving system bottlenecks and improve the system performance, due to the diversity and privacy of the datasets and toolsets, collecting and featuring the perspective and quality of them become not only time-consuming but also increasingly challenging. This paper first proposes a Systematic Literature review approach for Autonomous driving tests (SLA), then presents an overview of existing publicly available datasets and toolsets from 2000 to 2020. Quantitative findings with the scenarios concerned, perspectives and trend inferences and suggestions with 35 automated driving test tool sets and 70 test data sets are also presented. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform such recent empirical survey on both the datasets and toolsets using a SLA based survey approach. Our multifaceted analyses and new findings not only reveal insights that we believe are useful for system designers, practitioners and users, but also can promote more researches on a systematic survey analysis in autonomous driving surveys on dataset and toolsets.},

  abstract={In-company training is facing new challenges in preparing employees for the demands of digitalized and automated manufacturing. New training concepts like microlearning are necessary to support work-process-related learning. To handle the limitations of microlearning, we develop a 360-degree learning system to demonstrate a realistic work environment and overcome the lack of design knowledge supporting the motivation and performance of employees using such systems. Based on a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews, we have developed design requirements for interactive 360-degree learning environments. We used a workshop-based mixed-method approach with interviews, concept maps, and video analysis to evaluate the motivation and performance of precision mechanics within a prototypical work-process-oriented learning environment in an intercompany vocational training center. The results show a positive effect on learning outcomes and motivation. In addition, the ease of use and sense of presence while using the learning environment are rated as high. We contribute to theory by shedding new light on learners’ motivation and performance within work-process-oriented interactive 360-degree learning environments. Furthermore, we offer guidelines for developing interactive 360-degree learning environments against the background of the current metaverse discussion.},

  abstract={In large-scale software development projects, change impact analysis (CIA) plays an important role in controlling software design evolution. Identifying and accessing the effects of software changes using traceability links between various software artifacts is a common practice during the software development cycle. Recently, research in automated traceability-link recovery has received broad attention in the software maintenance community to reduce the manual maintenance cost of trace links by developers. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review related to automatic traceability link recovery approaches with a focus on CIA. We identified 33 relevant studies and investigated the following aspects of CIA: traceability approaches, CIA sets, degrees of evaluation, trace direction and methods for recovering traceability link between artifacts of different types. Our review indicated that few traceability studies focused on designing and testing impact analysis sets, presumably due to the scarcity of datasets. Based on the findings, we urge further industrial case studies. Finally, we suggest developing traceability tools to support fully automatic traceability approaches, such as machine learning and deep learning.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={2425-2437},
  abstract={Transformers have gained popularity in the software engineering (SE) literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input (e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them. Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific downstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence suggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known about the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is just one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the natural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored for the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the model's performance. For example, in the case of code summarization, a tailored pre-training objective could be the identification of an appropriate name for a given method, considering the method name to generate as an extreme summary. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training objectives on the performance of trans-formers when automating code-related tasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the pre-training objectives used in SE. Then, we pre-train 32 transformers using both (i) generic pre-training objectives usually adopted in SE; and (ii) pre-training objectives tailored to specific code-related tasks subject of our experimentation, namely bug-fixing, code summarization, and code completion. We also compare the pre-trained models with non pre-trained ones and show the advantage brought by pre-training in different scenarios, in which more or less fine-tuning data are available. Our results show that: (i) pre-training helps in boosting performance only if the amount of fine-tuning data available is small; (ii) the MLM objective is usually sufficient to maximize the prediction performance of the model, even when comparing it with pre-training objectives specialized for the downstream task at hand.},

  abstract={Smart Logistics (SL) offers a competitive advantage for e-commerce by utilizing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as IoT, AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, 5G, etc. This technology automates, optimizes, and enables real-time tracking and monitoring of shipments, predicts, and prevents delays, and optimizes delivery routes and schedules. It also provides greater visibility and control, allowing e-commerce businesses to react quickly and efficiently to changes in demand or supply. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of digitalization on trade logistics in e-commerce, emphasizing the significance of smart logistics for the e-commerce industry. We reviewed 288 articles published in the last decade in the Scopus database to assess the maturity of research in this area. For researchers, this study provides a better understanding of smart e-commerce logistics and identifies research gaps in the literature. For e-commerce professionals, it can help them adopt the latest technological trends in their logistics. Through a systematic literature review and network analysis approach, the study has contributed by identifying 5 clusters related to ICT application fields in e-commerce and 5 clusters related to important ICT enablers in smart logistics. We also identified several research gaps and areas for future study, including the underutilization of computer vision technology and the need for further research on product quality inspection and accessibility for people with disabilities. Additionally, we suggest exploring the power of deep learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) and optimizing sensing data volume for minimizing costs associated with data storage and transfer. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in smart logistics for e-commerce and serves as a guide for future research in this field.},

  abstract={The broad dissemination and scope of social media enables individuals to exchange information in realtime. This active involvement of societies plays a major role in reducing disaster risk and alleviating at-risk populations. While any operation needs accurate information in crisis management to enable a rapid response to decrease the potential loss of life. Timely retrieval of information from regions of an area affected by disaster is a demanding task. A catastrophe relief and response method's effectiveness depends largely on a prompt and accurate crisis assessment. This knowledge is primarily collected on site by first responders and can be updated later on. Several technics have been builts to automate this need through the extraction and analysis of appropriate content from social media. These approaches are not, however, well incorporated into the mechanism of relief. For more advancement, it would be important to reveal them. The era of big data and analytics is giving crisis management new possibilities (DM). Big data is fundamentally transforming humanitarian operations and crisis management due to its ability to simulate, evaluate, and forecast disasters. However, the related literature is complex and fragmented, necessitating a study in order to determine its progression. Big data and its uses for disaster mitigation have been the subject of many publications. This thesis explores big data in DM based on a systematic literature review to current key contributions, holes, threats, and future research agenda. The results are presented in terms of yearly dissemination, key articles, and-most cited papers in the review. The results also reveal a classifiable pattern.},

  abstract={One of the most crucial and difficult computer vision tasks in textile smart manufacturing is automated quality guarantee of textile fabric materials. The algorithms for detecting flaws in fabric are examined in detail in this survey. To begin, this article provides a brief overview of the significance and inevitable arrival of fabric defect detection in the era of artificial intelligence in manufacturing. Second, there are several different types of algorithms that can be used for defect detection; these include statistical, structural, spectral, and model-based algorithms. There is an existing systematic literature review of these procedures. Finally, this research looks at how algorithms can be used to detect flaws in fabrics. Researchers and engineers in the textile industry can use this paper as a resource for learning more about detecting fabric defects. Using the average of four orientations applied to different textural features present in an image, this study proposes a method using Histogram and HF to determine the appropriate CNN with Active contour Feature for the specific type of defect. Multiple machine learning techniques were used to evaluate the constructed models. Findings from this study indicated that 85 percent of the time, participants correctly identified the relevant CNN with Active contour characteristic associated with a given textile fault in silk fabric. An accuracy of 87% is achieved by the best model generated. When we compared the same models made out of different materials, such as jute, diamond pattern fabric, and flower pattern fabric, we found that the accuracy of the diamond pattern fabric was 86% and the accuracy of the jute model was 79%.},

  abstract={Contribution: A systematic literature review on the empirical evidence regarding the usage of programming languages for learning purposes is presented. The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.},

  abstract={Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is an Agile-based software development methodology becoming increasingly popular in the software development industry due to its ability to automate the software delivery process, reduce the time to market, and enhance software quality. However, despite the growing interest in CI/CD adoption, many organizations have not achieved full success in implementing and utilizing the CI/CD workflow. To address this gap, this study aimed to identify the factors that drive the behavioural intention of IT employees to use the CI/CD workflow: based on the Sri Lankan context. A systematic literature review using the PRISMA framework identified the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology models as the most widely used and accepted models for understanding technology adoption. Therefore, TAM, UTAUT and past literature were used to develop the conceptual framework. The variables in this research model were measured through questionnaires with nominal and five-point Likert scales and close-ended questions, which were completed by the IT employees in Sri Lanka. Data cleaning and demographic data analysis were conducted using IBM SPSS 21, and preliminary data analysis was performed using PLS-SEM (SmartPLS 4). The study found that Performance expectancy is the most significant factor determining IT employees’ behavioural intention to use CI/CD workflow. Therefore, the study concluded that organizations and management should focus more on enhancing employees’ performance expectancy to adopt CI/CD workflow successfully.},

  abstract={The successful use of Business Analytics is increasingly becoming a differentiating competitive factor. The ability to extract data-driven insights and integrate them into decision-making is becoming growingly important. The underlying technologies are evolving exponentially, the value proposition differs from simple descriptive applications to automated decision-making. Existing approaches found in literature and practice to classify those levels only insufficiently mark down the boundaries between the different technology levels. As a consequence, it is often unclear which characteristics of the technology interact with the working environment, which can be described as a socio-technical system. Using a systematic literature review, this paper identifies the characteristics of Business Analytics and delineates three types of Business Analytics based on case studies. Thus, a starting point for the socio-technical system design and optimization for the use of Business Analytics is created.},

  pages={10086-10103},
  abstract={Besides developing new Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) services for the improvement of road safety and travel experience, researchers are considering protection mechanisms to ensure the security of these services and the safety of involved users (drivers but also, e.g., cyclists and pedestrians). In particular, several Identity Management (IDM) protocols have been designed as the first line of defence against external attackers. Among these protocols, a promising trend in research consists in the use of a Smart Card (SC) as a technical enabler for strong authentication. Indeed, many SC-based IDM protocols for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications in real-time CCAM services have been proposed in the literature which present interesting features and promising usability experimental results. However, this research line is far from being exhausted, especially considering the recent spread of SC technologies and use cases. For this reason, in this paper we propose a systematic literature review on SC-based IDM protocols for real-time CCAM services. In particular, we identify characterising assumptions of CCAM scenarios and extrapolate a unified high-level view of the steps composing a SC-based IDM protocol. Then, we present a detailed survey of several SC-based IDM protocols. Finally, we identify trends in research and formulate guidelines and useful recommendations to provide a solid base which researchers can use as a starting point for the design of new and improved SC-based IDM protocols for CCAM scenarios.},

  abstract={In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in various industries, including cybersecurity. However, the same capabilities that make AI effective in protecting systems can also be used by attackers to launch sophisticated and complex cyberattacks. In this paper, the author conducted a systematic literature review to identify recent AI-driven cyberattacks and their characteristics, which could be used by cybersecurity experts to develop effective countermeasures. Preliminary findings indicate that some of the AI-driven attack types include data manipulation attacks (e.g. AI model data misclassification), access and penetration attacks (e.g. automated payload generation), and social engineering attacks (e.g. custom-made phishing). The paper also provides recommendations for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners to promote cybersecurity best practices, educate the public, and encourage international cooperation. Future research could delve deeper into the technical aspects of AI-driven cyberthreats and the strategies and techniques utilised to combat them. Overall, this paper emphasises the growing concern over offensive AI and adversarial AI and the need for continuous research and innovation to combat these evolving smart threats.},

  abstract={The increasing integration of AI software into various aspects of our daily lives has amplified the importance of evaluating the quality of these intelligent systems. The rapid proliferation of AI-based software projects and the growing reliance on these systems underscore the urgency of examining their quality for practical applications in both industry and academia. This systematic literature review delves into the study of quality assessment metrics and methods for AI-based systems, pinpointing key attributes and properties of intelligent software projects that are crucial for determining their quality. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of this domain will enable researchers to devise novel methods and metrics for effectively and efficiently evaluating the quality of such systems. Despite its importance, this area of development is still relatively nascent and evolving. This paper presents a systematic review of the current state of the taxonomy of quality assessment for AI-based software. We analyzed 271 articles from six different sources that focused on the quality assessment of intelligent software systems. The primary objective of this work is to provide an overview of the field and consolidate knowledge, which will aid researchers in identifying additional areas for future research. Moreover, our findings reveal the necessity to establish remedial strategies and develop tools to automate the process of identifying appropriate actions in response to abnormal metric values.},

  volume={},

  pages={1646-1651},
  abstract={Commits represent an essential part of software development practices, serving as the means for collaboration and management of software changes made to a software project’s codebase. Changes are necessary for the survival of software, for instance, to fix faults, address security vulnerabilities, meet new functional requirements, and improve software performance. To aid software research and practice, several research endeavors attempted to automate the process of identifying the nature of the maintenance tasks performed in a commit based on the data associated with the commit. This paper presents a systematic literature review of supervised-learning-based models for commit classification into maintenance activities. Through the study selection process, 19 primary studies were identified, published between 2008 and 2023 in various journals and conference proceedings. For the independent variables for classification, features extracted from commit messages are prevalent, followed by features extracted from source code and commit metadata. In the majority of existing studies, multi-class classification approaches are used, whereas multi-label approaches are considered rarely. The most commonly used classification algorithms include Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Neural Network. Several datasets exist, consisting mainly of commits from different open-source projects based on the Java programming language. Some research gaps and open challenges were identified that can guide future research efforts.},

  abstract={Context: There are several initiatives to semi-automate the initial selection of studies task for Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) to reduce effort and potential bias. Objective: We propose a strategy called SCAS-AI to semi-automate the initial selection task. This strategy improves the original SCAS strategy with Artificial Intelligence (AI) resources (fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm) for studies selection. Method: We evaluated the SCAS-AI strategy through a quasi-experiment with SLRs in Software Engineering (SE). Results: In general, the SCAS-AI strategy improved the results achieved using the original SCAS strategy in reducing the effort of the initial selection task. The effort reduction applying SCAS-AI was 39.1%. In addition, the errors percentage was 0.3% for studies automatically excluded (false negative – loss of evidence) and 3.3% for studies automatically included (false positive – evidence later excluded during the full-text reading). Conclusion: The results show the potential of the investigated AI techniques to support the initial selection task for SLRs in SE.},

  pages={126917-126951},
  abstract={People with hearing impairments are found worldwide; therefore, the development of effective local level sign language recognition (SLR) tools is essential. We conducted a comprehensive review of automated sign language recognition based on machine/deep learning methods and techniques published between 2014 and 2021 and concluded that the current methods require conceptual classification to interpret all available data correctly. Thus, we turned our attention to elements that are common to almost all sign language recognition methodologies. This paper discusses their relative strengths and weaknesses, and we propose a general framework for researchers. This study also indicates that input modalities bear great significance in this field; it appears that recognition based on a combination of data sources, including vision-based and sensor-based channels, is superior to a unimodal analysis. In addition, recent advances have allowed researchers to move from simple recognition of sign language characters and words towards the capacity to translate continuous sign language communication with minimal delay. Many of the presented models are relatively effective for a range of tasks, but none currently possess the necessary generalization potential for commercial deployment. However, the pace of research is encouraging, and further progress is expected if specific difficulties are resolved.},

  abstract={Visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA), though error prone, has long been used for screening women and to guide management for cervical cancer. The automated visual evaluation (AVE) technique, in which deep learning is used to predict precancer based on a digital image of the acetowhitened cervix, has demonstrated its promise as a low-cost method to improve on human performance. However, there are several challenges in moving AVE beyond proof-of-concept and deploying it as a practical adjunct tool in visual screening. One of them is making AVE robust across images captured using different devices. We propose a new deep learning based clustering approach to investigate whether the images taken by three different devices (a common smartphone, a custom smartphone-based handheld device for cervical imaging, and a clinical colposcope equipped with SLR digital camera-based imaging capability) can be well distinguished from each other with respect to the visual appearance/content within their cervix regions. We argue that disparity in visual appearance of a cervix across devices could be a significant confounding factor in training and generalizing AVE performance. Our method consists of four components: cervix region detection, feature extraction, feature encoding, and clustering. Multiple experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and compare alternative methods in each component. Our proposed method achieves high clustering accuracy (97%) and significantly outperforms several representative deep clustering methods on our dataset. The high clustering performance indicates the images taken from these three devices are different with respect to visual appearance. Our results and analysis establish a need for developing a method that minimizes such variance among the images acquired from different devices. It also recognizes the need for large number of training images from different sources for robust device-independent AVE performance worldwide.},

  abstract={Communication among people can happen with the help of verbal or nonverbal language. Nonverbal communication is shared only among the hearing and speech impaired and is not common among others. Non-verbal communication is also different for different countries around the world. A solution to remove the gap between verbal and non-verbal communicators is to create an automated language translation model that can effortlessly convert sign language to text or audio. This area has been under research for a long time, but an economical and robust system that can efficiently convert signs into speech still does not exist. This paper focuses on different approaches that were put forward to turn Indian sign language into audio signals. The Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system is classified as isolated and continuous sign language models based on its input.},
