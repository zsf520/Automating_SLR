  abstract={The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of using AI-based online translation tools in health management education to determine its effect on improving health management education. Several of the current mainstream online translation tools for translating English literature related to health management education have been tested. The knowledge of health management translated by the online translation tool is translated into the mother tongue for the evaluation of the students’ cognitive ability of the relevant knowledge. The online questionnaire was used to provide feedback on students’ understanding and mastery of health management knowledge translated into their native language. The mainstream online translation tools already allow students to translate basic health education materials into their native language. The mainstream translation tools with the assistance of artificial intelligence can achieve high accuracy in the translation of short sentences in health education materials. The results show that the online translation of health education materials from non-native language to native language can basically enable students to obtain the correct understanding of health education materials. Of course, converting long sentences in health education materials into short sentences to improve the accuracy of intelligent translation tools can effectively improve the cognitive effect. Future research could further validate the AI-assisted learning of health education materials in non-native languages.},

  pages={402-405},
  abstract={In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, English learning resources have become more abundant, and the ways for students to obtain English learning resources have become more convenient, which has prompted changes in the traditional teacher-centered English model. More and more higher education institutions and scholars focus on cultivating students' autonomous English learning abilities and advocate a student-oriented English teaching model. This paper designs a college English writing teaching model based on big data technology to highlight the teaching focus of lexical chunks. The research found that big data technology effectively monitors the learning process of students and gives timely feedback on the learning effect. At the same time, the teaching of lexical chunk promotes students' writing input and triggers output, which may innovate English teaching and motivate students' learning motivation. Through the comparison with the study of computational linguistics, it is also found that students' understanding of lexical chunk is basic, and it is reasonable to infer that students can not fully grasp the lexical chunks used in the daily communication in terms of the proper forms and the pragmatic functions, and misusing happens fairly frequently. The study highlights the significance of integrating the teaching mode which involves lexical chunk specifically in English textbooks and lectures for EFL, especially for students with a relatively low language proficiency.},

  abstract={The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications is gaining global attention and promises to revolutionise every aspect of human life, including education. AI will transform higher education (HE) institutions through improved adaptation and competitiveness. The application of AI in HE is an emerging research area with limited review. Our paper seeks to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and visualisation of research on AI application in HE in the past two decades. We evaluated 283 articles published by researchers from 59 countries in the Scopus database over the past two decades based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study applied various bibliometric indicators and word analysis to examine emergent trends. VOSviewer was used for visualisations to map a knowledge base by uncovering keywords used within AI in HE. The results show the number of AI articles published per year, their geographic distribution, analysis by subject area and keywords, and research trends. Research in AI is interdisciplinary, dominated by computer science and engineering fields. AI research in HE is growing, the first 15 years contributed 22%, and the last five years yielded 78%. Countries with a high investment in research dominated AI research, with China and the United States leading. There is very little research from developing countries.

  number={},
  pages={110558-110572},
  abstract={Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.},

  abstract={With data on education becoming more available, it has created a strong link between big data and learning analytics. This link paved the way for researchers in these fields to address several issues within higher education. In this study, we address the inequity in higher education, which is a long standing issue, that is depriving many skilled people of the fundamental right of education due to their background, gender, race, ethnicity or social class. Research has shown that deprived groups in terms of their demographics are more likely to fail. In this regard, we propose to use a deep neural network (DNN) that aims to predict students’ final results. This prior knowledge of students’ outcome could be used in favor of underprivileged groups in order to assist and enhance their chances to be successful. The conceived DNN consists of a binary classifier that is trained on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, with the aim to classify students into two categories: fail or pass, given a specific module and based on their demographics and interaction with the virtual learning environment. The obtained results are promising and show that deep learning could be an effective tool to promote equity in higher education. Moreover, they reveal that this latter is also a powerful tool for exploring big data within learning analytics, provided that deep neural networks become more accurate when they are provided with additional data.},

  abstract={English speaking is a very important skill of English ability for students. At the same time, English speaking learning needs a demanding environment. Because English teachers have heavy teaching tasks and limited time. This research developed an English-speaking teaching system with natural language processing technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms, which can solve this problem very well. The system engages the most advanced natural language processing technology based on artificial intelligence algorithms to correct and feedback students' oral problems in a timely, fast, and targeted manner, which is beneficial to improve students' speaking learning efficiency and interest. This system proposes an improved Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, which is simply called BERT and based on Transformer's bidirectional encoding representation. The accuracy of this algorithm for spoken English recognition is significantly higher than other classical algorithms. This system has been tested and evaluated in some universities, and the learning efficiency and satisfaction of students is significantly higher than other oral English learning systems.},

So, the performance level decreases and reduces their thinking ability as well technology has grown, all the answers are now available in the internet. If they search since the internet, they get their answers directly but without knowing the base from how it came. Therefore, everyone is trying to reach the upcoming technologies without strong in their basics. Hence, a model is created with the help of toolkit (like courseware, etc.) where the technology behind this is AI. This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.},

  abstract={Education is a vital part of the development of society and it is changing over time in terms of methods, content, concepts, and models. Recently, it has been increasingly prevalent to benefit from the potentialities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing educational issues. In this research, the current state of the art of the integration of AI in K-12 education was provided. Specifically, different parts of education in which AI was employed along with the related AI categories were discussed according to different K-12 grades and courses. Additionally, technologies and environments that contributed to employing AI in education were discussed. To this end, a systematic literature review was conducted on articles and conference papers published between 2011 and 2021 in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. As the result of the initial search, 2075 documents were extracted and based on inclusive criteria and 210 documents were identified for further investigation. AI applications were categorized into Student performance, Teaching, Selection, and Behavior tasks, and Other. Machine Learning (ML) and Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) were the most common approaches among AI categories. Furthermore, high school-related applications were more frequent and STEM courses were substantially targeted by AI. In conclusion, the remarkable impact of AI on education was concluded. The current study reveals information about the potentialities offered by AI in K-12 education which aids researchers in implementing AI-based education systems. As for future works, other databases such as ACM library and Google Scholar can be investigated as well. Furthermore, exploring the 95 papers that were excluded due to inaccessibility to their full texts can be taken into account. Finally, the papers can be also investigated in terms of pedagogical approaches or development tools.},

  abstract={To meet expectations of stakeholders in Education 4.0, the inclination towards acceptance, testing, and implementation of Voice Assistants has increased at a faster pace in western universities. This study has been done to understand the present level of performance and capability of voice assistants in answering the basic queries of users from Indian Higher education sector. Three voice assistants namely Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, and Google Assistant have been considered for a survey in which 100 students participated and tested the performance of these three voice assistants by asking basic questions related to admission and examination. A set of total 14 questions has been selected to be asked by user in both the categories. Category 1 related to Admissions contained 7 little complex questions while category 2 related to Examination had 7 direct and simpler questions. Responses of the users were noted down and after careful analysis, the explanations have been deduced about performance of these voice assistants in factors considered: understanding of voice and language of user, understanding of basic meaning of the question, request to repeat the question, whether the answer was given by voice assistants and quality of the answer received. As per the results, various observations have been noted that may further help Artificial Intelligence developers and programmers to understand the success and failure of voice assistants and accordingly bring improvements in their performance level. This study also helps in knowing about huge applications, contributions and benefits these voice assistants offer to the stakeholders. Once the improvements are incorporated by the developers, marketing professionals can boost the absorption and use of voice assistants in massive higher education sector of India by convincing the important stakeholders that also paves a way to tap into more undiscovered possibilities about use of Artificial Intelligence in higher education system at global level.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a new feature of the OJ system at Donghua University: intelligent training. Compared to other OJ systems, our OJ has the following features: 1) A clustering algorithm is used to classify the problems. When a student completes a category of problems, he or she passes a level and is awarded the corresponding score. 2) The system intelligently determines whether a student can pass the level or not. Generally, students with higher abilities need to complete fewer problems but receive higher scores. 3) The system uses a classification algorithm to determine whether plagiarism has occurred based on the code submitted by the student and the behavioral characteristics of the student at the time of submission, thus preventing plagiarism as much as possible. 4) The system uses a BP neural network to predict students' final exam scores, and then uses that predicted value as a point for reflecting ability to enhance students' sense of achievement in completing the practices. The OJ intelligent training model, based on the above features, allows students to train themselves at different levels according to their ability. Weaker students can practice more at lower levels to strengthen their foundation, while stronger students can practice more at higher levels to compete in competitions. This achieves the goal of personalized teaching at different levels and achieves better teaching results.},

  abstract={For many pupils, learning mathematics has been a significant problem. The growth of computer technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), offers a solution to this problem by detecting individual students' learning challenges and giving individualized support to help them perform better in mathematics classes. However, there is a dearth of evaluations from a variety of viewpoints to assist researchers, particularly novices, in gaining a comprehensive understanding of AI research in mathematics education. To that end, this study will conduct a bibliometric mapping analysis and systematic review to investigate the role and research trends of AI in mathematics education by searching the Web of Science (WOS) database for relevant articles published in high-quality journals indexed by the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Furthermore, by referring to the technology-based learning model, several aspects of AI in mathematics education research are taken into account, including application domains, participants, research methods, adopted technologies, research issues and AI roles, as well as citation and co-citation relationships. As a result, progress in AI research in mathematics education is presented, and possible study subjects for future research are suggested.},
