abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science [84]. The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article shares the insights from both students and lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in teaching and learning of these topics.},

abstract = {Based on the principle of dialectic symmetry formulated by the philosophy of dialectic positivism, an interpretation of the concept of "artificial intelligence" is proposed. This principle assumes the existence of a hierarchy of information objects, similar to the hierarchy, which reflects different levels of organization of matter (mechanical, chemical, biological, social). The construction of a hierarchy of information objects - information processing systems - allows us to interpret in the same way the essence of both artificial intelligence and the intelligence that a human being is endowed with. These are information processing systems referring to the highest levels of the specified hierarchy.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the vigorous development of China's economy, society and culture, ideological and political education and mental health education in colleges and universities are facing new challenges. Simple ideological and political education is no longer suitable for the development of young people. In the reality of education, due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of ideological and political work, and do not have the relevant psychological knowledge, many educators treat all problems, especially psychological problems as ideological and political problems, which will have a negative impact on the growth of young people. Therefore, we need to strengthen the effectiveness of ideological and political education, make ideological and political education more scientific, predictable and targeted. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of psychology in higher education. This paper first expounds the concept of psychology, and then introduces the application value of psychology in college education and teaching. This paper takes teachers from four colleges and universities in Sichuan province as the research object, uses questionnaire survey method, and makes statistics on 178 questionnaires. The analysis results show that 62% of the teachers realize the importance of psychology to education work.},

abstract = {An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. Studies in the U.S. report that average six-year graduation rates across higher-education institutions is 59% and have remained relatively stable over the last 15 years. For those that do complete a college degree, less than half complete within four-years. Requiring additional terms or leaving college without receiving a bachelor's degree has high human and monetary costs and deprives students from the economic benefits of a college credential (over $1 million in a lifetime and even higher in STEM fields). Moreover, when students do not succeed in graduating, local and national communities struggle to create an educated workforce. Estimates indicate that by 2020 over 64% of the jobs in the U.S. will require at least some post-secondary education. These challenges have been recognized by the U.S. National Research Council, which identified that there is a critical need to develop innovative approaches to enable higher-education institutions retain students, ensure their timely graduation, and are well-trained and workforce ready in their field of study. Failure to do so represents a significant problem as it deprives the U.S. of the highly skilled workforce that it needs to successfully compete in the modern world.This talk describes various efforts under way to develop "Big Data" methods to analyze in a comprehensive manner, the large and diverse types of education and learning-related data in order to improve undergraduate education. These methods are motivated by and are designed to address various interrelated issues that have a significant impact on college student success and include: (i) academic pathways towards successful and timely graduation from the student perspective; (ii) effective pedagogy by instructors; and (iii) retention and persistence of students from the institutional and advisor perspective. In addition, the talk will discuss areas in which research methods and approaches originally developed by the recommender systems community can be applied to this domain.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which "intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity" [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.},

We formalized such relationships as a set of specific processes that we used in the created simulation case study. We consider the simulation models created within the case study as a tool to support higher education institution sustainability. In the simulation case study, we analyzed the faculty-students relationship described by the related institution admission processes. The simulation case study is connected with economic-constituent relations sustainability metrics. The simulation case study has been applied at a young fast growing higher education institution in the United States.},

The mention of the word AI fills the imaginations of many with thoughts of talking robots, jobs being replaced, and possibly even the destruction of mankind. Perhaps imaginations are running wild due to, perhaps driven by the loose definition of AI as systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence that allows Hollywood to take some creative license. The experts in the field tend to work directly with AI and often for large companies, allowing for the imagination and news headlines to be where the public gets their information. Many wonder if this new technology is going to be an overall benefit to society or if it will bring unmitigated disaster. When the imagination runs wild, instead of understanding, news stories can perpetuate concerns and anxieties rather than hope and optimism.},

abstract = {With rapid development in the IT world, technologies are becoming more dynamic and advanced. Today, technologies are changing with customer requirements. In the IT world, research is carried out to make technology better to meet the requirements that change with time. With the advancement in the IT world, online services have proliferated. Now a days, cloud computing is the hottest buzzword in the IT world. Cloud computing is not limited to the E-Governance and business worlds, but is also making a great impact in the education world. With growing demand for education, technologies and research, all universities and education institutions have their eyes on cloud computing. The main pillars of educational institutions are students, faculties, administrations and libraries. Faculty and students do research and need quality data while students of a particular field need a subject-oriented knowledge. Manually getting these kinds of data is time consuming as students depend on literature, books, different kind of software and hardware. With cloud computing in higher education, cost-effective measures can be taken to minimize the dependency on books, hardware and software. In this paper, we discuss how Artifical Intelligence based cloud computing in higher education will improve quality and ease the process of getting e-resources (software/hardware platform, storage etc.). This study will help in understanding effective cost-cutting measures. We also discuss how cloud computing in the library and administration will brighten the education prospects.},

Secondly, the same respondents were asked to give their opinion on the desired qualities of (explainable) artificial intelligence (AI) legal decision system and to present their general understanding of the term XAI.

abstract = {In the decade since 2010, successes in artificial intelligence have been at the forefront of computer science and technology, and vector space models have solidified a position at the forefront of artificial intelligence. At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way.},

Through these interviews, we identify and discuss key issues in the infusion of AI into cities. These interviewees were key players in their respective cities’ response to the challenge and opportunity of novel technologies, including AI. As such, while our sampling is small, these interviewees are a good representation of the relevant individuals who hold sway over the thoughts, visions, ideas and challenges that are recognized in their respective organizations. We ask, how do these individuals understand AI and gauged through their views, how are these cities prepared for the increasing and continuous infusion of artificial intelligence technologies in these cities’ agendas, practices and projects?},

Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.},

abstract = {Esports has generated an industry of increasing economic and cultural importance. In recent years, universities and other higher education institutions have responded to its growth by establishing programmes of study which aim to satisfy the needs of innovators operating in the area. However, there is not yet consensus on what an esports curriculum should include. Despite being a technology-driven sector with ethical and professional dimensions that intersect computing, current ACM and IEEE curricula do not mention esports. Furthermore, existing courses tend to provide teaching and training on a wide variety of topics aside from those traditionally in computer science. These include: live events management; psychological research; sports science; marketing; public relations; video (livestream) production; and community management; in addition to coaching and communication. This working group examined the requirements for developing esports studies at universities with a focus on understanding career prospects in esports and on the challenges presented by its interdisciplinary complexity. Thereby, paving the way for a framework to support the design of esports curricula in higher education.},

abstract = {Students who progress to higher education from further education colleges are faced with academic, social, and logistical challenges during their transition. In general, they find university life more challenging compared to students who have been at university for two years already. The Associate Student Project (ASP) is an intervention programme within the School of Computing that provides support to students who make this transition. This support includes access to online resources, orientation events, university lectures and workshops, throughout their two years at further education college. This study aims to measure the impact of the ASP through a survey on academic behavioural confidence and a comparison of the grade point average of three student groups: independent direct entrants (n=53), associate students (n=27), and native students (students who entered university at first year, n=75). Analysis revealed that, while independent direct entrants (IDE) were less confident about their studies than native students (NS), there was a closer parity of confidence between native and associate students (AS). In addition, AS' confidence on tasks that relate to requesting information is higher than the other groups, perhaps due to the ASP's emphasis on providing good information to AS and encouraging dialogue. Associate students found interventions that provide insight into university life prior to their transfer useful. Additionally, the grade point average of AS was not found to be significantly different in comparison to native students. This paper reports on the success of these interventions in building student confidence and explores the impact for transitional students.},

In this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes.},

We find that first-price auctions with no additional feedback lead to tacit-collusive outcomes (bids lower than values), while second-price auctions do not. We show that the difference is driven by the incentive in first-price auctions to outbid opponents by just one bid increment. This facilitates re-coordination on low bids after a phase of experimentation. We also show that providing information about the lowest bid to win, as introduced by Google at the time of the switch to first-price auctions, increases competitiveness of auctions.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI. Finally, we present a holistic view of the recent advancements in trustworthy AI to help the interested researchers grasp the crucial facets of the topic efficiently and offer possible future research directions.},

This paper illustrates findings from an empirical study with the purpose of familiarizing two classes of 11-12-year-old children (N=37) with central concepts related to AI, using existing material with modifications. During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.},

We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.},

abstract = {Countries around the globe have acknowledged the pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives and the importance of educating our students on how AI technologies work. For example, the Chinese education ministry has integrated AI into the mandatory high school curriculum, including a pilot textbook to teach students about the fundamental AI technologies like deep learning and recognition. However, there are fewer examples of AI education at the primary level, and these are typically focused on decision-making, machine learning, and programming. We have recently started to develop our own elementary AI curriculum. To develop the curriculum, we first needed to explore what students already knew about AI. Although there are a few small studies on how primary students conceptualize AI, we conducted a study to examine how 10 nine- and ten-year-old students conceptualized artificial intelligence by focusing on two main questions: (1) How do elementary students conceptualize artificial intelligence? (2) What are elementary students' experiences with artificial intelligence? Students? definitions of AI tended to focus on programming and robotics. Students described examples of AI that included robotic vacuums, Siri/Alexa, YouTube, and search engines. They also showcased some misconceptions around AI designs and implementations.},

abstract = {Academic advising is limited in its ability to assist students in identifying academic pathways. Selecting a major and a university is a challenging process rife with anxiety. Students at high school are not sure how to match their interests with their working future or major. Therefore, high school students need guidance and support. Moreover, students need to filter, prioritize and efficiently get appropriate information from the web in order to solve the problem of information overload. This paper represents an approach for developing ontology-based recommender system improved with machine learning techniques to orient students in higher education. The proposed recommender system is an assessment tool for students' vocational strengths and weaknesses, interests and capabilities. The main objective of our ontology-based recommender system is to identify the student requirements, interests, preferences and capabilities to recommend the appropriate major and university for each one.},

abstract = {With the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, the combination of AI with financial technology (FinTech) has become a development trend in the financial industry. However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are more and more integrated into everyday lives, both scholarly and popular discourses on AI's often revolve around charting the various risks that may be associated with them. The manner and magnitude of risk that various researchers identify and foresee varies; however, what is common between them is, undoubtedly, the concept of risk itself. This concept, we argue, has been largely taken for granted by the fields involved in the research on AI's; in other words, "risk" has been employed with an everyday sensibility without due critical examination. In this paper, we address risk as a concept directly, by examining interdisciplinary theories and literatures on risk to discuss examples of AI technologies. Through this work, we aim to begin a critical discussion of the importance of theorising risk within design research and practice, and within the development of emerging technologies.},

This study identified the dominant topics and frames, as well as the risks and benefits of AI covered in five major American newspapers from 2009 to 2018. Results indicated that business and technology were the primary topics in news coverage of AI. The benefits of AI were discussed more frequently than its risks, but risks of AI were generally discussed with greater specificity. Additionally, episodic issue framing and societal impact framing were more frequently used.},

abstract = {In Spain, the majority of university students are women, but the gender distribution in different fields of study is uneven and there are certain disciplines, as engineering and some experimental sciences where less than 30% are women. This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies. In this document we analyze the degree of introduction of the gender perspective in the AI grades and how to improve the gender competences of the students},

abstract = {Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of student-related datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework.},

As AI increasingly drives consequential social decision-making, we must consider not only what can be done but what ought to be done. Grappling with the inherently normative nature of these problems requires an orientation towards AI that is able to conceptualize justice beyond utility.},

Moreover, it is increasingly becoming a national strategy for its rapid development and broad application in industries. However, the way artificial intelligence advances itself is sorely lacking until now. One of the most important reasons is the deficiency of timely and reliable knowledge graph in this field. To illustrate the problem, we introduce an academic knowledge graph of AI, named AI 2000, which combines techniques in data mining, bibliometrics, natural language processing, etc. In this work, we try to link the entities of scholars, academic papers, researches, etc. in the field of artificial intelligence. AI 2000 aims at serving as a medium for us to explore the evolution of artificial intelligence in the past decade and looking forward to its future trend.

abstract = {In recent years, with rapid technological advancement in both computing hardware and algorithm, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant advantage over human being in a wide range of fields, such as image recognition, education, autonomous vehicles, finance, and medical diagnosis. However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.},

It promotes the progress of society and the development of science and technology, and also increases the unemployment rate and the ethical dilemma of technology. The weakness of artificial intelligence lies in the lack of creativity. If human beings want to have core competitiveness in the era of artificial intelligence, they must change education and enhance creativity. Education reform should be carried out from three aspects: one is to cultivate scientific and technological literacy; two is to cultivate data literacy; three is to cultivate humanistic quality.},

In the last decade, expert and learning systems have been widely applied to a plethora of tasks that were considered, in the past, as solvable only by a human. And on top of that, machines are becoming more reliable and accurate than human experts.However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it. In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains.},

The aim of this work is to contribute with information about the feelings generated in university students and to know the main characteristics of Higher Education in Ecuador in times of pandemic. Specifically, the question What are the feelings of university students in times of the COVID-19? was answered. For this purpose, a quantitative, transversal and non-experimental research was carried out. Fifty-five unstructured anonymous interviews were conducted. It was applied to students from 16 Higher Education Institutions. Feelings were analyzed using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and through the computer programs MATLAB and NVIVO applied to the 500 phrases, obtained from 55 interviews with an average of 47 words per phrase. When carrying out the sentiment analysis, it was obtained that approximately 64% was negative, 11% neutral and 25% positive. LDA found that the 55 interviews were explained by 2 unobserved groups represented by the word clouds of topics 7 and 14. The unobserved groups show feelings such as stress, tiredness, problems and effort that may be related to the words people, evaluation, type, education and strength. This research can be complemented with a study that allows to deepen the type of negative, neutral and positive feelings and to determine their possible causes.},

Existing applications of artificial intelligence technology in RTS games are not yet able to compete with professional human players. But there are already ways to control the macro of RTS games, and they can compete with amateur human players. RTS games are an excellent platform for testing artificial intelligence technology, and more and more smarter methods are being used in the overall control of it. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review the artificial intelligence technologies used in RTS games in recent years, including the definition of RTS games, the challenges faced, the platform for research problems, and the artificial intelligence methods for problem solving. Finally, we propose the future research direction of real-time strategy games.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervading the government and transforming how public services are provided to consumers---from allocation of benefits to law enforcement, risk monitoring and the provision of services. Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI's failures? In thirteen preregistered studies (N = 3,724), we document a robust effect of algorithmic transference: algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans---as outgroups characterized by greater homogeneity than ingroups of comparable humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm at a higher rate than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Assessing AI's impact on consumers and societies, we show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may engender algorithmic transference and undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize.},

abstract = {The development of education informatization is crucial to improve the quality of higher education and promote the innovation of education, thus to cultivate innovative talents that meet the requirements of the modern information society. However, the current education informatization construction still faces problems such as insufficient top-level design, unconnected data sharing, and risks of privacy leakage. To this end, this article combines the emerging blockchain technology to discuss the positive function of blockchain in the establishment of education informatization, the possible opportunities for education informatization in the future, and some important challenges that will be faced. Specifically, from the perspective of higher education information system, we analyze the crucial issues in the current information system architecture including postgraduate training, teaching management, supervisor management, project information management, etc., and present the security and scalability issues of the system. On this basis, we propose the potential solutions based on blockchain and analyze the positive effects brought by blockchain technology in terms of security protection and data sharing. Finally, we summarize several major future issues that still need to be overcome in the convergence of blockchain and informatization of higher education.},

To make well-informed and trustworthy decisions based on these models, people require explanations that indicate how to interpret the model outcomes. This paper presents our ongoing research in explainable AI, which investigates how visual analytics interfaces and visual explanations, tailored to the target audience and application domain, can make AI models more transparent and allow interactive steering based on domain expertise. First, we present our research questions and methods, contextualised by related work at the intersection of AI, human-computer interaction, and information visualisation.

More and more users like to take photos or screenshots through smart phones to save and share their life information. Subsequently, using computer to recognize and process image information becomes more and more important. Image recognition technology is an important research field of artificial intelligence. This technology can enable computers to process a large amount of information instead of human beings, so as to free human beings from cumbersome workload. Image recognition technology [3-5] meets the relevant needs of actual users through the steps of relevant information acquisition, preprocessing and model training. Image recognition technology first defines the characteristics of related objects, then memory image matching, and finally image recognition. For the definition of the features of related objects, we can not only use the predefined features, but also train the related features through convolutional neural network.},

The rapid development of social media has recently led to several methodologies and frameworks facilitating competitor analysis through online reviews. Existing studies only focused on detecting comparative sentences in review comments or utilized low-performance models. However, this study proposes a novel approach to identifying the competitive factors using a recent explainable artificial intelligence approach at the comprehensive product feature level. We establish a model to classify the review comments for each corresponding product and evaluate the relevance of each keyword in such comments during the classification process. We then extract and prioritize the keywords and determine their competitiveness based on relevance. Our experiment results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the competitive factors both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

In this context, team developers play a primary role in managing cyber security, risk assessment, and all phases of software application development (concept phases, product development, cyber security validation, production, operations, and maintenance). Currently, only generic standards exist and they are difficult to put into operation due to the lack of the required skills and knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents a vision model based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence that supports developers' decisions to integrate concrete design methods in the automotive development life-cycle. Organizations need to develop their process for developing vehicle components that comply with the new automotive standards.

Although the domain of AI has seen substantial improvements over recent years, its effectiveness is limited by the capabilities of current computing technology. Recently, there have been several architectural innovations for AI using emerging nanotechnology. These architectures implement mathematical computations of AI with circuits that utilize physical behavior of nanodevices purpose-built for such computations. This approach leads to a much greater efficiency vs. software algorithms running on von Neumann processors or CMOS architectures, which emulate the operations with transistor circuits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these architectural directions and categorize them based on their contributions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential offered by these directions with real-world examples. We also discuss major challenges and opportunities in this field.},

abstract = {Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of "AI" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.},

abstract = {The 2019 Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan highlighted the mutual needs and benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. AI techniques are expected to enhance cybersecurity by assisting human system managers with automated monitoring, analysis, and responses to cybersecurity attacks. Conversely, it is essential to guard AI technologies from unintended uses and hostile exploitation by leveraging cybersecurity practices. Research results at the intersection of AI and cybersecurity can help us to be better equipped with tools and techniques to tackle the growing cybersecurity challenges, while also presenting an opportunity to devise fundamentally new ways to motivate and educate students about cybersecurity in the age of AI. Likewise, a June 2019 technical workshop on 'Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity: Opportunities and Challenges' noted how the interplay between AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity will continue to introduce new opportunities and challenges in the security of AI as well as AI for cybersecurity. Basic research at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and education has the potential to expand existing AI opportunities and resources in cybersecurity education and workforce development. Education efforts are needed to foster workforce knowledge and skills about applying AI expertise to cybersecurity as well as building robust and trustworthy AI. This BOF session will bring together researchers who are interested in these collaborative explorations.},

abstract = {Graduation rates are an essential metric for universities to gauge the effectiveness of their programmes. Prediction models can be used to assess students' likelihood of completing their degrees, as well as to analyse the rate of completion of programmes that they offer.Several studies have been done previously using predictive models in various universities around the world. At King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB), Prachuabsupakij and Wuttikamolchai developed a web application that used the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict student's graduation. Other studies made use of other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, neural network and classification and regression tree algorithms. These studies achieved a successful prediction rate of an average of above 70% accuracy.The University of Namibia does not have any predictive models of any kind and neither has any study of this nature ever been done. It was for this reason that this study was conducted using the School of Computing as the case study. The study would then develop a graduates' prediction system for the school of computing.The system is a web-based application that requires a user to log in before accessing its features, such as displaying the predicted outcomes. A sample of 500 student data was used to create the student dataset. The prediction was done using four different prediction models which were then comparatively analysed. Those prediction models are Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest.The web-based application consists of an interactive dashboard to allow the user to visualize the prediction results which can be view using different types of charts all to the user's convenience.This study managed to attain its main object of creating a student graduation prediction system for the school of computing and the sub-objective were also met. The predictions of this study were purely based on the students' academic results in the form of credit scores and other factors were not considered. This study recommends that further research should be done with actual student data from the university's student database records that stretches for over a longer period, say about 5 to 10 years.},

With the rapid development of sensor technology, artificial intelligence technology and the Internet, various modalities of sensor data are emerging rapidly, for example, vision sensors and voice sensors are widely used in target detection and speech interaction. Integrating multiple-modality sensor data could obtain more comprehensive and accurate information, and also enhance the reliability and fault tolerance of the system. Clarifying the principles and mechanisms of how human brain integrates multi-sensory information can provide a theoretical basis for the scientific development of artificial intelligence. The introduction of multi-modality integration modules in artificial intelligence can simulate human perception largely, thus artificial intelligence will be infinitely similar to human intelligence.},

abstract = {Competency-based learning assessment has recently undergone an important development in the field of education. Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student. In fact, it allows a judicious evaluation which follows the enormous progress by adopting an automated method which takes into account the competence level of each pupil.},

abstract = {This paper presents objective metrics for how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be quantified. Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.},

The research shows that the coupling and coordination degree of artificial intelligence to the commercial sports industry is mainly divided into three levels: the type of imbalance in the recession, the type of sub state coordination and the type of coordination in the rising period. The coupling between artificial intelligence system and the commercial sports industry is not a simple process. It needs to completely deduce all links, such as the coupling of intelligent technology innovation, the coupling of intelligent new products in the industrial chain, the coupling of intelligent policy network collaborative subjects, and the coupling of the market, The ultimate goal is to realize the coupling route of artificial intelligence system + large-scale operational sports industry.},

abstract = {Video-based learning (VBL) is widespread; however, there are numerous challenges when teaching and learning with video. For instructors, creating effective instructional videos takes considerable time and effort. For students, watching videos can be a passive learning activity. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the VBL experience for students and teachers. This half-day workshop will bring together multi-disciplinary researchers and practitioners to collaboratively envision the future of VBL enhanced by AI. This workshop will be comprised of a group discussion followed by a presentation session. The goal of the workshop is to facilitate the cross-pollination of design ideas and critical assessments of AI approaches to VBL.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machine's ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language. Awareness of this research and incorporating it into approaches to machine learning from text would help prevent the generation of biased algorithms. Leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence are also primarily female, suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it. Gender balance in machine learning is therefore crucial to prevent algorithms from perpetuating gender ideologies that disadvantage women.},

abstract = {After the birth of human beings, biological evolution essentially ceased. Since then, the evolution of human civilization has been initiated, with curiosity driving science and the desire for control driving technology. The development of science and technology has unfolded in two dimensions of outward and inward, the outward from the solar system, the galaxy to the universe; the inward pointing to human itself, from the movement of life to the movement of consciousness, giving rise to artificial intelligence (AI). For the first time, the "human-like" nature of AI has shaken the social activity in which the world is the stage and humans are the main actors, leading to the ethical issues of AI, of course, including the ethical issues of AI in education(AIEd). The ethical issue of AIEd is the problem caused by the transformation of the actors by implanting humanoids into the human educational community. The main issues include the ethical problem of AI, the adaption of new human and new norms of human behaviors, and the stage for the activities of the actors—the field of AIEd. The regulations of ethical issues of AIEd should aim at the pursuit of human well-being and focus on practice, mainly from the aspects of customs transfer, norms construction and legislation constraints.},

abstract = {Machine maintenance is a major part of total operating costs for manufacturing and production plants, hence, having a cost-effective maintenance strategy is key to success. Most standard solutions operate on a time-driven approach where repairs or replacements are carried out after a given amount of time. This results in healthy machines being replaced unnecessarily incurring losses in both time, resource, and parts. Predictive maintenance utilises sensors capable of collecting real-time operating data and analytical techniques to predict when a machine will require maintenance. This research develops a vibration analysis tool that can detect and differentiate a machines operating conditions without any human analysis or intervention demonstrated via a case study. By using spectrograms in conjunction with image recognition and unsupervised learning, the tool is capable of being applied to many different machines without modification. Results show that features extracted using convolutional auto-encoding and t-SNE, are capable of being clustered in an unsupervised manner accurately based on case study test conditions. Future work looks at the application of this tool into a real-time data stream that can determine operating conditions in real-time.},

abstract = {In the future of India lies the future of a sixth of the world's population. As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog traditional hurdles such as poor infrastructure and bureaucracy. At the same time, an investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society: it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage. In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for AI in India. We detail opportunities that are cross-cutting (bridging India's linguistic divisions, mining public data), and also specific to one particular sector (healthcare). We list challenges that originate from existing social conditions (such as equations of caste and gender). Thereafter we distill out concrete steps and safeguards, which we believe are necessary for robust and inclusive development as India enters the AI era.},

The investigation found that the application of artificial intelligence in Chinese news media started late and lacked intelligence. The development of artificial intelligence was restricted due to the limitation of Chinese language and the inconsistency of technical standards. However, the Chinese news media has high acceptance of artificial intelligence, and has also creatively developed news products such as AI virtual anchor, which will develop rapidly in the future under the push of policy and market in the news field.},

abstract = {Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply inadequate.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions are at this stage, on the one hand, faced with challenges never seen before and, on the other hand, their action is moving very rapidly into digital learning spaces. These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics? As a response to the question raised in this paper is presented an extension of a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools, with the main focus on the stakeholder governance.},

Established human centric concepts will not be able to handle the instream of un- or semi-structured material or handle analogue documentation. We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study. For this an artificial neural network / convolutional neural network was trained and tested on a collection of historical photographs.},

abstract = {Nowadays, distance higher education has rapidly increased due to advance and integration of information and communications' technology. Students who attend online distance courses have often family obligations and job commitments and are usually in 'high risk' of dropout during their attendance. It is of a highly importance to identify such students, through paying extra attention and support to them could possibly minimize the possibility of student failure or even dropout. The present research intends to study whether semi-supervised techniques could be useful in student dropout prediction in distance higher education. Semi-supervised learning aims to generate reliable predictions using few labeled and many unlabeled data. Labeled data are difficult obtainable quite often, as they require many experts, a lot of human effort and time in experiments. As far as, we are aware in several studies propose and compare supervised methods for students' dropout prediction rates in higher education, but none of them investigates the effectiveness of semi-supervised methods. The results of our experiments reveal that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved using few labeled data in comparison to well known supervised learning algorithms. For that purpose we have developed a web-based tool to estimate if an individual student is going to dropout.},

The technology has the potential to provide personalised service to a range of consumers. However, the use of chatbots within educational settings is still limited. In this paper, we present three chatbot prototypes, the Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, are currently developing, and discuss the potential opportunities and technical challenges we face when considering AI chatbots to support our daily activities within the department. Three AI virtual agents are under development: 1) to support the delivery of a taught Master's course simulation game; 2) to support the training and use of a newly introduced educational application; 3) to improve the processing of helpdesk requests within a university department. We hope this paper is informative to those interested in using chatbots in the educational domain. We also aim to improve awareness among those within the chatbot development industry, in particular the chatbot engine providers, about the educational and operational needs within educational institutes, which may differ from those in other domains.},

With the rapid development of multimedia technology, communication technology and network technology, the application of modern information technology in higher education has become more and more extensive. The development, update and application of modern information technology is bound to break the traditional teaching model with teachers as the center and as the main body, so that the role of teachers will be transformed from crammer to leader of learning. Modern information technology has become an important tool for teachers to help students learn. It is not limited by time and space, and provides convenient conditions for students' selective learning and teachers' contact with actual teaching. It is an inevitable trend of education development to promote the modernization of education with information technology and use information technology to change the traditional education model. This paper analyzes the role of modern information technology in higher education teaching, and gives prospects and suggestions on how to better use information technology to carry out education and teaching.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in service-oriented businesses in the form of chatbots. A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.},

abstract = {As a new technological revolution, the artificial intelligence and blockchain technology have greatly changed the ecosystem in economics, finance, society, and culture. Blockchain technology affects people's production, life, and collaboration methods. Higher vocational education is bound to stand the double test of opportunities and challenges brought by the era of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence provides platform support for the injection of endogenous power and intelligent transformation for vocational education reform and innovation. Artificial intelligence technology provides practical momentum in raising the specifications of vocational education personnel training. The development, promotion and application of blockchain technology will definitely change the external development of higher vocational education and surroundings. Therefore, higher vocational colleges should consider the situation: artificial intelligence technology can decisively break the vocational education development model under the traditional format, and blockchain technology seizes the opportunity to achieve leapfrog development. Intelligent vocational education takes advantage of the trend to develop an effective path to form a benign development pattern.},

Employees can meet many of the requirements of their field of work by meeting their requirements, and can follow their carrier conditions. It can be monitored by the camera and saved to the external memory, because of this situation it can be controlled by the FPGA controller. Can monitor their performance, health, skill development and their training time. This process involves input that can pass through the camera in the form of video. The output can be visualized by a computer system; this process can continue to run until the goal is achieved. The field programmable gate array (FPGA) contains artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms. The existing algorithms are the support vector machine algorithm (SVM) and the convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN) algorithm. By using this algorithm, the efficiency can be achieved a lot, and the process can be very easy.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are particularly successful in this domain, with the added benefit of having fairly well established biological foundations. To improve how artificial intelligence research and the cognitive sciences can inform each other, we argue the StarCraft II Learning Environment is an ideal candidate for an environment where humans and artificial agents can be tested on the same tasks. We present an upcoming study using this environment, where the goal is to investigate how RL can be extended to enable abstract human abilities such as moments of insight. We claim this is valuable for advancing our understanding of both artificial and natural intelligence, thereby leading to improved models of player behaviour and for general video game playing.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence nowadays is an intriguing medium for the new generation of contemporary artists. They are many approaches to the utilization of AI as creative media. Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis. Consequently, we aim to raise some of the fundamental questions about artificial intelligence's impact on future human-AI society. This paper will present the two artworks, "Robosophy Philosophy" and "Botorikko, Machine Created State", which are part of the Syntropic Counterpoints ongoing art-based research project. The key novelty in these installations is the use of artificial intelligence - artificial intelligence interaction and universal but abstract human knowledge to investigate AI creative and mindful potentials.},

abstract = {Research has been advancing on the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administrations. However, there is limited consensus and agreement on what is considered Artificial Intelligence, as different understandings and approaches in research and practice exist. This paper explores and compares the varying ways AI has been described and understood in previous Information Systems and eGovernment research. Following, a survey amongst Belgium civil servants is analysed to assess what they associate with the term Artificial Intelligence. The findings show that many civil servants tend to associate AI with being able to conduct intelligent tasks, have certain capabilities or are specific applications they are familiar with. Specific algorithms or learning methods, often included in research papers, are not associated with the term AI. These results show that researchers and policymakers may have opposite or even paradoxical views on what is or is not AI, which could have significant consequences for researching the adoption of AI in government, as well as comparing different research findings. In this respect, the paper proposes to use an integrative lens to study AI in government, by including different dimensions and understandings.},

If AI can assist with these big decisions, we might think it can also help with hard choices, cases where alternatives are neither better, worse nor equal but on a par. The aim of this paper, however, is to show that this view is mistaken: the fact of parity shows that there are hard limits on AI in decision making and choices that AI cannot, and should not, resolve.},

abstract = {Neuroscience explanations-even when completely irrelevant-have been shown to exert a "seductive allure" on individuals, leading them to judge bad explanations or arguments more favorably. There seems to be a similarly seductive allure for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, leading people to "overtrust" these systems, even when they have just witnessed the system perform poorly. The AI-powered neurotechnologies that have begun to proliferate in recent years, particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), represent a potentially doubly-alluring combination. While there is enormous potential benefit in applying AI techniques in neuroscience to "decode" brain activity and associated mental states, these efforts are still in the early stages, and there is a danger in using these unproven technologies prematurely, especially in important, real-world contexts. Yet, such premature use has begun to emerge in several high-stakes set-tings, including the law, health &amp; wellness, employment, and transportation. In light of the potential seductive allure of these technologies, we need to be vigilant in monitoring their scientific validity and challenging both unsubstantiated claims and misuse, while still actively supporting their continued development and proper use.},

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human thought processes and consciousness on computer systems. Experts have gone so far as to chart the future development of AI systems that surpass human intelligence as a single civilization-shifting event, known as the "technological singularity" or "the Singularity." But in the more near future, AI promises to have more concrete applications throughout our everyday lives, including in education, a challenge that China has already taken up. At present, the main applications of this so-called "weak" artificial intelligence in Chinese education are MOOC, web classes, and the flipped class model, with the results already proving outstanding. With the deeper combination of AI and education, we can look forward to benefits like the increasing usefulness of after-school tutoring robots, reliving teachers of burdensome responsibilities, and balancing global education resources. We should, however, also use AI in education reasonably by contextualizing gathered data, strengthening legal protections, and developing moral guidelines in machine programming. Addressing these three points will address the concerns of many laypeople as AI systems are implemented, offering protection for their fragile beginnings in education and encouraging the development of better ones in the future.},

The traditional manual assessment is low in efficiency, high in cost, and has many limitations. However, the automatic assessment of spoken English can be realized with the help of artificial intelligence technology, which is an important reform direction for the future oral English teaching and evaluation. This article introduces the principle of automatic oral English assessment based on artificial intelligence technology, and discusses the feasibility of using artificial intelligence technology to partially replace manual scoring in oral English assessment, exploring the way to improve the stability and objectivity of assessment by using artificial intelligence technology, discussing the application of artificial intelligence technology in oral English autonomous learning, and also putting forward some suggestions on how to further improve the accuracy of artificial intelligence scoring in oral English assessment.},

abstract = {Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.},

Explainable AI (XAI) aims at making state of the art opaque models more transparent, and defends AI-based outcomes endorsed with a rationale explanation, i.e., an explanation that has as target the non-technical users. XAI and Responsible AI principles defend the fact that the audience expertise should be included in the evaluation of explainable AI systems. However, AI has not yet reached all public and audiences, some of which may need it the most. One example of domain where accessibility has not much been influenced by the latest AI advances is cultural heritage.

In the Basic and Informed Search module of TAILS students learn about various search algorithms by first observing how each algorithm searches a map, watching the construction of the corresponding search tree as the path planning proceeds. Once students understand the differences between algorithms, they proceed to exercises. Students are provided a version of the program with the search algorithm replaced by a comment that guides the students through the process of implementing each algorithm and testing it with the existing application. This enables the students to focus on the AI aspect of the coding without requiring them to also develop the user interface. This poster describes the search module and assessments and presents preliminary results.},

As an essential part of Chinese medicine, TCM nursing is guided by the holistic view of TCM and the concept of dialectical nursing. It can significantly improve by providing TCM characteristics of daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and appropriate nursing techniques. The life quality of patients meets the patients' needs for medical and health services. At present, the application of artificial intelligence technology of Chinese medicine nursing is still in its infancy. This article aims to review the application of artificial intelligence in dialectical nursing, daily life nursing, diet nursing, emotional nursing, and traditional Chinese medicine nursing technology. It also discusses the potential challenges of artificial intelligence and its prospects for application. Provide a reference for the development of the field.},

At the same time, the system uses neural network regression fitting, natural language processing based on the combination of rules and statistics to convert unintuitive professional offshore wind speed forecast data into user-friendly forecast text. Upon experiment, the system greatly optimizes the inaccurate positioning of large-area sea areas, reduces the error value of the weather forecast model, and reduces the current forecast processing time from 45-60 minutes to 2-4 minutes, greatly improves theefficiencyand effects of marine weather forecasting processesand enhances the autonomous navigation capability of ships.},

abstract = {Tennis is a unique and beautiful sport. In recent years, tennis has become more and more enthusiastic around the world, and some tennis academies have sprung up like bamboo shoots. With the gradual improvement of the tennis atmosphere, the tennis crowd has gradually increased, but at this time there is a lack of a comprehensive tennis training base and a scientific and systematic talent training model to promote the development of Chinese tennis in the future. And it happens to be a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this article studies and discusses the training path of tennis talents in colleges and universities based on artificial intelligence. Through an in-depth analysis of the training path of our country's tennis competitive talents, the current stage of our country's tennis talent training mainly relies on the following three methods: sports team training model; club training model; government, enterprise, and family joint training model. Through the introduction of artificial intelligence-related technologies, experiments on these three methods are conducted in the artificial intelligence environment. The results show that, compared with ordinary tennis talent training models, the physical and humanistic qualities of college tennis talents get 30%. The improvement of the service period and technical level of college tennis competitive talents has also reached 10% compared with the traditional training path. This shows that in the current global environment, combining the training path of tennis competitive talents in colleges and universities with the emerging artificial intelligence technology, the effect is very significant, and it is the development trend of future tennis competitive talent training.},

How is online teaching affecting the experience and well-being of students? How may any negative impacts may be offset? In what ways can benefits be maximised and enhanced by the implementation of digital devices in teaching? These questions are explored in this study through the undertaking of both primary and secondary research. The study introduces the contextual background to the topic in light of the implementation of online teaching in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic from both a global perspective and that of higher education in Hong Kong. The primary data admitted to this study for analysis consists of both questionnaire and interview data derived from teachers of English Language teaching online at higher education institutions across Hong Kong. This variety of primary questionnaire and interview data should allow for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data, allowing for some triangulation of findings from either source.},

abstract = {As 'control' is increasingly ceded to AI systems, potentially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) humanity may be facing an identity crisis sooner rather than later, whereby the notion of 'intelligence' no longer remains solely our own. This paper characterizes the problem in terms of an impending loss of control and proposes a relational shift in our attitude towards AI. The shortcomings of value alignment as a solution to the problem are outlined which necessitate an extension of these principles. One such approach is considering strongly relational Indigenous epistemologies. The value of Indigenous perspectives has not been canvassed widely in the literature. Their utility becomes clear when considering the existence of well-developed epistemologies adept at accounting for the non-human, a task that defies Western anthropocentrism. Accommodating AI by considering it as part of our network is a step towards building a symbiotic relationship. Given that AGI questions our fundamental notions of what it means to have human rights, it is argued that in order to co-exist, we find assistance in Indigenous traditions such as the Hawaiian and Lakota ontologies. Lakota rituals provide comfort with the conception of non-human soul-bearer while Hawaiian stories provide possible relational schema to frame our relationship with AI.},

In order to explore the application of computational thinking in teaching, this study first collected the main review papers, as well as the literature on the assessment of computational thinking, and examined their views. Then, this study proposes a learning method that integrates computational thinking into experiential learning theory and applies it to learning artificial intelligence techniques.},

We analyzed the functional requirements of the system corresponding to different user. By buiding Ubuntu operating system as the computing platform and exploring the object-oriented dynamic teaching environment provided by artificial intelligence platform, we build the LAMP development environment with MySQL database and PHP script language. We constructed a three-tier separated architecture system by using B/S mode, and refined the design and implementation of each module function through the secondary development of platform module plug-ins. To exhibit the advantages of the artificial intelligence system, we take college English teaching as an example to illustrate its functions. The functions of curriculum creation, teaching resources and activity design can be realized in the system, which verifies the effectiveness of the artificial intelligence system in interactive teaching and learning.},

However, the learning of argumentation skills is limited due to the lack of individual learning conditions for students. Within this dissertation, I aim to explore the potential of adaptive argumentation skill learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) by designing, implementing, and evaluating new technology-enhanced pedagogical concepts to actively support students in developing the ability to argue in a structured, logical, and reflective way. I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.},

This leads to new developments and challenges in education with regard to competency-based learning and recognition practices, especially as educational biographies become increasingly diverse and extensive repetitions of qualifications should be avoided. Until recently, a common assessment strategy for previously developed competencies has not been established in higher education. In this study, competencies expected in German vocational and higher educational programming training were identified, compared and evaluated with regard to equivalence. The methodological approach started with an extensive review of general frameworks and curricula, before competency descriptions and analyses of reference documents of German vocational and university programming education were gathered and systematically compared. As part of the iterative design process, a comparison matrix was developed, and common features along with gaps and overlaps of competencies were identified. Even though both educational tracks pursue different goals, they share a great number of expected programming competencies. In the context of lifelong learning, the proposed process can be utilized for improving the permeability and recognition practises in both vocational training and higher education.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs. We conclude this article with an introduction of the articles included in this special issue.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang &amp; Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

Governments have been eager to adopt artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including for the prediction of risk in social services. Child protection services are exploring predictive analytics for the initial screening of cases. While research identifies data quality issues as a major barrier, little is known about the characteristics of these issues in child protection, their relationship to organizational memory contained in administrative data, and their impact on the ability of an organization to adopt these technologies. This study gained insight into the socio-technical limitations of duplicate records when trying to bring organizational memory to bear in predictive decision support by interviewing and observing staff use of information technology systems. The study's findings suggest that record duplication in case management systems in child protection could pose a significant challenge to the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies such as predictive analytics for decision assistance. There is a need to address foundational information management and system issues before artificial intelligence approaches such as this can be introduced in the child protection sector.},

Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.},

abstract = {The report's purpose is to discover whether individual differences are connected with student expectations for learning analytics. The aim was to evaluate if the Big Five personality traits are connected to student predictions about learning analytics. Learning analytics is well-positioned to greatly improve student learning. There are many unanswered questions that are intertwined in that belief, which deals with learning analytics as a whole. Students' learning processes can be better supported and understood by using learning analytics. The goal of this investigation is to examine students' ideas about learning analytics tools' attributes and their interest in applying these features for education. In a first-stage investigation, researchers interviewed 364 university students. Smart PLS was used to carry out data analysis. Research that involves exploratory research will benefit from using partial least squares (PLS). The equal engagement of all stakeholders, from external organisations to individual students, is a challenge faced by each university given the global interest in learning analytics. Student expectations of learning analytics elements were discovered, and students are looking for support with planning and organising their learning processes, tools for self-assessment, delivery of adaptive recommendations, and personal evaluations of their learning.},

abstract = {Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.},

In this article, we propose a semantic analysis approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Apriori algorithm, and we realize application to improve media monitoring reports by mining large-scale news text. First, we propose to use LDA model to mine news text topic words and reducing news dimensionality. Then, we propose to use Apriori algorithm to discovering the relationship of topic words. Finally, we discovery the relevance of news text topic words and show the intensity and dependency among topic words through drawing. This application can realize to extract the news topics and discover the correlation and dependency among news topics in mass news text. The results show that the method based on LDA and Apriori can help the media monitoring staff to better understand the hidden knowledge in the news text and improve the media analysis report.},

abstract = {Since the concept of "artificial intelligence" was put forward in 1956, it has been very successful both in application and promotion, and gradually changed its name to engineering technology. So far, it has been used for automatic translation, remote control, robot design and manufacturing, language and image analysis, genetic programming, automated factories, automated programming, aviation and aerospace applications, a large amount of information processing, information storage. The management and execution of complex or large-scale tasks that the human body can complete has great research value for artificial intelligence in these areas. The purpose of this article is to study the construction of a mechanical control system based on artificial intelligence technology. In this document, the motion and rotation equation models of the robotic arm are defined. According to the case in the report, calculate the maximum torque that each arm joint can bear, and use the calculated specific data parameters in the experiment and compare it in the literature. The experimental results are compared with the experimental results of this article. Through the research of the engine control system, based on a large amount of research and practice, this paper examines the threats and loopholes of the system in detail, and designs a system based on WINdow7. This paper uses the data obtained in the actual evaluation and practice of the system and the calculation results of the actual operation method to verify the rationality, feasibility and value of the artificial intelligence-based mechanical operating system. Experimental research shows that based on the artificial intelligence technology proposed in this paper, the specific rotation value of each joint is determined to be as high as 300 degrees through actual observation and practice. The data and the related formulas are calculated, and the results obtained are more reliable and true. It proved the feasibility and value of the mechanical control system specified in this article.},

abstract = {With the gradual enrichment of people's material life, more people have a stronger desire to pursue spiritual life. As an important carrier of physical education (PD) in colleges and universities, (artificial intelligence) AI technology, its role cannot be ignored. However, at this stage, the intelligent construction of college gymnasiums in our country is still in its infancy, and there is still a lot of room for development. The purpose of this article is to study the innovative application of AI technology in college PD. Taking the gymnasium of the college of PD as the object, through the analysis of the intelligent system of the gymnasium of the sports college, the integration and linkage functions of its AI system are discussed, and related issues in the planning and design of the intelligent system of the college gymnasium are proposed, and these issues are discussed. It is proposed that relevant design factors should be fully considered when designing the intelligent system of college gymnasiums, so as to realize the goals of advanced technology, maturity, reasonable economy, practical functions, safety and reliability, and sustainable development. The college gymnasium is an important support point for the development of college sports teaching innovation. Its AI system has strong professionalism. In the early stage of its planning and design, the entire gymnasium needs to be accurately positioned in conjunction with the corresponding sports items, and the gymnasium accepts the main personnel are the starting point, and the relevant information system layout is guided by the difference of different spatial information needs, which fully reflects the "people-oriented" principle. The experimental results show that the scores of students in the experimental group are mostly 85 points and above, while the results of students in the control group are concentrated in the range of 65 to 85. The practical ability of PD students under the AI gymnasium has improved significantly. Students are explaining and organizing actions. There is a good learning ability in teaching activities.},

abstract = {Prediction of undergraduate grades before their course enrollments is beneficial to the student’s learning plan on selective courses and failure warnings to compulsory courses in Chinese higher education. This study proposed to use a deep learning-based model composed of sparse attention layers, convolutional neural layers, and a fully connected layer, called Sparse Attention Convolutional Neural Networks (SACNN), to predict undergraduate grades. Concretely, sparse attention layers response to the fact that courses have different contributions to the grade prediction of the target course; convolutional neural layers aim to capture the one-dimensional temporal feature on these courses organized in terms; the fully connected layer is to complete the final classification based on achieved features. We collected a dataset including grade records, student’s demographics and course descriptions from our institution in the past five years. The dataset contained about 54k grade records from 1307 students and 137 courses, where all mentioned methods were evaluated by the hold-out evaluation. The result shows SACNN achieves 81% prediction precision and 85% accuracy on the failure prediction, which is more effective than those compared methods. Besides, SACNN delivers a potential explanation to the reason of the predicted result, thanks to the sparse attention layer. This study provides a useful technique for personalized learning and course relationship discovery in undergraduate education.},

abstract = {The processes of innovation that organizations of the knowledge society need to implement are often oriented towards achieving higher levels of well-being, benefits for society, sustainable development, etc. Higher education institutions maintain a relevant role in this context because of the impact they can generate from establishing linkage projects; these can be established from paradigms such as open innovation and the quadruple helix model. Thus, the training models of higher education institutions must be aligned with the type of human capital that society requires, that is, people with innovation and entrepreneurial competencies that impact on social benefits for the community. The purpose of this document is to present the current status of a doctoral thesis research plan regarding the development of competencies for social entrepreneurship from the linkage in higher education institutions. To comprehensively understand the research problem, a literature review is presented, as well as a mixed-methods study with a sequential, concurrent design to collect qualitative and quantitative data. The results are expected to set guidelines to propose a training model for the development of social entrepreneurship competencies from linking projects.

abstract = {Economic indicators are key statistics based on economy, some examples of economic indicators are inflation rate, gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, consumer price indices (CPI), interest rate, exports, consumption of energy, among others. Most of the published studies are focused on contextualizing and predict a particular economic indicator without considering the current general situation on how non-linear models have been used in predicting some of the economic indicators. This article, has analyzed in the scientific production the artificial intelligence methods mostly used in the development of prediction models of economic indicators. The study was carried out by means of a systematic literature review (SLR) using the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar bibliographic databases (BD) as resources. The documents and general information analyzed qualitatively are filtered between the range of years 2015 to 2019 to which an adequate set of quality and selection criteria were applied. The approach of the research questions allowed to describe the outcomes in categories where the studies by predicted economic indicator and applied artificial intelligence method have been successfully included. The outcomes that have been obtained in this article represent a starting point for researchers, academics and professionals who wish to carry out studies related to the prediction of economic indicators using some artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In conclusion, some of the artificial intelligence methods used to predict economic indicators are artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive systems of diffuse neuro inference (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), support vector regression (SVR), machines extreme learning and other machine learning (ML) techniques.},

abstract = {Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.},

abstract = {Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.},

The study found that the substitution effect of artificial intelligence on women's employment is greater than its compensation effect, and there is a phenomenon of "machine replacement". Using the intermediary effect model to examine the intermediary role of human capital in the influence of artificial intelligence on women's employment, it is found that the medium and high-skilled human capital plays a significant role in the intermediary of women's employment. Finally, the paper puts forward some suggestions to promote women's employment in the era of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {There is an enormous disadvantage for students who, due to different situations, have decided to return to higher education after a prolonged period of time, in the face of an educational system designed for optimal conditions for students. The disadvantage deepens when already in their adult stage, the time for academic dedication decreases due to their work occupations. This proposal aims to adapt the pedagogical model to their needs, specific needs in logic and mathematical operability, time, mobility, and location. Achieving this requires the design of a hybrid application based primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to achieve the adaptation to the student through the correct training of neural networks, resulting in the identification of the specific requirements of each user and the selection and application of strategies, teaching techniques and content of the mathematics program to be learned and apprehended by the person who must remedy the shortcomings caused by the cessation and in many cases by a poor academic process. The following is a tour through the different aspects that support the proposal; from the need presented by students with academic cessation to the approach of a technological and specific solution for each individual starting from the generality of the causes to the possibility of giving a unique result thanks to the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.},

abstract = {With the development of computer technology, electronic engineering, statistics and other disciplines, artificial intelligence (AI) has made breakthroughs in the medical field, and intelligent diagnosis and treatment has become an important development trend. The core methodological research of AI focuses on machine learning, and machine learning on clinical medicine is the key technology for using medical big data. Lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world. Early CT screening can reduce the mortality of lung cancer patients. However, there are currently a large number of screenings, a large workload of physicians, and a high rate of missed diagnosis. This article explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) screening for early lung cancer, and discusses the clinical significance of this method in the diagnosis of lung nodules. In lung cancer diagnosis, a lot of work has been done in computer-aided diagnosis, including traditional image processing methods, traditional machine learning methods, deep learning methods, and convolutional neural networks. This article compares and analyzes the output results of the Tumar Deep-Dimensional Lung Nodule Intelligent Diagnosis System and the diagnosis results of the chest C-images of the two-person reading patient, and studies the important value of artificial intelligence in the early screening of lung cancer.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and learning due to its quick progress. &nbsp;Any creation made with the help of artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence. The experimental results show that the proposed method develops smart teaching (98.1%), flexibility (96.5%), performance (93.6%), participation (94.9%), and interaction (95.1%).},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are rapidly developing fields, garnering increased attention from the public, as well as academia and industry. Recent advances allow us to use our smart devices at home to control TVs, speakers, and lights. A smart speaker that is plugged into the wall can handle powerful processing that can service complex user requests. However, as we rely more and more on AI conveniences, we expect them to be at our disposal when we are moving around. In this poster, we present preliminary work on the development of a new upper-level undergraduate course open to all computer science, electrical engineering, and applied mathematics students at Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT). The new course, titled Embedded AI (EAI), introduces topics from embedded systems, artificial intelligence, digital signal processing, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. The proposed course includes lectures introducing the theory behind each topic and laboratory assignments that provide the students with the hands-on experience. At the end of the semester, students develop an embedded AI project of their own. An interdisciplinary academic team of computer scientists and electrical and computer engineers has been working on a curriculum and researching different platforms, datasets and sensors that will ultimately enable students at WIT to develop an embedded device that can support AI tasks as well as give the students the practical skills that employers seek. Handouts will be prepared with sample curriculum and breakdown of topics.},

abstract = {Taiwanese opera is the important culture inheritance in Taiwan, however, this culture inheritance is dying in recently years. Although the Taiwan government and various Taiwanese opera troupes have worked hard for many years to promote this culture to campuses, and held several interest courses; this culture inheritance is still losing and dying. For elder people, Taiwanese opera and Taiwanese cultures are both precious culture treasures and parts of their childhood memories. Nowadays, young people in Taiwan are no longer familiar to Taiwanese, neither to Taiwanese opera singings. It is hard for young people to learn how appreciating this traditional culture. In this study, we refer to the current promotion methods of drama troupes which learn the singing method and posture of Taiwanese opera, we combine artificial intelligence techniques into traditional Taiwanese opera on singing and posture. The proposed system could analyzes students’ voice and postures, and then assists teachers to improve the learning performance of students. Students could compare their singing skill or postures with professional actors and adjust their singing and posture. Students of Taiwanese opera interest class can practice independently without professional teacher's guidance at home. In campus promotion, this game-like promotion method brings young people more acceptance of Taiwanese opera.},

abstract = {The development of the Energy Internet puts forward higher requirements for new-type information acquisition systems of power consumption. A collaborative scheduling method for information acquisition tasks based on artificial intelligence is proposed in this paper, relying on artificial intelligence algorithms for the coordinated scheduling of concentrator tasks. The core task scheduling of acquisition system does not require the management of complete terminal tasks, and dramatically reduces the pressure of core task scheduling and efficiently completes the task of data acquisition. This paper gives specific implementation steps and detailed flowcharts, and through the analysis of examples, the effectiveness of the method is verified. The proposed method further expands the effective way for the intelligent acquisition of the system.},

abstract = {Successful early detection of Covid-19 disease plays an important role in improving the effectiveness of treatment and managing the pandemic. Various diagnostic methods for the rapid detection of COVID-19 are presented. The first and most important test to detect Covid19 is the PCR test. Studies have shown that PCR testing is time-consuming, expensive, and has a large number of false negatives. As a trend in the scientific community, artificial intelligence has succeeded in Covid19 detection and diagnosis. This article identifies the key achievements reflected in the performance measurement indicators of the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in Covid-19 detection. Besides, this study discusses the finding and future lessons as a roadmap for Corona Pandemic Age. Mean diagnosis of all AI algorithms in the studies performed through Radiology modality had sensitivity with an average higher than 95% and a specificity of higher than 92%, which have a higher diagnostic rate than of traditional radiological methods. Based on relevant research in the field of diagnosis of Covid-19, the Health care managers and Specialists could be able to manage the Pandemic much better and scientifically. Equipping devices and Radiological Center by AI Algorithms and software can cause increases covid19 identification tests and hence can cover more people exposed to Diagnosing Test. This study presents a comprehensive review of Artificial Intelligence techniques and evolving deep learning techniques for Covid-19 Detection.},

abstract = {With the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI technology has been widely used in various fields of social and economic life, bringing great impact to various industries. AI is a section of computer science, a new science technology that studies and develops theories, methods, and application systems used. The development of artificial intelligence technology first has a profound impact on the development of the accounting industry, which leads to the change of the demand for accounting talents. This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students’ experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields. An in-depth study of the challenges of artificial intelligence technology to accounting education is also of reference and guiding significance for the reform and development of engineering education and other fields.},

Health professionals are expected to fulfill many roles and within the narrative of AI/ML health professionals can hold multiple roles. We performed a scoping review using the academic database Scopus, the 70 databases accessible through EBSCO-Host and the database Canadian Newsstream through which we accessed 300 Canadian English language papers as sources. We found minimal engagement with the roles of the covered health professionals related to AI/ML whereby nurses were covered much more than the other health professionals. The main role mentioned for all occupations covered in our study was the one of clinical user. Many other roles expected from health professionals such as being advocates for their field and clients or being policy developers, educators and researchers were rarely or not at all mentioned depending on the health professional. Our role narrative analysis of AI/ML related to the covered health professionals reveals significant gaps in need to be filled.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making remarkable achievements even in creative fields such as aesthetics. However, whether those outside the machine learning (ML) community can sufficiently interpret or agree with their results, especially in such highly subjective domains, is being questioned. In this paper, we try to understand how different user communities reason about AI algorithm results in subjective domains. We designed AI Mirror, a research probe that tells users the algorithmically predicted aesthetic scores of photographs. We conducted a user study of the system with 18 participants from three different groups: AI/ML experts, domain experts (photographers), and general public members. They performed tasks consisting of taking photos and reasoning about AI Mirror's prediction algorithm with think-aloud sessions, surveys, and interviews. The results showed the following: (1) Users understood the AI using their own group-specific expertise; (2) Users employed various strategies to close the gap between their judgments and AI predictions overtime; (3) The difference between users' thoughts and AI pre-dictions was negatively related with users' perceptions of the AI's interpretability and reasonability. We also discuss design considerations for AI-infused systems in subjective domains.},

Robinson, Sam Wyly, J.C.R. Licklider, Ivan Sutherland, Larry Roberts, Robert Kahn, Marvin Minsky, Michael Dertouzos, and Joseph Traub, as well as his own. John has woven them together via introductions that is, in essence, a personal walk down the computer industry road. John had the unique advantage of having been part of, or witness to, much of the history contained in these oral histories beginning as a co-op student at Arthur D. Little, Inc., in the 1950's. Eventually, he would become a pioneer in his own right by creating the computer industry's first successful software products company (Cullinane Corporation). However, an added benefit of reading these oral histories is that they contain important messages for our leaders of today, at all levels, including that government, industry, and academia can accomplish great things when working together in an effective way. This is how the computer industry was created, which then led to the Internet, both totally unanticipated just 75 years ago.},

The aim of this paper was to investigate if the perceptions of IT-students regarding their own soft skills have changed over a period of 3 years. To do this a questionnaire was distributed in 2019 to the same students who completed this questionnaire in 2016, and the results were analysed. The results of this study showed that although soft skills should increase from student's first year of study to their final year, this is not how the students perceive the development of their own soft skills. The biggest improvements were in the students' perceptions of their skills in cross-cultural relationships, work ethic, decision-making and critical thinking. The skills for client management, time management, professionalism and leadership were perceived as lower. The results confirmed that the IT-students' own perceptions are not a reliable way of measuring their soft skills. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of factors for further study, and according to this results the important soft skills were: Communication; Conflict management; Critical thinking; Interpersonal relations and teamwork; Leadership and Emotional intelligence; Multidisciplinary thinking; Professionalism and work ethic; and Self-management. These can now be used in further research on soft skills.},

Educators teach the subject to inform students about their possible advantages and risks. Recently, various resources have been designed to teach AI, however, these resources generally fail to meet an interdisciplinary approach and do not narrate the overall picture of AI development. To address this gap, we developed a 36-week open-source AI curriculum for middle school education. Our contribution is threefold: (1) Providing interdisciplinary connections to reveal the background of developing a new technology (2) Structuring the recent resources in the field to ease the integration of AI into classrooms (3) Presenting an inclusive approach with online and unplugged activities. In this paper, we present the design process of our curriculum, details about the lecture structures and it's supplementary materials. Finally, we share our observations from the teacher (n=18) and student (n=60) workshops.},

abstract = {This study explored the impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) has on the evaluation of creative elements in artistic videos. The aim was to verify to what extent the use of an AI algorithm (Style Transfer) contributes to changes in the perceived creativity of the videos. Creativity was evaluated in six quantitative items (Likert-type scale) and one qualitative question (qualitative description of the creativity expressed in the video by two words or expressions). Six videos were shown to both control (N = 49) and experimental group (N = 52) aiming at determining possible differences in creativity assessment criteria. Furthermore, both groups contained experts (Experimental, N = 27; Control, N = 25) and non-experts (Experimental, N = 25; Control, N = 24). The first round of videos composed of six videos that were the same for both the experimental and control condition (used to check for bias). No significant differences were found. In a second round, six videos were shown with AI transformation (experimental condition) and without that transformation (control group). Results showed that in two cases the perceived creativity increased in experimental condition, in one case a decrease occurred. In most evaluations no differences were observed. Qualitative evaluations reinforce the absence of a general pattern of improvements in AI transformations. Altogether, the results emphasize the importance of human mediation in the application of AI in creative production: a hybrid approach, or rather, Hybrid Intelligence.},

For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.},

abstract = {The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.},

abstract = {Sustainable Development (SD) is an increasingly important topic. Humanity has an absolutely vital dependence on a set of natural and artificial resources. The advancement of knowledge needed to adequately manage these resources has traditionally been achieved through specialization. In this strategy of dividing and ruling, what was gained in depth was lost in coverage. Yet, the most recent problems are intensely interdisciplinary, revealing that the previous specialization strategy is currently not wrong, but clearly insufficient. Strangely (or not), various courses in higher education continued to follow the traditional specialization strategy. As a result of this state-of-affairs, several conferences currently exist, both in the field of Education or in the field of Sustainability, but it has been particularly difficult to attract participants to deepen the theme of Teaching Sustainability. As an attempt to contribute to clarifying the needs of the present and future, this TEEM’21 track presents itself as a space for presenting results and debating works and strategies that involve both domains: Teaching and Sustainability.},

abstract = {In the prevailing knowledge-driven economic society and increasingly digitizing world, knowledge as the very important resource claims a key position in the success of companies and institutions. It is even more so in the knowledge-intensive institutions like in higher education. Its proper management incorporates three main components, namely People, Technology and Process. It is the coherence between these main components that determines the success of a Knowledge Management System (KMS). Since the later years of last decade, the advancement in the features of technology hardware and their functionalities have brought more focus on the technology capabilities to serve the human resource beyond representing and processing information. Moreover, the growing digital-native generation also forms the basis for the application of advancing features of technology into the processes to efficiently utilize the knowledge resources for greater educational and research endeavors towards sustainability of higher education. This Systematic Literature review, therefore, describes the methodology developed to conduct the review and provides analysis of the findings exploring the trend in the application of information technologies in higher education KMS. It will also identify gaps where more research needed and describing lessons acquired for contextual application of KMS in developing countries' higher education.},

abstract = {Many couples struggle with infertility, and opt for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Selecting the embryo with the highest chance of resulting in pregnancy, is one of the most critical steps of the ART procedure. The implantation potential of an embryo is associated with its morphology which includes assessing cell cleavage stages. Today, the assessment is mainly done manually by visual examination by embryologist and therefore is often subjective. Deep learning (DL) models can be used to automatically classify cell cleavage stages, and make the embryo assessment process efficient, objective. However, it is important that embryologists understand and trust the DL predictions, and in this paper we evaluate the potential of three explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. First, we compare the two XAI techniques Grad-CAM and LIME to identify important characteristics in embryo images associated with specific embryo cleavage stages. Both approaches identified biologically relevant morphological characteristics, but generally Grad-CAM was more consistent than LIME. Secondly, we suggest an approach on how to use the XAI technique SHAP to identify image characteristics that caused some images to be misclassified. The identified image characteristics had meaningful biological interpretation such as fragmentation. Overall the study demonstrates that DL in combination XAI can be useful in embryo assessment and selection.},

The article presents the results of a detailed study of the opinions of leading scientists involved in the study of social aspects of AI. The key characteristics of AI that carry criminological risks are identified, the types of criminological risks of using AI are identified, the author's classification of these risks is proposed. The results of a detailed analysis of the legal regulation of the legal personality of AI are presented. Formulated options for bringing to justice those responsible for the actions of the AI, having the ability to self-learning, who decided to commit actions / inactions that qualify as a crime. Authors argue the need for a clear, rigorous and effective definition of ethical frameworks in the development, design, production, use and modification of AI. Arguments are made about the need to recognize AI as a source of increased danger. The paper analyzes the content of the resolution of the European Parliament on the possibility of endowing AI with "legal status". Special attention is paid to the question of giving the AI a personality. It is proposed to use legal fiction as a technique in which the specific legal personality of AI can be perceived as a non-standard legal position, different from reality. It is assumed that such a decision can remove a number of legal restrictions that exist today and prevent the active involvement of AI in the legal space.},

abstract = {The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.},

abstract = {We present an overview of a "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence" course that is part of a large online course platform for upper second level students. We take a novel approach to teaching fundamental AI concepts that does not require code, and assumes little prior knowledge including only basic mathematics. The design ethos is for students to gain an understanding of how algorithms can "learn". Many misconceptions exist about this term with respect to AI and can lead to confusion and more serious misconceptions, particularly for students who engage with AI-enabled tools regularly. This approach aims to provide insights into how AI actually works, to demystify and remove barriers to more advanced learning, and to emphasize the important roles of ethics and bias in AI. We took several steps to engage students, including videos narrated by a final-year second-level student (US 12th grade). We present design and logistics particulars on this course which is currently being taken by ~7,000 students in Ireland. We believe this will be of value to other educators and the wider community.},

In this work, we take a modular Statechart-based game AI modelling approach and develop a reuse strategy to enable fast development of new AIs. This is aided through the creation of a standardized interface for Statechart modules in a layered architecture. Reuse is enabled at a high-level through functional groups that encapsulate behaviour.These concepts are solidified with the development of the SkyAI tool. SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal.},

The combination of artificial intelligence and psychology can be widely used in various fields such as national life, agricultural production, product development, and garrison construction. This study analyzes and explores whether there is a correlation between parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability, which can provide a basis for subsequent artificial intelligence to detect emotions. This paper mainly uses offline collection of micro-expression recognition data and filling out questionnaires at the same time to collect data and conduct survey research. A total of 175 questionnaires were collected, of which 175 were valid. 110 data of micro-expression recognition were collected, of which 100 were valid. The results found that there was a significant correlation between the parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability of college students. Specifically, the rejection dimension of parents was significantly and negatively correlated with micro-expression recognition ability. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of fields, among which the combination of machine learning and expression recognition can effectively improve the possibility of screening out suspicious people in specific situations.},

abstract = {Latest technological innovations like Cloud-based mobile technologies and virtual and Augmented Reality (AR) have the ability to create great learning experiences. However, few researches exist regarding how AR can be utilized and integrated to complement learning. Currently, the existing research focuses on integrating AR in classes to aid students but few dwells on integrating AR in online learning platforms applications. The increased use of mobile devices has allowed the introduction of online learning management systems that allow people to access e-books, papers, and articles online. As technological inventions continue to emerge, there is a need to investigate and internalize how these new technologies can complement learning. In this research, we investigate how the integration of VR and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies can improve learning in Australian Higher Education. We conduct a survey to determine how the integration of AR and artificial in the Moodle learning management system can impact the user experiences. We then discuss the current development in virtual and AR and Cloud-based mobile technologies in the education system through a literature review. Our preliminary analysis shows that integration of AR and artificial intelligence may lead to better learning experiences.},

Methodology: Literature research of AI approaches, app prototype descriptive analysis, and simple comparison analysis of app and theoretical AI approaches. Results: Newly developed application prototype for e-material formatting is created to improve screen-reading abilities and comfort and improve learning processes. The app works by using several AI approaches and elements: machine learning, perceptron, decision tree graphs, rule-based system, classification, and deep learning. The app collects data and analyses them based on the training database. After, app categorises data by decision tree method. Finally, it decides for formatting recommendation to suggest and make appropriate document formatting. The app receives users' feedback after use. Conclusions: The app uses all collected data for the deep learning process to improve personalised recommendations to create the user-centred design. Currently, it is a narrow range use app designed for e-study use on MOOC type platforms for user group without specific limitations or disabilities. The app is with several level formatting possibilities, including deeply personalised formatting. That create and provide more effective e-materials as it increases visual perception, legibility, readability, reading comprehension, and memorability of content.

abstract = {As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely. These principles may encourage new thinking about the development, design, training, and release into the world of increasingly autonomous agents.},

Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.},

abstract = {For the higher education system, we have established an evaluation model that combines the AHP method with the TOPISIS method to specify whether a country's higher education system is healthy and sustainable. we get the result that CR=0.024 &lt;0.1 in H1-P and CR=0.042 &lt;0.1 in H2-P. Based on the results of 12 indicators, we divided the countries around the world into five gradients, and selected 6 representative countries to display relevant data, and China's score is 0.1568. Finally, we have established a Damping Trend model to predict the sustainability of China's future development and the time it will take for China to reach the goal of the second-tier national higher education quality level is 2035. The method of our article can be effectively applied to the policy making process of any country to achieve the fastest improvement of the country's higher education quality system.},

Predominately white and male, opportunities in STEM continue to grow exponentially. Areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for example are expected to become $11 trillion industries by 2025. As employers struggle to find skilled candidates, we face the reality that African Americans are too often left behind. African Americans make up less than 5% of the IT workforce and a small percentage of IT graduates. Although there is acknowledgment and some investment by both industry and educational institutions, there has been minimal success in changing the demographic landscape. This study focuses on how AI can be used to better understand barriers, personalize student experiences, and provide pathways of attainment for an increasingly diverse student body.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is challenging teacher professionalism, thus how to define a teacher in the AI era has become a hot topic in education. Many studies adopted a teacher literacy perspective on redefining a teacher for artificial intelligence in education(AIEd), while ignoring the sociological observation of the challenges faced with teachers in their professional field. This paper was framed by the core concept “professional capital” from sociology, the revolutionary power in the field, analyzed the trend of education field evolving from traditional education to AIEd. Based on the analysis, the paper proposed that, teacher professional capital is the impetus that empowers teachers to reconstruct their professional identity in the AI era. Teacher professional capital for AIEd mainly manifests itself in three forms: teacher human capital(THC), representing teacher agency to teach with AI at the individual level; teacher social capital(TSC), representing the synergetic resources circulating in teachers’ social networks at the interpersonal system; teacher decisional capital(TDC), representing the collaborative decision-making power at the human-AI level. In teachers’ professional practice, THC empowers teachers the capability to transit from traditional education field to AIEd field; TSC endows teachers the power to leverage other people's professional capital to teach with AI; TDC ensures teachers professional autonomy to teach with AI in a reasonable and legal manner.},

The literature on polyp detection shows widely varying miss rates among clinicians, with averages ranging around 22%--27%. While recent work has considered the use of AI support systems for polyp detection, how to visualise and integrate these systems into clinical practice is an open question. In this work, we explore the design of visual markers as used in an AI support system for colonoscopy. Supported by the gastroenterologists in our team, we designed seven unique visual markers and rendered them on real-life patient video footage. Through an online survey targeting relevant clinical staff (N = 36), we evaluated these designs and obtained initial insights and understanding into the way in which clinical staff envision AI to integrate in their daily work-environment. Our results provide concrete recommendations for the future deployment of AI support systems in continuous, adaptive scenarios.},

In order to solve the complex power resource scheduling problem, this paper uses the artificial intelligence expert service system. The expert service system simulates the thinking mode of experts, and based on the knowledge and experience of experts, provides solutions for the scheduling problems in power system, such as accident handling, daily arrangement, power system equipment operation, etc. Expert service system includes knowledge base, production rules and control system. The knowledge base is generated by the knowledge and experience of experts, and the inference mechanism is used to select and use the content of the knowledge base to generate the rule set, according to which the control of the system is realized. It is proved that the expert service system is feasible in power resource scheduling. The expert service system improves the efficiency of power resource scheduling and reduces the workload of scheduling personnel. With the deepening of artificial intelligence research, various intelligent expert systems will appear in various fields of power system.},

With immergence of technology and growing demand of the society, if appropriately applied, Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) can also leverage the benefit of e-Governance by collaborative resource sharing and service-usage through grid and cloud computing. The underlying goals for adopting e-Governance practices are to ensure improved quality in disseminating education and administration; establish dynamic and need-based communication with various internal, external and peer entities; and conforming to regulations. Grid and cloud can be two candidate frameworks for HEIs governance, which will potentially lower the cost of governance solutions and provide better services. In this paper, the authors propose grid and cloud based e-Governance frameworks for Bangladeshi HEIs. Also a survey is conducted to find perception of various stakeholders about grid and cloud based e-Governance.},

A systematic literature review methodology was adopted in this study. Out of 161 articles retrieved, 33 of them that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Our study revealed that the use of CT at HEIs for programming education began in 2010; many studies did not specify the context of use, but the use of CT is found to be gaining grounds in many contexts, especially the developed countries; course design approach was mostly employed by educators to introduce CT at HEIs for programming education. Furthermore, this study pointed out how CT approach can be explored for designing a smart learning environment to support students in learning computer programming.},

abstract = {Advanced information technologies have enabled Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which have the potential to transform higher education around the world. Why are some institutions eager to embrace this technology-enabled model of teaching, while others remain reluctant to jump aboard? Applying the theory of absorptive capacity, we study the role of a university's educational IT capabilities in becoming an early MOOC producer. Examining the history of MOOC offerings by U.S. colleges and universities, we find that prior IT capabilities, such as (1) the use of Web 2.0, social media and other interactive tools for teaching and (2) experience with distance education and hybrid teaching, are positively associated with the early exploration of MOOCs. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of educational IT capabilities is moderated by social integration mechanisms and activation triggers. For example, when instructional IT supporting services are highly decentralized, educational IT capabilities have a greater impact on the probability of a university offering a MOOC. In addition, for colleges facing an adverse environment, such as those experience a decline in college applications, the effect of IT capabilities on the exploration of MOOCs is much stronger.},

abstract = {The public and academic discussion on Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is accelerating and the general public is becoming more aware AI ethics issues such as data privacy in these systems. To guide ethical development of AI systems, governmental and institutional actors, as well as companies, have drafted various guidelines for ethical AI. Though these guidelines are becoming increasingly common, they have been criticized for a lack of impact on industrial practice. There seems to be a gap between research and practice in the area, though its exact nature remains unknown. In this paper, we present a gap analysis of the current state of the art by comparing practices of 39 companies that work with AI systems to the seven key requirements for trustworthy AI presented in the “The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. The key finding of this paper is that there is indeed notable gap between AI ethics guidelines and practice. Especially practices considering the novel requirements for software development, requirements of societal and environmental well-being and diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness were not tackled by companies.},

In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.},

abstract = {Abstract: With the continuous development of AI technology, the training of massive data and the emergence of large-scale models have made stand-alone model training increasingly unable to meet the needs of AI applications. Distributed machine learning technologies (such as data parallelism and model parallelism) have appeared at historic moments and will have extreme large-scale application scenarios. At present, the training speed of distributed machine learning models is slow, and the scale of model parameters is still the main problem in this field. From the perspective of model parallelism, this article aims to design the optimal division method for different models under model parallelism by analyzing the structure of the existing AI application model. According to the framework structure of artificial intelligence application model, design the model optimization partition strategy and model based on parallelism. A network architecture suitable for accelerating AI application training, focusing on solving technical problems, such as network architecture design based on AI applications and model optimization and partitioning under model parallelization.},

abstract = {Modern malware increasingly takes advantage of information hiding to avoid detection, spread infections, and obfuscate code. A major offensive strategy exploits steganography to conceal scripts or URLs, which can be used to steal credentials or retrieve additional payloads. A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.},

abstract = {Today, Spanish universities are already adapted to the Common European Higher Education Area, which is based on the acquisition of competences by the student. Nevertheless, while the acquisition of specific competences is well assumed by the different subjects of each degree, the same is not true for cross-curricular competences. More specifically, in most engineering studies, these competences are developed indirectly through elective subjects or other complementary training activities. The main objective of this work is to design a prototype of a low-cost and open-access exoskeleton that can be used in different engineering degrees for the acquisition of cross-curricular competences. Once this prototype has been designed, we propose to use it in a practice to be carried out in the laboratory following the project-based learning methodology from a STEAM approach. With the use of a robotics kit and a project-based learning methodology, we achieve the goals of educational robotics and computational thinking in a higher education environment.},

abstract = {Objective: To compare the development status of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine among the United States (US), China and India with bibliometric analysis. Methods: Articles involving AI in medicine published from 2015 to 2019 were retrieved on March 30, 2020 from Web of Science Core Collection. The country-level and the institution-level performance of the US, China and India in the field of AI in medicine were compared with indicators including the amount of papers, 5-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the amount of papers, the amount of highly-cited papers, the proportion of highly-cited papers and the average citations per paper. In addition, the research hotspots and international cooperation of the three countries in recent 5 years were compared by conducting keywords co-occurrence analysis and co-authorship analysis in VOSviewer. Results: From 2015 to 2019, The US has published 7838 papers and 154 highly-cited papers in the field of AI in medicine, with an average citations per paper to be 9.3, and the proportion of highly-cited papers to be 2.0 %. China has output 6635 papers and 73 highly-cited papers in this field, with an average citations per paper to be 5.3, and the proportion of highly-cited papers to be 1.1%. India has output 3895 papers and 22 highly-cited papers in this field, with an average citations per paper to be 3.6, and the proportion of highly-cited papers to be 0.6%. The 5-year CAGR of the US, China and India in the period of 2015~2019 were 16.0%, 25.4% and 2.4%, respectively. At the institutional level, most of these indicators were significantly better for the US institutions than for Chinese and Indian ones. There were four research hotspots in this field, namely medical imaging technology, health big data mining, disease prediction with biomarkers and genetic information, and early diagnosis of neurological disease. The three countries focused on different hotspots, with China focusing relatively less on health big data mining, while the US and India being complementary to each other. As to international cooperation, the average links per paper to other countries were 0.60, 0.40 and 0.20, respectively, for the US, China and India. Conclusions: In the field of AI in medicine, the US, with a number of competitive institutions in AI and medical researches, is taking a definitely leading role, having conducted many innovative researches and cooperated extensively with other countries. China is taking the second leading role at the country level, with top institutions somewhat less productive than those in the US. India is the third productive country, with top institutions obvious less productive than those in the US, and with research hotspots exactly complementary to the US.},

Even though distributed computing has provided remarkable advances (more precisely in dealing with big data), non-decomposable NP problems are still intractable in many real-world applications. And, from quantum computing perspective, solving complex problems with universal quantum gates requires developing of quantum algorithms. Considering commercializing quantum annealing machines by D-Wave, achieving global optimum for discrete optimization problems has been realized. In this study, a novel approach has been introduced to convert symbolic AI problems into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form. More narrowly, this method represents classification of text documents (fragments) as optimizing a QUBO function. After embedding the train corpus into a QUBO function, D-Wave quantum annealer is used to classify new observations with finding the minimum energy level of the system.},

From the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC), all word formation errors tagged as [fm2] were collected, processed and analyzed. It was found that Chinese college students mainly made four types of errors in word formation. The most common word formation errors in Chinese college students’ writings were erroneous irregular inflections and compound words. The author argues that overgeneralization and the complex processes of English word formation are the main causes of these errors. The findings are significant in helping Chinese English learners identify their errors in word formation and telling teachers what errors learners have made in word formation.},

abstract = {Higher education institutions (HEIs) internationally are increasingly recognising the importance of understanding student study choices. This is especially true in the field of computing in which skills shortages in the labour market are high but so too are student dropout rates. Loss of interest in the computing field has been reported among the reasons for students dropping out. The aim of this study is to offer a fresh perspective of the factors influencing undergraduate student’s interest and choice of specialisation in computing. Previous studies have mainly focused on five ACM-identified computing disciplines: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. With the ever-growing nature of computing, two more disciplines recently emerged: Cybersecurity and Data Science. HEIs continuously endeavour to expand computing programmes into specialist areas within these disciplines such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, robotics and creative computing. For prospective students, this maze of options can make for a difficult decision. 137 first-year computing students were invited to participate in a mixed-methods survey to explore their choices around cybersecurity and other newer specialisations. The results of the survey were matched with findings from recent literature, and show that personal interest, family, media, career prospects and prior experiences still influence student choices, with media appearing to have a greater impact compared to earlier studies. HEIs can use this when developing effective recruitment strategies in computing.},

abstract = {The authors of this article single out the main characteristic of the digital economy---the constantly changing volume of information, as a result of which the need to thoroughly disseminate digital technologies meant to stimulate the formation of new ways and methods of property management, the growth of the industry efficiency and the development of the economy as a whole arises.The article remarks on one of the most significant drawbacks of the digital economy---reducing a significant number of jobs, which can later lead to some serious threats to the economic security of the state such as the increase in polarization of the populace incomes, which can result in strengthening of social tensions, the "disappearance" of a number of professions, which will inevitably lead to an increase in unemployment rate, which, in its turn, will contribute to the growth of crime.Currently, when the system of university education is undergoing colossal changes, the questions of digitalization of universities' business and organizational communication processes are the topics of particular interest to both the students and their employees. The topicality of the problem is based on the need to analyze current practices in organizational communications and approaches to creation and development of policies and strategies of introduction of digitalization elements in higher education organizations aimed at ensuring their competitiveness in the globalized world.The goal of this work lies in systematization of current issues in the higher education sphere in the Russian Federation and development of measures of education system development in Russia considering the digitalization processes.The authors of this article regard the following as main issues preventing the educational system development:• insufficient financing of the educational system;• commercialization of higher education;• low prestige of secondary education and secondary special education.},

abstract = {Ransomware is a class of malware that gains unauthorized admittance to organizational and personal assets and blocks their access to legitimate users and staff. It accomplishes this by encrypting the algorithms with a strong encryption technique. The Hacker demands a ransom to allow access to the asset and revert the control to the authorized organizations. Many individuals and Organizations have been victim to such Ransomware Attacks. With the mounting growth of technology, such attacks have increased exponentially and the need for adequate preventive techniques are also increasing. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art Ransomware detection techniques implemented to resist such attacks. While most surveys focus on ransomware detection using Machine learning techniques, this survey concentrates on Ransomware techniques that apply the sub-domains of Artificial Intelligence. This paper reviews detection techniques that employ Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques, which are sub-fields of AI for ransomware detection. Though the reviewed works have good detection rates, a few open concerns are identified and discussed. The primary objective of the review is to highlight concerns of the proposed system that prevent it from becoming effective in real-time systems.},

abstract = {Machines have long been created by humans to serve many needs in life. In the length of history of technology development, they gradually improved, along with the amount and type of assigned and more diverse assigned tasks. However, the application level of the machines only stops at simple things, only requires strength and accuracy. In the areas that require flexibility, the ability to analyze situations, human intelligence, and artificial intelligence is the brain that originates the wisdom of machines. The potential benefits they bring seem impossible to limit, and the new way to utilize artificial intelligence does not stop appearing. This paper mainly deals with the issues surrounding the application of artificial intelligence to life and in approaching a rather complex language like Japanese. The application of artificial intelligence to Japanese language teaching and learning will be of great significance, helping both learners and teachers achieve certain goals in today's modern society. The paper is completed through documents, surveys and confirms the indispensable importance of artificial intelligence in the field of education.},

abstract = {The application of artificial intelligence in early teaching resulted in the intelligent teaching System. It is a comprehensive subject involving computer science, artificial intelligence, psychology, education and behavior. Its main purpose is to make the computer system the guidance and assistant of learning, to endure the intelligence to the computer system, and to replace the human teacher to some extent, to achieve the best teaching effect. From the perspective of results, it changes the traditional teaching mode and teaching environment, can complete the teaching task in the traditional teaching mode, while playing an irreplaceable good teaching effect. However, in the development of computer network technology, people's demand has gradually increased, intelligent teaching system also began to show its own shortcomings, such as: low degree of intelligence and personalization, waste of a lot of student information resources, lack of knowledge base and other shortcomings. In this paper, the data mining technology is applied to the development of intelligent teaching system, so as to mine more and more important information in the student information database, and the knowledge base is fully applied or reorganized or enriched. By using the data mining technology for reference, the intelligent and personalized service of the intelligent teaching system is strengthened.},

abstract = {StarCraft is one of the most successful real-time strategy (RTS) games and is also actively being researched by artificial intelligence (AI) communities. Since 2010, game AI researchers have hosted annual AI competition events to develop human-level RTS AIs using StarCraft. It ranks the AI bots by their winning ratio from thousands of AI vs. AI matches without human involvement. It is questionable whether successful AI bots are also competitive and preferable to human players. In this study, we invited 20 experienced players with varying expertise to evaluate skill levels, overall performance and human likeness of AI bots. Results show that human's ranking of AI bots are not identical to the current one from AI competitions. It suggests the need for developing new AI competitions that consider human factors ("human-likeness" or "adaptation"). Also, it revealed that the expertise levels of human players have high impact on overall performance and human-likeness evaluations of AI bots. It supports the concept of dynamically adjusting AI bots to satisfy different levels of human players. The outcomes of this study will also be useful to incorporate human factors in other active video AI competitions (e.g., Angry Birds, Fighting Game, and General Game Playing).},

abstract = {People with visual impairments use assistive technology, e.g., screen readers, to navigate and read PDFs. However, such screen readers need extra information about the logical structure of the PDF, such as the reading order, header levels, and mathematical formulas, described in readable form to navigate the document in a meaningful way. This logical structure can be added to a PDF with tags. Creating tags for a PDF is time-consuming, and requires awareness and expert knowledge. Hence, most PDFs are left untagged, and as a result, they are poorly readable or unreadable for people who rely on screen readers. STEM documents are particularly problematic with their complex document structure and complicated mathematical formulae. These inaccessible PDFs present a major barrier for people with visual impairments wishing to pursue studies or careers in STEM fields, who cannot easily read studies and publications from their field. The goal of this Ph.D. is to apply artificial intelligence for document analysis to reasonably automate the remediation process of PDFs and present a solution for large mathematical formulae accessibility in PDFs. With these new methods, the Ph.D. research aims to lower barriers to creating accessible scientific PDFs, by reducing the time, effort, and expertise necessary to do so, ultimately facilitating greater access to scientific documents for people with visual impairments.},

abstract = {Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.},

abstract = {Digital ecosystem has transformed our lives in a connected living through multiple networks and technologies, five billion individuals in the world have access to the internet. The interaction with these technologies not only provides the immediate supply of any virtual content but increases the possibilities of personalization through artificial intelligence (AI). AI in all of its developments, is advancing faster than the capacity of institutions and organizations to provide legal and deontological responses. Finding solutions to its implications in new ecosystems where technology learns from human routines and interacts with users is a challenge that must be addressed from the academic, political and business fields. Technology advances show that algorithms and automatization have become omnipresent in contemporary times, increasingly determining the nature of the contents that reach the users. This work offers an interpretative descriptive framework based on two main objectives: firstly, describing the evolution of voice assistants as tools for the automated personalization of information contents —about which each individual becomes aware of his environment and makes decisions; and secondly, highlighting the ethical demands on AI when personalizing contents in voice interfaces. In result the study presented offers an open debate to the increasing concern that algorithms can actually influence people, replicating or amplifying existing biases, bringing a wide and current field for academics to explore.},

abstract = {The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks. The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases. The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.},

To address this challenge, this thesis considers the development of AI based virtual assistants applied in higher education, in a form of a lesson learned system, a recommender system integrated with a chatbot, to help students , solve problems similar to those they face in the different stages of their software project development by recommending previous lessons learned. The innovative contribution lies in the implementation of the described techniques from the state-of-art artificial intelligence field in an educational platform with the goal to leverage the experience gained during years of the teaching a Capstone Course in Software Engineering to new student generations who might benefit from this universal knowledge gained previously, in order to assist software engineering students to enhance their learning experience.},

The greatest challenge we face is how to process and understand this raw and unstructured data, go beyond individual observations and see the “big picture”—the domain of Situation Awareness. We provide an extensive survey of Artificial Intelligence research, focusing on microblog social media data with applications to Situation Awareness, that gives the seminal work and state-of-the-art approaches across six thematic areas: Crime, Disasters, Finance, Physical Environment, Politics, and Health and Population. We provide a novel, unified methodological perspective, identify key results and challenges, and present ongoing research directions.},

In this paper we present an ns-3 simulation framework, able to implement AI algorithms for the optimization of wireless networks. Our pipeline consists of: (i) a new geometry-based mobility-dependent channel model for V2X; (ii) all the layers of a 5G-NR-compliant protocol stack, based on the ns3-mmwave module; (iii) a new application to simulate V2X data transmission, and (iv) a new intelligent entity for the control of the network via AI. Thanks to its flexible and modular design, researchers can use this tool to implement, train, and evaluate their own algorithms in a realistic and controlled environment. We test the behavior of our framework in a Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS) scenario, where AI functionalities are implemented using Reinforcement Learning (RL), and demonstrate that it promotes better network optimization compared to baseline solutions that do not implement AI.},

We focus on respecting the student's learning pace, specifically that of students with higher capabilities and/or higher performance. Hence, we propose the creation of development classrooms or labs in research groups of excellence, which will enhance learning for these groups of students. For this we require the help from the Ministry of Education. Clearly, we must make university teachers aware that these types of students have special educational needs. Further, students with high abilities are not always high-achieving students. Therefore, we must train the university teacher in the detection of these students, and in proper intervention in those cases. Finally, students with high capabilities must be made conscious of their need for a different approach: they should learn to demand their rights, for the good of all.},

abstract = {The philosopher Aristotle seeks the definition of man as a political being, responsible for making decisions. Political decisions generate changes in their environment and in producing change they seek constant adaptations, which in turn leads to contradictions, inconsistencies, truths, falsehoods. So soon, studies of the non-classical logical calls [2] have become a tool as an aid in the making of decisions. The logic calls attention to the brilliance of containing provisions contrary to some of the basic principles of Aristotelian Logic, such as the contradiction. In this article, the use of the technology allows proposing a structured decision making contained in the unified process Paraconsistent Logic. The unified process Paraconsistent Logic aims to be a facilitator in supporting the construction of the decision support and adherent the Paraconsistent Decision Method proposed in the studies with announcements for project recount in the function point analysis technique. A network of paraconsistent analysis can be used applications focused on the use of artificial intelligence, situations that the classic logic does not meet in its fullness, for the simple fact of operating with only two states, true or false, paraconsistent has a lot of room to deal with data inconsistencies and with real-world uncertainties.},

abstract = {The transportation sector is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is estimated that replacing fossil fuel-based vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) powered by sustainable and renewable energy could contribute to approximately 21% of emission avoidance by 2050. To improve the efficiency of EV operation, various artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been applied. Examples include charging system optimization, self-driving car technology, and traffic control technology. To understand the current readiness status of those technologies applications, a small database of AI use in EVs that is in practice globally is constructed. There are 23 locations of prototype projects identified. The projects are categorized by the AI type, developer type, size of operation, and readiness status. Readiness status is analysed with the Japan Technology Readiness Assessment (J-TRA) methodology. There are seven analysed parameters: 1) Market, 2) Technology development, 3) System Integration, 4) Sustainability Verification, 5) Safety, 6) Commercialization and 7) Cost and Risk. The results show that while there is a promising market, steady progress in technological development, and verified environmental benefits, more work is needed to ensure safety and integration with the current systems before the technology can reach higher readiness levels of commercialization, cost, and risk-coping mechanisms.},

Most governments, enterprises, and scientific research institutions are participating in the COVID-19 struggle to curb the spread of the pandemic. As a powerful tool against COVID-19, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are widely used in combating this pandemic. In this survey, we investigate the main scope and contributions of AI in combating COVID-19 from the aspects of disease detection and diagnosis, virology and pathogenesis, drug and vaccine development, and epidemic and transmission prediction. In addition, we summarize the available data and resources that can be used for AI-based COVID-19 research. Finally, the main challenges and potential directions of AI in fighting against COVID-19 are discussed. Currently, AI mainly focuses on medical image inspection, genomics, drug development, and transmission prediction, and thus AI still has great potential in this field. This survey presents medical and AI researchers with a comprehensive view of the existing and potential applications of AI technology in combating COVID-19 with the goal of inspiring researchers to continue to maximize the advantages of AI and big data to fight COVID-19.},

Two techniques, the fuzzy state machine (FuSM) and the emotional behaviour tree (EBT), were reviewed and compared. In addition, an alternate and simple mechanism to incorporate emotion in a behaviour tree is proposed and tested. Initial tests of the mechanism show that it is a viable and promising mechanism for effectively tracking the emotional state of an NPC and for incorporating emotion in NPC decision making.},

Then players decide how to deal with so that they have the greatest chance to win. But artificial intelligence is very good at analyzing and predicting. Our goal is to predict the winner of League of legends and analyze the potential mechanism. The data set of this paper comes from kaggle website that provides a desirable base for the procedure of machine learning to analyze the relationship among data and game results. It contains 9879 samples in total, including 38 features. Based on machine learning method, the game player's winning situation can be predicted. The results show that the Support vector machine model with linear kernel function has a greater advantage in predicting the game, about 73%. This study has practical significance for the development of the game industry and the improvement of the skills of players.},

abstract = {The primary goal of this paper is to explore how Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) can assist in reviewing, understanding, and drawing conclusions from text datasets. We explore NLP techniques for the analysis and the extraction of useful information from the text of twelve national strategies on artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, we are using a set of machine learning algorithms in order to (a) extract the most significant keywords and summarize each strategy document, (b) discover and assign topics to each document, and (c) cluster the strategies based on their pair-wise similarity. Using the results of the analysis, we discuss the findings and highlight critical issues that emerge from the national strategies for artificial intelligence, such as the importance of the data ecosystem for the development of AI, the increasing considerations about ethical and safety issues, as well as the growing ambition of many countries to lead in the AI race. Utilizing the LDA topic model, we were able to reveal the distributions of thematic sub-topics among the strategic documents. The topic modelling distributions were then used along with other document similarity measures as an input for the clustering of the strategic documents into groups. The results revealed three clusters of countries with a visible differentiation between the strategies of China and Japan on the one hand and the Scandinavian strategies (plus the German and the Luxemburgish) one on the other. The former promote technology and innovation-driven development plans in order to integrate AI with the economy, while the latter share a common view regarding the role of the public sector both as a promoter and investor but also as a user and beneficiary of AI, and give a higher priority to the ethical &amp; safety issues that are connected to the development of AI.},

However, the rapid growth of social media has accelerated the creation and circulation of such information and turned it into a potential threat to the main societal institutions such as peace and democracy. Although many of iconic figures, policymakers, business leaders and researchers have warned us of serious repercussions of misinformation, a clear course of action is not yet visible. To tackle such an issue, the preliminary step would be the evaluation of the as-is situation, which allows us to identify the deficiencies of existing solutions. This issue has been addressed in this study by a comprehensive analysis over decades of societal efforts against misinformation. In this analysis, quelling strategies from organisational and government perspectives are explained. Then they are investigated from efficacy level and governance mode. Our analyses show that, despite a seemingly suitable setting for confronting misinformation, there is a major shortcoming in governance mode of current quelling strategies.},

However, there is a current lack of research relating to best practice for teaching this complex topic area which encompasses both computing and mathematics knowledge. This paper outlines an initial study that set out to determine the threshold concepts within this domain through use of the One Minute Paper technique with students currently studying AI. Our results identified a number of specific models which students found troublesome including the support vector machine, recurrent neural network and the multilayer perceptron. The results indicated that topics related to deep learning were more complex for the students to fully comprehend and students may require greater in-depth tuition and alternative support mechanisms in this area in particular. Further investigation is needed to determine the heterogeneity of content delivered on courses relating to AI as well as additional studies at other HE institutions to gather more data on potential threshold concepts and the best methods to teach them.},

abstract = {There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.},

With the accelerated integration of artificial intelligence technology in the intelligent manufacturing process and the international production division networks, its impact on the evolution of the global value chain needs further in-depth study. This paper examines the effects, heterogeneity and mechanism of the artificial intelligence on the dynamic evolution of global value chains. The study found that the development of artificial intelligence is conducive to promoting the upgrading of the division of labor in the global value chain, and the robustness test also confirms this finding. This role is more prominent in the samples of developed economies. Furthermore, artificial intelligence technology can promote the global value chain by improving the human capital accumulation and strengthening innovation capabilities. In the context of new infrastructure construction and digital economy transformation, this article provides implications for deepening the integration of innovation chain and industrial chain, and promoting high-quality development with the new generation of information technologies.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of higher education students using e-learning technology, collaborative learning has been suggested as a solution to the lack of sufficient support to learners in e-learning environments, particularly LMS (Learning Management System). Nevertheless, current collaborative learning puts a heavy emphasis on group discussion, but provides inadequate support for individual learners to promote teamwork during the whole learning process.The aim of this paper is to propose an intelligent LMS able to improve student's collaboration practices in higher education. The system provides teachers information about the levels of collaboration and productivity of each student and group; and as a result, teachers exploit data provided to promote collaborative learning, avoid students' isolation and motivate them to use collaboration tools. The intelligent LMS called "smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS" integrates a Multi-Agents System (MAS) responsible to the tracking of collaboration and productivity levels of each student and group. On the other hand, in order to optimize the large-scale resource management, the proposed smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS is based on a cloud computing architecture.},

abstract = {The purpose of athletes playing basketball is to shoot and score. Basketball requires athletes to have the ability to quickly change offense and defense, and have strong physical fitness. Basketball is a combination of skills and physical fitness. Athletes who want to use superb skills flexibly in the game must have corresponding physical fitness. Physical fitness is the basic condition for athletes to play for a long time. With the continuous development of basketball, the confrontation intensity in the basketball game is becoming more and more fierce, and the physical fitness requirements of basketball players are getting higher and higher. This article first analyzes the current research status of basketball physical training, then studies the training process and specific characteristics of basketball physical training, and finally designs the experiment. Taking 4 basketball teams from 4 major colleges and universities in a certain city in China as the research object, through the four teams were randomly selected into a control group and an experimental group. The control group used the previous training method, and the experimental group used the new training method. After the experiment, the teams in the experimental group and the control group were tested on physical fitness indicators. The test results showed that the improvement of the experimental group's performance on all indicators was greater than that of the control group.},

On another way there are several terminologies that attempt to specify the best teaching and learning methods applied to engineering, from problem-based learning, project-based learning, work-based learning, team-learning, self-direct learning for example. However motivational studies and motivational scales typically discard uncertainty characteristic in for quantitatively evaluating the different dimensions on student's motivational assessment in (e)-learning environments. This paper presents a computerized framework grounded on Artificial Intelligence techniques, namely the Case Based Reasoning approach for problem solving, complemented with a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning method that considers unknown, incomplete or even self-contradictory data or knowledge in the motivational student's assessment.},

abstract = {Development of accurate measurement systems to assess digital government advance is a critical topic of digital agenda of academia and governments around the world. There are several quantitative approaches such as rankings and indicators that have contributed to measure the progress of digital government initiatives in the public sector, but more sophisticated computational tools are usually unexploited. This article proposes a computational multi-parametric analysis of multiple metrics of digital government advance using a computational technique, the neural networks, for the analysis of the evolution of digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009-2015. Neural networks analysis has been used in different areas such as scientometric performance profiles, and disciplines like physics, chemistry, management, economics and demography. The neural networks analysis helps to identify clusters of characterizations that represents digital government advance patterns of performance. It also locates various profiles of digital government progress with similar patterns of performance and atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools. The results of this computational technique are robust showing that artificial intelligence tools are useful instruments to evaluate digital government advance overtime.},

abstract = {As people's enthusiasm for postgraduate entrance examinations has increased, mobile postgraduate entrance examination products have become increasingly important in the product market. By collecting the prices of domestic postgraduate entrance examination products from 2016 to 2017, a polynomial fitting curve mathematical model is established to predict mobile postgraduate entrance examinations. The purpose of the product price change trend. Aiming at the potential market share and development trend of the mobile end-of-study product, a Markov chain prediction method model and multivariate fitting are combined with genetic algorithms to perform intelligent prediction, and the contribution of each indicator is allocated according to the weight to obtain The relative importance of the indicators completes the possibility of launching a mobile end-of-year research product. The study also found that in different cities, the mobile terminal's feasibility is the same in different cities, and the model can indeed solve relatively many different universities. The city fully considers the characteristics of economic, social conditions and postgraduate education, and evaluates the possibility of launching mobile terminal postgraduate research products through computer artificial intelligence algorithm models.},

abstract = {Currently, many people share news, links, or videos, without being aware of the impact they can have on people's decisions or ways of acting. A clear example, recently experienced in Colombia, corresponds to the national strike which happened at the time of this research. Due to these unexpected circumstances, colombians experienced the influence news have on decision making that can affect the country, not only economically but politically, and socially. It showed how news can generate fear in people, or even misinform, as is the case of fake news. For these reasons, it is key to determine the relevance a story can have. Predicting the impact, will allow us to pay more attention to those news that can affect people more, avoiding misinformation and fake news. However, the problem is that there is no way of predicting the impact that a press article can have. Therefore, the aim of this work is to implement a machine learning model that allows us to predict, with the best possible accuracy, the virality of online press articles (defining virality as the amount of clicks that an article receives when it is opened). In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which focuses on machine learning projects. The best obtained result corresponds to the model where the core of the architecture was based on BERT, a pre-trained model, which, for a pair of press articles headlines, predicted whether the first headline would be more viral than the second one. On the other hand, the evaluation was carried out by comparing the amount of clicks for a pair of articles. For a practitioner point of view, digital marketers can use our results to select the best words for their online marketing campaign. For a theoretical point of view, our results present an innovative natural language processing approach based on one of the best breed of Neural network models (BERT).},

abstract = {With an increase in the automation of cyber-physical systems (e.g., automated vehicles and robots), quality problems such as off-nominal behaviors (ONBs) have also increased. While there are techniques that can find ONBs at the requirements engineering stage as it reduces the cost of addressing defects early in development, they do not meet the current industrial needs and often ignore functional safety. These techniques suffer from limitations such as scalability, need for significant human effort and inability to detect overlooked or unknown ONBs. To address these limitations we need a technique that analyzes requirements with respect to functional safety, but with less human effort. To achieve this, we propose our artificial intelligence-based model-driven methodology that provides a means to find ONBs during requirements engineering with minimal human effort. Our methodology utilizes existing approaches such as causal component model (CCM) and systems theoretic process analysis (STPA). We describe the details of each step of our approach and how our approach would support finding ONBs. Using our research and the results of our studies, we intend to provide empirical evidence that considering ONBs during requirements engineering stage and analyzing requirements with respect to functional safety can help create more robust designs and higher-quality products.},

abstract = {Cancer, a disease that has gradually attracted attention in the world now, it has even become one of the main causes of death. Among them, liver cancer occurs in the liver or deadly tumors starting from the liver. According to the World Cancer Report (2014), the liver cancer is primary the cancer that the occurrence of 6% ranked second highest, and the death rate is 9% ranked sixth. So the liver cancer has become the target of academic research and discussion. If we can find out the key factors that affect the death of liver cancer when identifying liver cancer, it can improve the survival prediction of patients with liver cancer, and it will bring more effective treatment and confidence to the disease. In this paper, we chose a data that a real clinically diagnosed HCC patient was collected from a University of Coimbra and Coimbra Hospital in Portugal, and we separated the data into testing and training to predict the death of HCC and find out the key factors from the prediction model. The prediction model includes Decision Tree (DT), Support vector machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR). The results of this paper showed that the G-means of the three modeling methods are 0.76 (LR), 0.72 (DT), and 0.68 (SVM). The best performance is logistic regression (LR), and find out the key factors that affect the survival rate of HCC include Aspartate transaminase (U / L), Age at diagnosis, and Alkaline phosphatase (U / L).},

abstract = {With the transformation of medical model and the promotion of the construction of healthy China, continuing to follow the traditional development model has been unable to meet the health needs of the new era. As early as the 1970s, traditional Chinese medicine tried to connect with artificial intelligence technology to seek a breakthrough in the development model of traditional Chinese medicine. In the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial reform, artificial intelligence, as an important driving force, presents new characteristics such as deep learning, cross-border integration and man-machine cooperation, which is more conducive to the organic combination with traditional Chinese medicine. As a traditional Chinese medicine therapy, the five elements music therapy, with its unique pertinence, can make the five tones and the five internal organs reach a harmonious resonance state when the patients listen, and make the body resonate, so as to smooth the spirit and express their feelings. Five elements music therapy has achieved great results in clinical psychotherapy, and through the combination with artificial intelligence, five elements music therapy can be presented to patients in a closer way. This paper aims to explore the development of this innovative way.},

abstract = {The world of education has experienced very rapid development and devised a prioritized strategy in a disruptive era. This development is marked by the emergence of adaptive literacy in education. In this vein, it involved three important literacies, namely data literacy, technology literacy, and human literacy. Arguably, the development of education was also accompanied by the use of these three literacies in response to the Covid-19 and post-pandemic era. In this case, education undergoes an extensive transformation process to fulfil the learning process, especially learning English at the university level. Technically, this process involves a series of online learning activities and the use of appropriate technology to achieve the provision of skills, leadership, and social concerns. The reasons are related to communication skills, both oral and written, that enable the graduates to meet international professional standards by integrating literacy excellence. In this background, the research aims to describe the transformative process of the refining language curriculum that excels in the industry. This research uses mix-method. Besides, the respondents involve active BINUS University students who are contributively exposed by the industrial and entrepreneurial world. Data will be analyzed qualitatively. The preliminary result describes a process of redefining the curriculum of English learning that encompassed the utilization of technology and essential aspects of technology selection is more in line with the literacy era in the industrial revolution 4.0. Furthermore, this research will lead to curriculum alteration that is matched with the future industry needs eventually.},

abstract = {Estimating mobile signal strength accurately is a crucial task for network providers and their customers. However, current methodologies to estimate mobile signal strength present limitations in their practical implementation (i.e. physical based models), portability (i.e. spatial interpolation methods), simplicity and accuracy (i.e. path loss models). In this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of geospatial Big Data and advanced Artificial Intelligence to predict mobile signal strength at scale. Particularly, we used open access geo-spatial information about weather, tree coverage, land use, imperviousness, altitude and network infrastructure (i.e. a total of 174 features) to train and test uncertainty-aware artificial neural networks to predict mobile signal strength on data from the NetBravo crowdsourcing platform across all the United Kingdom (UK). Our model scored a best performance of 7.9 (standard deviation of 0.2) dBm for Root Mean Squared Error and 5.7 (standard deviation of 0.4) dBm for the Mean Absolute Error. Feature importance analysis showed that mobile cell tower characteristics and geospatial features showing the distribution of imperviousness and tree cover density over the line of sight between the mobile cell tower and the receiver as well as relative humidity were among the top 20 most important features.},

abstract = {There is little research on why underrepresented minorities are less likely to specifically study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). We surveyed 159 undergraduate students about their interest in, exposure to, and personal views on ML/AI in order to explore variations in responses by self-reported gender and race/ethnicity groups. We found that students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are ~6 times less likely to take a traditional ML/AI course than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity, but no significant difference was found between gender representation. Additionally, students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are more likely to report interest in social, cultural, and political impacts of ML/AI rather than the more technical aspects of ML/AI itself, which is a prevalent interest of students not underrepresented by race/ethnicity. We explore potential reasoning for this difference through further analysis of their survey responses. Encouragingly, we find that regardless of representational status 72.0% of students who report lack of interest in a traditional introductory course are interested in a ML/AI course that focuses more on the political, philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI and its impacts on society. Our findings suggest that a 'CS Principles" style introductory ML/AI course, emphasizing social and political impacts, could be an effective way to promote diversity in ML/AI.},

abstract = {Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.},

One of the most explicit and accessible ways in which governments outline these plans is through national strategy and policy documents. We follow a systematic search strategy to identify national AI policy documents across twenty-five countries. Through an analysis of these documents, including topic modelling, clustering, and reverse topic-search, we provide an overview of the topics discussed in national AI policies and contrast the differences between countries. Furthermore, we analyse the frequency of eleven ethical principles across our corpus.

abstract = {The presence of digital technologies in society is indisputable, it has impacted and transformed the lives of citizens. Higher education institutions are not left out of this transformation. The value of knowledge as a fundamental asset of the Knowledge Society is decisive. Its management is imposed as a competitive advantage. Part of the institutional resources must be dedicated to developing capacities to share, create and apply new knowledge continuously over time. Technological ecosystems, considered as the evolution of traditional information systems, are positioned as knowledge management systems that encompass both the technological component and the human factor. The application of techniques for educational data analysis, such as learning analytics, academic analytics, and educational data mining, are beginning to be positioned as appropriate strategies to optimize decision-making in higher education. It is interesting to wonder if universities are aware of these technological developments and, furthermore, if they are interested and prepared to incorporate them. The objective of the research is to investigate how, based on the capabilities of academic analytics for the improvement of the management of higher education, characteristics and functionalities can be defined that an applicable model should include in university institutions, particularly in Argentine.},

abstract = {This work presents an investigation for a number of mechanical conditions (healthy, imbalance, misalignment, gear fault, bearing fault). The vibration conditions are simulated and based on real-time vibration data that are acquired from a Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS). The diagnosis process passes through two main stages after the data acquisition, where then the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) method is applied to preprocess the obtained datasets (signals), and extract the features based on five statistical parameters namely: RMS, Kurtosis, Peak, Impulse Factor and Shape Factor. Then Artificial Intelligence (AI) based classification is applied using the Multilayer&nbsp;Feed-Forward&nbsp;Perceptron&nbsp;Neural Network (MLP) using different cases, where different number of neurons for the hidden layer and two different datasets of the input features with 250 features for each condition and also 2000 features for each condition once with normalized and also with non-normalized features to investigate the best cases for the performance classification in terms of neurons and features number, and also the impact of features normalization. The obtained results based on the classification performance using MLP-NN with the different cases are comparable, where the normalized features with less number of features and moderate neurons have shown better classification performance. Moreover, the results have shown the advantage of integrating CWT with the MLP-NN by providing significant classification rates for the different mechanical conditions.},

abstract = {The complexity and unexplainability of the artificial intelligence recommendation system make it difficult for ordinary users to understand its operating principle, often triggering two extreme emotions-extreme distrust and excessive trust. Therefore, it is very important to find out the factors that influence the behavior intentions of users in the artificial intelligence recommendation system and examine its effectiveness through empirical research. Taking technology acceptance theory as the research framework, and considering procedural fairness and system interpretability, this paper develops the usage intention model of artificial intelligence recommendation system, and carries out empirical research with the AMOS software. The empirical results show that the interpretability of the artificial intelligence recommendation system has a significant positive impact on user trust, usefulness, and ease of use; and procedural fairness has significant effect on trust and usefulness. The research results are helpful to further understand the impact of procedural fairness and interpretability on system usefulness and user behavior of artificial intelligence recommendation system, and offer guidance for further improvement of artificial intelligence recommendation system.},

abstract = {Emerging trends in Internet of things (IoT) has caught the attention of every domain e.g., industrial, business, and healthcare etc. Sensor-embedded IoT devices are the key drivers for collecting large amount of data. Managing these large datasets is one of the critical challenges to be tackled. Continuous huge information collection through sensor-enabled devices is known as the massive IoT (mIoT). Thus, there is a need of self-adaptive artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies to effectively cluster, examine and interpret the entire entities in the system. With increased data volumes and power hungry natured IoT devices it is a dire need to manage their power wisely. To fairly allot the power levels to the tiny portable devices it is important to integrate mIoT with AI-based techniques. To remedy these issues this paper proposes a novel cross-layer based energy optimization algorithm (CEOA) in mIoT system by examining the detailed features and data patterns. Experimental analysis reveals that proposed CEOA outperforms its competing counterpart i.e., Baseline in terms of efficient power management and monitoring.},

The study is based on data gathered through a questionnaire concerning students’ perceptions about assessment and teaching-learning methodologies in four academic years (2016-2017 to 2019-2020). The student´s access grades were included in the questionnaire since 2018-19 academic year allowing to establish a relationship with the final marks obtained in a core Chemical Engineering Topic, Fluid Mechanics. From the analysis made, it can be said that students who obtained higher access grades to HEI may have also a higher Chemical Engineering curricular unit final mark, although the low linear relationship obtained (r =0.45) for the year 2019-20.},

These organizations are increasingly applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care. Unfortunately, both health care systems and AI are confronted with a lack of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). This short paper focuses on the importance of integrating EDI concepts throughout the life cycle of AI in health. We discuss the risks that the lack of EDI in the design, development and implementation of AI-based tools might have on the already marginalized communities and populations in the healthcare setting. Moreover, we argue that integrating EDI principles and practice throughout the lifecycle of AI in health has an important role in achieving health equity for all populations. Further research needs to be conducted to explore how studies in AI-health have integrated.},

abstract = {Over the past decades, tremendous research efforts have been proposed to deploy Automatic Incident Detection Systems (AIDSs) onto urban roads. As a result, new challenges to the research community have been introduced to enhance the AIDS performances. To overcome these challenges, and to improve the efficiency and safety of road traffic, attention has been drawn to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a solution. However, choosing appropriate AI technologies to process real-time traffic data is an area that needs spotlighting. The aim of this paper is to discuss recent advancements in urban AIDSs based on AI techniques. We carried out a review for twelve previous AIDS study proposed since 2009. We compared these AIDSs in term of traffic data sources, input variables, and type of incident. Also, a comparison of simulators, techniques and the evaluation metrics has been used. The results indicated that hybrid AI techniques reported the best detection performances. In this context, fixed or fusion data sources were also given good results compared to others. This review shows reliable results of AI classification techniques applied in AIDS approaches. This finding urges to continue improve the performances of the proposed AI techniques. In future research, testing others AI techniques with smart technologies may increase the incident detection efficiency.},

In contrast to that, everyday explanations are social practices that are influenced by many factors, e.g. the social and institutional context of the explanation. Everyday explanations are therefore co-constructed by both the explainer and the explainee. Assuming that everyday co-constructed explanations are easy to understand for citizens, they can help to make AI understandable for people who do not have affinity for technology. In this context, concrete and simplified examples that are adapted to the needs of the learner can reduce the complexity of the explanation furthermore. This Ph.D. project investigates the effects of co-constructed explanations created while exploring notional machines on the mental models of AI of everyday people. The goal is to identify aspects of AI technology which are relevant for everyone, to empower people to become a responsible and active members of society in a digitalized world where AI technology is ubiqitious.},

At present, the development of track and field sports is developing rapidly under the background of AI. Although our country's track and field sports competition level has been improved, there is still a certain gap compared with the world's leading level. Awareness of physical exercise should be cultivated from an early age, and track and field physical education should not be neglected. Although cultural achievements are important, physical fitness training should also keep up. This article conducts a series of research and discussion on the development of track and field sports through AI decision tree algorithm. The development of our country's sports industry into a sports power is the strategic direction of my country's sports development and an important step in the change of our country's sports situation. Making our country a sports power is also the trend of sports development. As a world-renowned Olympic event, it has a huge impact, with the largest number of participating countries and regions, and the largest number of participants. In the Olympic Games, track and field sports events have 47 events, with the largest number of medals. Track and field sports can reflect the comprehensive sports strength of a country. For this reason, the ability of national athletes in track and field sports plays a very important role in realizing the dream of our country's sports power. Under the background of AI in modern society, experimental research results show that the development of track and field sports under artificial intelligence technology does have different changes.},

This article is based on the computer professional programming course "programming language I" as an example to rethink the teaching method. The difference between the new teaching method and the traditional teaching method is elaborated in detail from two aspects: classroom theory teaching and experimental practice teaching and the feasibility of the new teaching method are discussed from multiple angles. The new teaching method can fully arouse the enthusiasm of teachers 'teaching and students' learning, and realize deep learning of knowledge through experimental courses. At the same time, the new teaching methods have played a positive role in fostering students' learning initiative, teamwork spirit, language expression ability, problem analysis and problem solving skills. Under the new teaching method, the student group cultivated can better meet the current society's demand for talents.},

abstract = {The realization of intelligent education relies on the cross integration of artificial intelligence and the educational process, making education a traceable and visible process. This achieves the purpose of optimizing the teaching process and promoting learners to conduct personalized learning, thus creating an intelligent and technologically advanced learning environment. This paper collects the EEG signals of learners in learning process, and carries out the removal of noise and physiological artifact first, obtaining EEG signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address the problem of subjective indicators of attentiveness evaluation, this paper extracts a variety of features (power spectral density, eSense index, and sample entropy), and makes a comprehensive comparison, so as to evaluate the state of attentiveness objectively.},

abstract = {Issues on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are topics which are commonly discussed in public, science and politics. However, these important topics are hardly relevant in school up to now -- moreover, also teachers for computer science often have only little reliable knowledge about AI and its social impact on our future. For this reason, we develop and test teaching materials for the "Science Year AI" that contain not only aspects of computer science, but also social and ethical aspects. The teaching materials are designed in such a way that they can be used across disciplines and even by teachers of other subjects. In this paper, we introduce the simulation game for understanding machine learning that forms the core of the material.},

Further, questions such as what it means for AI to be accessible and inclusive, why is inclusive AI required, and how can it be achieved, is an emerging area of research. In this two-part workshop, we will explore the nuanced challenges towards Accessible and Inclusive AI together with participants with diverse backgrounds. First, we will collaboratively define Accessible and Inclusive AI (AIAI), building on the diverse experiences of the participants and moderators. The goal is to contribute to the formulation of a shared vision for Accessibility and AI as well as identify the challenges and opportunities towards realizing this vision. Working in small teams, participants will collaboratively conceptually design a future scenario for AIAI or critically analyse an example solution. The aim is for teams to tackle tough questions related to what it means for AI to be accessible and inclusive, while addressing algorithmic biases and limitations of AI, in addition to opportunities for overcoming them in the future. Finally, teams will present their conceptual designs and scenarios in the larger group. Overall, the workshop will ignite innovative, and even provocative, ideas and future scenarios, building towards an inclusive and accessible AI.},

abstract = {We propose a deontological approach to machine (or AI) ethics that avoids some weaknesses of an intuition-based system, such as that of Anderson and Anderson. In particular, it has no need to deal with conflicting intuitions, and it yields a more satisfactory account of when autonomy should be respected. We begin with a "dual standpoint'' theory of action that regards actions as grounded in reasons and therefore as having a conditional form that is suited to machine instructions. We then derive ethical principles based on formal properties that the reasons must exhibit to be coherent, and formulate the principles using quantified modal logic. We conclude that deontology not only provides a more satisfactory basis for machine ethics but endows the machine with an ability to explain its actions, thus contributing to transparency in AI.},

However, due to the outdated cultivation mode of the Master of Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering, there are few or no courses related to artificial intelligence in terms of curriculum setting, and the textbooks are not updated in time, which makes students lack of grasp of cutting-edge knowledge and scientific research methods. In terms of scientific research practice, it is simple in form and low in technology content, which leads to the insufficiency of students' comprehensive engineering application ability, and becomes the bottleneck of the cultivation of senior talents in software engineering under the background of artificial intelligence. With four modules of scientific selection system, multi-module curriculum system, practical training system and school-enterprise cooperation mechanism, the "Four-in-One" training mode is constructed to cultivate high-level, open, compound and international software talents.},

In this research paper, a first discussion on the development of a conceptual framework to research more rigorously the effects of AI in government is proposed. The proposed elements of the framework build upon the current understanding of the drivers influencing adoption of AI and takes into account the need for complementary organisational changes for increasing impact. The model follows a public value approach to understand the possible impact of AI on both the internal mechanism of the organisation, public service quality and broader societal effects.},

Driven by this wave of education, the school actively encourages teachers to develop various online courses that are not restricted by time and space, and promote the innovation of learning models. Through these online platforms, some colleges and universities have developed online courses for college students, hoping to stimulate learners' intrinsic motivation and cultivate students' personality through online courses and other teaching methods. However, online courses have constructed a complex engineering system, and there are currently some problems, such as the unclear layout of online courses, and similar professional content design and evaluation methods. How to build a university network governance system has become an important research direction for experts and scholars. This article introduces artificial intelligence, calculates the construction data of the university network governance system based on the fitness function of artificial intelligence and network algorithms, and constructs a model diagram of the university network governance system. It is hoped that this research can play a positive role in the governance of university networks.},

A similar degree of change applies to market dynamics, volatile customer requirements, shortened product lifecycles and the amounts of environmental uncertainties in the context of organisational innovation management. Strategic Foresight (SF) offers an approach to deal with environmental uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has huge potential to support SF by means of collecting and analysing data as well as automatizing information research and analysis tasks. The current paper analyses the potentials and organisational practices at the nexus of AI and SF. In the form of expert interviews, current practices and expected future application potentials of AI in SF are analysed. Furthermore, challenges and potential weaknesses of AI in this context are discussed and an outlook on potential future visions of AI in SF from practitioners’ points of view is provided. The results show that currently AI is only applied in a very limited way to support SF, mostly in terms of supporting trend and customer data analysis. However, the results also indicate high future potentials of AI in SF. Experts agree that AI will have a high impact on SF, mainly in terms of automatizing information research and data analysis tasks and subsequently allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks in SF which require human abilities like intuition, creativity, courage and entrepreneurial thinking.t.},

Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.},

This paper describes an exploratory analysis of the online activity in the official Learning Management System of 2nd-year students in a course at the Telecommunication Engineering Degree at the University of Vigo for three consecutive academic years. We conclude there is a correlation between the interaction of the students in the LMS and their final marks. Besides, we have obtained temporal behaviour patterns for successful and unsuccessful students. Thus, it is possible the early detection of students who are not interacting as they are supposed to do when following the course and, consequently, to trigger alarms for both students and professors. Besides, professors would have a good feedback system to improve the course design in short-term.},

On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), for a fraction of their computational and storage cost. This lightness of TPGs, both for training and inference, makes them an interesting model to implement Artificial Intelligences (AIs) on embedded systems with limited computational and storage resources. In this paper, we introduce the Gegelati library for TPGs. Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chipss (MPSoCss). 2/ The support for customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end 24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoCs. The impact of customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment.},

abstract = {The significance of mass media is that of setting news agenda and facilitating the public opinion on the basis of this agenda setting. Thus, the role of mass media is not only an intermediary body for disseminating information to the public, but also influence on the manner, in which people consider and view society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and manpower issues are deserved to setting news agenda because the issues are critical agenda of the current era. However, the previous literatures pointed out that newspaper coverages mainly covered with the business and industrial aspect of AI issues and less attention has been given to the analysis of specific frames from public opinion. Thus, this study aims to address the opinion of subscribers about newspaper coverage on AI and manpower issues. This study employs two approaches, quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results of quantitative analysis on topic model point to three frames, namely, humanity, society, and robotics. The study then applied these frames as the basis of qualitative analysis. Subscribers are mainly concerned about a lack of humanity and the violation of human dignity due to the implementation of AI. Additionally, subscribers discussed the manner, in which AI is changing the meaning of work. In terms of robotics, opinions were clearly polarized into positive and negative: Positive points mainly viewed the benefits of robots, such as addressing the shortage in labors, eliminating heavy labor, becoming friends with human beings, among others. Conversely, the negative opinions mainly associated with the fear against robots. This study suggested that the government needs to utilize means of implementation to mitigate the user's sense of aversion against AI. Additionally, the government needs to delineate the future society toward co-existence and cooperation between machine and humans.},

abstract = {Today's digitalization has become a staple of life, and consumers' escalating digital lifestyles and demand for convenient services are directly driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. The car will no longer be a single-function transport but will become an intelligent mobile terminal providing mobility services. The influx of digital services into the car will result in a dramatic transformation of the relationship between the driver and the car, where the car will act as an intelligent mobile terminal to transfer and communicate information with people or the surrounding environment, which will lead to an explosion of information in the car, and due to the limitations of human information processing capabilities, this may make the currently established design of human-computer interaction in the car no longer applicable. If we continue to view the human-vehicle relationship through the lens of a control-oriented machine interface, this will place strong constraints on the design of intelligent human-vehicle interaction. The core of the future intelligent vehicle HCI field is a richer and more diverse information interaction between vehicle, human, and environment, so changing the concept from HCI to human-vehicle information interaction may well support the development of future intelligent vehicle systems. In this article, the exploitation of a human-vehicle interaction assistance system for the handover of control of a vehicle under conditional automation is used as an example to discuss how human information interaction is applicable to the automotive domain.},

Over the last decade, a rather large number of maturity models have been suggested for different aspects (such as type of technology or considered processes) and in relation to different industries. Usually, these models are based on a number of assumptions such as the data used for the assessment, the mathematical formulation of the model and various parameters such as weights or importance indicators. Empirical evidence for such assumptions is usually lacking. We investigate the potential of using data from assessments over time and for similar institutions for the ML of respective models. Related concepts are worked out in some details and for some types of maturity assessment models, a possible application of the concept is discussed.},

abstract = {Accreditation agencies request evidence of the graduates learning outcomes during quality processes. Universities have to provide exhaustive empirical proof of their achievement and development through the academic training program, which is a significant challenge because it implies a substantial improvement and change of the educational model and evaluation method. There are still theoretical gaps to explain from an empirical perspective which elements of the university curriculum are associated with academic programs learning outcomes. The lack of empirical evidence prevents us from identifying which factors are associated with an efficient achievement of learning results in higher education institutions to implement improvement actions based on valid and objective data. In this context, learning analytics is a valuable tool that can support collecting, measuring, analyzing, and reporting data to understand the different factors involved in the educational process and their influence on learning. The primary purpose of this study is to answer how to define and validate a multivariate metamodel based on the factors involved in learning outcomes and academic performance results. In this article, we present the objectives and their phases, activities, procedures, and instruments to achieve the goal of the study. We expect to validate a metamodel on a large-scale population with different academic engineering programs at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.},

abstract = {The core of this paper is to provide a framework for analyzing the naturalness and artificiality in terms of the new rising of square of opposition, which have fruitful results in doing conceptual analysis in many different disciplines. In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\"{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.},

Based on this, a Data Warehouse was created, and the original data was then extracted, transformed and loaded, and a Business Intelligence (BI) environment was deployed and set. This BI environment was utilized for carrying out several descriptive statistics analyses about the dropout phenomenon. Results showed differences in dropout rates in the dimensions of race, type of city where the course is located, type of institution (public or private), teaching modality (on-site or e-learning), year of entry into course, and course period. Thus, this paper increase the knowledge about IS courses and encourages discussion about dropout phenomenon.},

The goals of the pilot program are to increase interest in AI, contextualize technically rigorous AI concepts through societal impact, and address barriers that could discourage 10th grade girls from pursuing computer science. In this paper we describe the curriculum designed to achieve these goals. Survey results show students had a statistically significant increase in technical knowledge, interest in pursuing careers in AI, and confidence in succeeding in AI and computer science. Additionally, survey results show that the majority of the students found new role models, faculty support, and a sense of community in AI and computer science.},

Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.},

abstract = {With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence, there are abundant types of learning resources and various learning methods. The use of digital resources in the context of the Internet in learning can stimulate students’ interest in English learning, improve their English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and effectively improve the efficiency of junior high school English classroom learning. Different people have different learning effects in the same learning environment because their own qualities are certainly one factor, and the more important factor is the different attitudes of the learners, that is, whether the learners are interested in learning. Interest can arouse students’ curiosity and eager thirst for knowledge, and interest can promote students’ active learning, spontaneous learning, and diligent learning more than intelligence and skills. For the English learning of junior high school students, interest is the first condition for them to learn English well. Only when students are interested in English learning, can they actively participate in English learning, and gradually become more and more interested in the specific English learning process. Through the questionnaire survey of middle school students, we can understand their tendency to attribute to English learning performance in the process of English learning. This paper aims to investigate whether middle school students are more interested in English, the higher their English scores will be, and whether male and female students are different in their interest in English. In this way, in the process of English teaching, attribution theory can be used to combine students' reality and their own experience to guide and train students in attribution so that they can form correct attributions. At the same time, this paper has a certain guiding role for workers engaged in English education for middle school students. It can help them understand the attribution tendency of middle school students in the process of English learning and give middle school students correct attribution guidance and training, thus improving teachers’ English teaching performance.},

abstract = {In the era of Energy Internet, prefecture and municipal power supply companies are faced with a large number of underlying terminal equipment. Traditional manual detection of vulnerabilities has the disadvantages of low batch processing efficiency and unstable vulnerability detection rate. This article combines vulnerability mining and artificial intelligence, using bidirectional LSTM network. Feature learning is used as the core algorithm of the automatic vulnerability mining module, and has been applied in practice in the world-class urban power distribution network demonstration project in the ancient city of Suzhou. The application results show that the terminal vulnerability mining system based on artificial intelligence can greatly improve the automatic discovery ability and analysis efficiency of terminal equipment high-risk vulnerabilities, and can effectively improve the defects of traditional methods that cannot be batched and modularized.},

abstract = {In the application field of professional translation and localization market, since the quality of computer translation basically meets actual needs, most of the translation products that can be sold in the market use computer-assisted translation technology. However, due to the complexity and variability of linguistic knowledge, some people have proposed translation memory, which makes full use of the powerful functions of files and databases to improve the reliability and reuse of existing translation materials. Therefore, in some professional translation technology applications with high data and repetitiveness, the use of this type of technology can effectively eliminate the double operation of translators, avoid multiple translation results of the same word or two words, and significantly improve its work efficiency. This article is based on artificial intelligence-based English translation memory and terminology establishment and design. First of all, it uses literature research to explain the functions of English translation memory technology and English translation screening methods. After analyzing the memory and terminology, according to analyzing the results of the design of the memory bank and the design library, this article locates the granularity of the memory bank at the simple sentence level, and establishes a correspondence between the various components of a sentence based on the establishment of a simple word-sentence alignment. The English sentence similarity algorithm based on syntax and semantics can well measure the structural and semantic similarity between two English sentences, and can correctly return the most similar example sentences in a memory bank. After we obtained the most similar example sentences, we translated them according to the corresponding relationship between the sentence to be translated and the various components of the most similar example sentences.},

abstract = {Human creativity has been often aided and supported by artificial tools, spanning traditional tools such as ideation cards, pens, and paper, to computed and software. Tools for creativity are increasingly using artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report on two progressive – not comparative – autoethnographic studies to attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator.},

So that it can give full play to its ability in the fierce market competition and achieve the best economic benefits. Robots have some sensory functions, such as sense of touch, smell and so on, which enable robots to process information of different signals autonomously. Inspired by the ant colony's foraging behavior of finding the shortest path, this paper proposes a simulated evolutionary algorithm artificial ant colony algorithm, which simulates the behavior of ant colony in nature. Ant colony algorithm has been concerned by many experts and scholars, and is being studied by more and more experts and scholars. The algorithm is continuously improved, and the application scope is more and more extensive. It is a bionic optimization algorithm with good development prospects. This paper mainly introduces the basic principle and basic model of ant colony algorithm.

However, as tasks and experimental setups vary due to different objectives, some studies report improved user decision-making performance through XAI, while others report only negligible effects. Therefore, in this article, we present an initial synthesis of existing research on XAI studies using a statistical meta-analysis to derive implications across existing research. We observe a statistically positive impact of XAI on users' performance. Additionally, the first results indicate that human-AI decision-making tends to yield better task performance on text data. However, we find no effect of explanations on users' performance compared to sole AI predictions. Our initial synthesis gives rise to future research investigating the underlying causes and contributes to further developing algorithms that effectively benefit human decision-makers by providing meaningful explanations.},

abstract = {Since the reform and opening up, Chinese manufacturing enterprises have actively participated in the global value chain division of labor, and their international competitiveness has been continuously strengthened. However, due to the lack of core technologies and market channels, manufacturing enterprises are still at the low end of the global value chain. Artificial intelligence can be deeply integrated with manufacturing enterprises by combining with Internet big data technology. It can promote the global value chain upgrade of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Based on this background, this paper first analyzes the reasons for the low-end locking of the value chain of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, which are due to the locking of comparative advantage, foreign technology and brand market. Then, this paper combs the theoretical mechanism of artificial intelligence promoting the upgrading of global value chain of manufacturing enterprises. Artificial intelligence can upgrade the global value chain by reducing the production cost of manufacturing enterprises, improving the effect of technological innovation and the efficiency of information circulation. Finally, this paper sorts out the concrete measures of applying artificial intelligence technology to manufacturing enterprises in China, and emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence for upgrading the global value chain of manufacturing enterprises [1].},

abstract = {In the first part I present a theoretical study of ethical challenges arising from the development and application of AI, while in the second part I present an empirical study of public attitudes towards the various aspects of AI use, which I have conducted. Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems that mimic human cognitive functions and that are designed to achieve specific goals, execute tasks, make decisions or achieve goals in complex situations autonomously.AI can greatly facilitate people's daily and business lives, but it also brings challenges, such as privacy, transparency, discrimination, job loss, and responsibility. One of the main challenges related to the adoption and implementation of AI is the current connotations and perceptions of the subject. To some people, AI is a mysterious concept, and it is difficult to understand how it manifests in their daily lives. The development and application of AI raise several ethical issues, including the interaction of AI with human rights such as privacy and discrimination [2]. Previous studies [1, 3-5] have examined some aspects of AI. In this study, I have employed a new scale to measure the general attitudes of the public towards AI.I have conducted an empirical study of public attitudes towards various aspects of the use of AI. The participants were the public in Serbia (N=737) who filled out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of general socio-demographic questions, questions about familiarity with AI, a brief introduction to the concept of AI, and questions about participants' attitudes towards the use of AI. Participants were asked to what degree they (dis)agree with the statements on the 5-point Likert scale. I have investigated whether age, education, previous knowledge of AI, profession, and level of religiosity influences people's attitudes towards AI. Objectives were to (1) examine the public's attitudes in Serbia toward the use of AI; (2) determine which factors influence these attitudes; (3) examine whether the public shares the concerns identified by ethical philosophers in the debates on AI; (4) examine prior knowledge of the public on AI. Data were analyzed in the R programming language. The general attitude towards the use of AI was assessed by creating a composite score based on the questions in which the respondents expressed their attitudes towards different aspects of the use of AI.The results showed that the public in Serbia has a divided opinion on the use of AI. Half of them have positive, and the other half negative attitudes. These attitudes are influenced by variables such as the respondents' age, education, profession, level of religiosity, and prior knowledge of AI, in a way that young, highly educated, non-religious, those with highly qualified jobs, especially IT professionals, and those who are more familiar with the concept of AI, have more positive attitudes towards the use of AI. Also, the results showed that the public is concerned about the disappearance of professions due to the development of AI and discrimination by AI systems. The results suggest a need to educate the public about challenges and ways to prevent them. It is necessary to increase transparency in decision-making processes related to the implementation of AI and dialogue between the public on the one hand and the state and the private sector on the other. I argue that considering different aspects of public attitudes toward AI enhances this debate. The results are valuable for future work on this topic because similar public opinion polls have not been conducted, especially not in Serbia. Public opinion has not shaped conversations about the use of AI. Another focus should be on further research of the attitudes of the public and experts on specific applications of AI and related ethical challenges. This research has implications for future research, particularly when forming an AI attitude scale.},

abstract = {Scientific writing is one of the most difficult linguistic abilities to master. Many individuals find it difficult to master writing skills. This study aims to facilitate students in writing scientific papers. The ability to write scientific papers is one of the skills that every student should develop since it will help them complete their final assignment. As a result, a lecturer should produce scholars with exceptional academic knowledge as well as powerful and clever personalities. This is a preliminary study of the current situation. In the learning process of the Indonesian Language general course, a qualitative method was employed to enhance students' scientific writing skills. The research data were the students’ writing, which includes rational and empirical data. It can be solved by combining learning with local wisdom in scientific paper writing to encourage students to develop their scientific writing skills and understanding of text structures precisely. This study also aims to enhance scientific writing skills by incorporating students in independent research as part of a lesson plan. Based on the findings, this method has proven to be effective in improving students' scientific writing skills, so it needs to continue to be developed in the general course of Indonesian Language learning and is expected to be the right alternative for the lecturers to develop professional skills.},

As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following "blue sky" questions:1. How could/should Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses incorporate ethics into the curriculum?2. How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level?3. AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields?This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate discussion around these issues in AI education.},

abstract = {The use of artificial intelligence in government and its implications to society have generated widespread interest from research and practice communities. However, the analysis of artificial intelligence techniques as a tool to support government decision-making in specific functions is still scarce. For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.},

The survey was addressed at practitioners of public administrations at central, regional, and local level and aimed to compile a collection of cases of AI-enabled solutions used by public sector administrations. It analyses the drivers, obstacles, opportunities, and influencing factors of AI adoption and use by European public sector administrations, and identifies the perceived impacts of AI-enabled solutions on the different beneficiaries/users of services provided by public sector administrations. Findings from 62 respondents show that there is a wide array of AI initiatives in the public sector in European Member States moving beyond the pilot stage, that there is lack of citizen involvement in the design of AI services, low digital literacy of employees using AI systems, and that the disrupting effect that AI is expected to have in the public sector is still not mirrored in concrete large-scale AI projects with wide impact on public affairs.},

abstract = {AI has the potential to revolutionize many areas of healthcare. Radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology are some of the areas most likely to be impacted in the near future, and they have received significant attention from the broader research community. But AI techniques are now also starting to be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF), in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but must be done carefully and transparently, as the ethical issues are significant, in part because this field involves creating new people. We first give a brief introduction to IVF and review the use of AI for embryo selection. We discuss concerns with the interpretation of the reported results from scientific and practical perspectives. We then consider the broader ethical issues involved. We discuss in detail the problems that result from the use of black-box methods in this context and advocate strongly for the use of interpretable models. Importantly, there have been no published trials of clinical effectiveness, a problem in both the AI and IVF communities, and we therefore argue that clinical implementation at this point would be premature. Finally, we discuss ways for the broader AI community to become involved to ensure scientifically sound and ethically responsible development of AI in IVF.},

abstract = {Our CS0.5 course is required for all students and tasked to develop and assess the system development process proficiencies of an engineering-based institutional outcome. To achieve this tasking, we created a course-wide project that simulates NASA's Mars Ingenuity helicopter using an approach that emphasized our software system development process. With this project, our first-year college students created a 2-dimensional simulation of the Ingenuity helicopter flying through the thin Martian atmosphere with the goal of maximizing the area mapped subject to flight dynamics, available battery, landing proximity, and impact constraints. Students created their Ingenuity simulator using Python in three spirals: Spiral 1 - rendering of the simulation view with some initial movement, Spiral 2 - manual flight operations via thrust and roll keyboard inputs, and Spiral 3 - full auto-pilot. The students utilized a software system development process called "UDIT" (pronounced, "U Did IT") which stands for Understand - Design - Implement - Test. The assignment document was purposefully organized based on this process. The Understand and Design steps were presented via storyboards, enumerated requirements, a recommended structure chart, pseudocode, and suggested variables. As the Understand and Design steps address higher order objectives on Bloom's Taxonomy, we strived to model effective approaches for these steps. Most of our novice programmer's efforts involved the Implementation and Test steps emphasizing a build-a-little, test-a-little strategy. Forty percent of points come from testing via test procedures that the students created. The remaining points were earned based on code correctness and quality. The course also introduced the students to Artificial Intelligence to contribute to another proficiency of the engineering institutional outcome. For this, the project introduced students to genetic algorithms. They learned how the algorithm's parameters can be configured to train a more sophisticated version of the autopilot that needed to deal with additional Ingenuity features, including altitude-dependent mapping, as well as randomness in the form of varying winds at different altitudes. Currently being used with 450 students across 22 sections, the project is being assessed by sub-score tracking across the spirals; students' self-assessments of learning, interest, and self-efficacy; and collection of instructors' experiences and perceptions on the project.},

Despite thumbnails' omnipresence and their assumed effect on sales, they largely constitute a black box for research and practice. This work aims to fill this gap and asks, with regard to hedonic information goods: What is the role of thumbnails in the purchase process and how and why do their basic, conceptual and social features impact sales? To answer the question, we first analytically and empirically show that thumbnails play a more central role in the purchase process for hedonic information goods than for other types of goods. Next, we develop a variance model on how and why thumbnails affect sales. Using artificial intelligence imagery analysis, we test the model against evidence from sales data of 100,000 hedonic information goods from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings entail theoretical contributions to the growing field of consumers' visual information processing in e-commerce contexts and lead us to implications for managerial practice.},

The simulation models have been exercised in order to generate enough information about the future expansion. This information has been used to develop neural networks that have the capability to indicate the volume of the Gatun Lake and its respective salinity taking into consideration lockages, spillovers, hydropower generation, fresh water supply volumes, and environmental factors such as precipitation, tides, and evaporation. Support vector machines were used to build time series regression models of the evaporation of Gatun Lake.},

However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.},

abstract = {Growing up in an artificial intelligence-filled world, with Siri and Amazon Alexa often within arm’s—or speech’s—reach, could have significant impact on children. Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students’ perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops’ influence on student perceptions of Alexa’s intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students’ perceptions of Alexa’s friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence technology has gradually become an important auxiliary means for people to obtain medical consultation. However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust. At the end of this paper, some suggestions are put forward to design an interpretable and reliable intelligent self diagnosis system.},

abstract = {As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow globally, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains the primary strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. In this study, an Artificial Intelligence model for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV) is developed to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependencies among features and improves model performance while an attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. We used several publicly available datasets of both computed tomography (CT) and X-ray modalities. The main public dataset for chest X-ray images contains 475 COVID-19 samples, 3949 samples from other viral/bacterial infections, and 1583 normal samples. Our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.4%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.8%, a specificity of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.8% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on that dataset. Using a large dataset of CT images, our model obtained mean cross-validation accuracy and sensitivity of 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Additionally, our interpretable model can distinguish subtle signs of infection within each radiography image. Assuming these results hold up in larger datasets obtained from a variety of patients over the world, AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19, prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers, and highlight the areas in the lungs that show signs of COVID-related damage.},

The proper development of organizational culture is expected to support the movement agility and innovation power of the Faculty of Engineering in facing the 4.0 higher education era. This research aims to map the organizational culture in the Faculty of Engineering Diponegoro University and assess the readiness of Adhocracy cultural implementation in accordance with the character of higher Education 4.0. Organizational culture mapping used OCAI instrument (Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument), while readiness assessment of Adhocracy culture implementation used gap analysis method. Based on the results of the mapping, the current organizational culture's scores hierarchy (27.79). Meanwhile, the expected organizational culture scored clan culture (27.39). The organizational culture of higher Education 4.0 is dynamic, entrepreneurial and creative. The organizational culture is a character of adhocracy culture. To prepare Adhocracy cultural implementation in engineering faculty gap analysis was conducted by comparing between the existing culture (hierarchy) and the expected culture (Adhocracy). Result of gap analysis indicated value 70.5%, which meant that faculty of engineering still needed organizational culture adjustments to welcome the higher education policy 4.0. The Faculty of Engineering needs to conduct activities that support the development of Adhocracy culture such as character building, new literacy, Infrastructure 4.0, and others.},

To engage in any project related to emotion detection, you must collect available models, data sets, and performance statistics related to it. The purpose of this review analysis is to integrate a unique and advanced set of methods proposed and/or implemented by everyone in the field. The research work of this paper mainly focuses on two aspects of classification, one is the classification based on research objects, the other is the classification based on research methods. The research object is mainly the difference between short text and normal text. The research methods mainly focus on machine learning, such as deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It can be seen from the comparison results that depth learning training is the best at a specific number of layers. If the number of layers is too many or too few, it will lead to insufficient accuracy or a waste of training time. Finally, this paper also puts forward feasible future research directions to provide readers with reference.},

The academic research efforts on AI have followed a trend of development of complex and resource-intensive algorithms that require cloud-centric architectures while the industrial architectures for data acquisition are in most cases distributed, fragmented and resource-constrained. Recent researches have demonstrated the need of moving toward a decentralized use of AI where data analysis algorithms are executed directly on the machine side ("on the edge"). As this is the future, it becomes evident that a new generation of AI and ML experts, able to adapt these technologies to the industrial needs and to foster their role as the key players of the 4th industrial revolution, is needed. The talk will present the activities of the PLANET4 project that aims at filling the gap between scientific research on AI and its industrial application by designing an innovative blended course.},

This capability enhances human interactions to a great extent. As we move towards the age of increasing Human-Machine Interaction systems, we must strive to program our machines to achieve the so-called social and emotional capabilities algorithmically. A primary research frontier in emotion detection is recognizing it using facial images. Being able to recognize the emotions of a human being helps the machine adjust and tune itself to the human's needs and comfort. Emotion detection can be performed using various modalities such as video, audio, images, text, biometric information, etc. This study, explores the emerging trends in emotion recognition through facial images. Automated recognition of emotions of people has the potential to predict psychiatric illness or other latent mental health issues.},

Further considering the X-architecture and the routing resources within obstacles, an effective performance-driven X-architecture routing algorithm for AI chip design in smart manufacturing is proposed to improve the delay performance of the chip. First, a special particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the discrete length-restricted X-architecture Steiner minimum tree problem in combination with genetic operations, and a particle encoding scheme is presented to encode each particle into an initial routing tree. Second, two lookup tables based on pins and obstacles are established to provide a fast information query for the whole algorithm flow. Third, a strategy of candidate point selection is designed to make the particles satisfy the constraints. Finally, a refinement strategy is implemented to further improve the quality of the final routing tree. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a better total wirelength, which is an important index of performance, thus better satisfying the demand for delay performance of AI chip design in smart manufacturing.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend being implemented in the public sector. Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.},

abstract = {As a social dance, sports dance is a form of communication between countries, and it is also an art that cannot be replaced by language. Since it was introduced to China, the speed of development in China has been extremely rapid, and sports dance training institutions have gradually developed throughout the country. However, traditional dance learning and dance communication are basically restricted to dance classrooms, resulting in a limited range of communication, fewer objects to communicate, and excellent dance experience and dance resources cannot be shared, which is not conducive to the improvement of the personal level of dancers. Based on the above reasons, the research on dance training is of great significance. This article first introduces the current status of dance training, and then uses artificial intelligence technology to design and implement a virtual dance training system. Finally, a final test is conducted on the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system. The test results show the virtual dance training system designed in this paper. The dance training system is stable and easy to use.},

abstract = {Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.},

abstract = {Upcoming regional and National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources will give researchers opportunities to run their artificial intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) workflows on accelerators. To effectively leverage this burgeoning CI-rich landscape, researchers need extensive benchmark data to maximize performance gains and map their workflows to appropriate architectures. This data will further assist CI administrators, NSF program officers, and CI allocation-reviewers make informed determinations on CI-resource allocations. Here, we compare the performance of two very different architectures: the commonly used Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the new generation of Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs), by running training benchmarks of common AI/ML models. We leverage the maturity of software stacks, and the ease of migration among these platforms to learn that performance and scaling are similar for both architectures. Exploring training parameters, such as batch size, however finds that owing to memory processing structures, IPUs run efficiently with smaller batch sizes, while GPUs benefit from large batch sizes to extract sufficient parallelism in neural network training and inference. This comes with different advantages and disadvantages as discussed in this paper.As such considerations of inference latency, inherent parallelism and model accuracy will play a role in researcher selection of these architectures. The impact of these choices on a representative image compression model system is discussed.},

That is why we have developed LearningML, aiming to provide a platform that supports educators and students in the creation of hands-on AI projects, specifically based on machine learning techniques. In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online. In order to assess the AI knowledge we created a test that includes different kinds of questions based on previous investigations and publications - resulting in a reliable assessment instrument. Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments. In addition, researchers and educators can make use of the new instrument we provide to evaluate future educational interventions.},

In this work, we present the results of an exploratory case study with 20 construction workers in a small Austrian company about their knowledge of and attitudes toward AI. Our results show that construction workers’ understanding of AI as a concept is rather superficial, diffuse, and vague, often linked to physical and tangible entities such as robots, and often based on inappropriate sources of information which can lead to misconceptions about AI and AI anxiety. Learning opportunities for promoting (future) construction workers’ AI literacy should be accessible and understandable for learners at various educational levels and encompass aspects such as i) conveying the basics of digitalization, automation, and AI to enable a clear distinction of these concepts, ii) building on the learners’ actual experience realm, i.e., taking into account their focus on physical, tangible, and visible entities, and iii) reducing AI anxiety by elaborating on the limits of AI.},

abstract = {With the development of my country's economy and society, especially the development of the global economy under the conditions of informatization, professional talents have made obvious contributions to economic and social development. Colleges and universities (CU) have initially established a training model for accounting professionals (APS) in line with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, problems in the training of accounting talents (AT) have also emerged. How the talents trained in the accounting profession can better satisfy the needs of social development, especially the needs of corporate development, has not been solved very effectively for a long time. At present, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on education is deepening, and artificial intelligence technology (AIT) is also promoting the transformation of talent training in CU. This article mainly uses questionnaire survey method and data analysis method to study the transformation and practice of accounting professional (AP) training in CU, and is intended to explore the transformation of AP training in CU under the blessing of AIT. Analyzed the opinions of college accounting students on the AP curriculum, and the practical teaching content that they think needs to be strengthened in professional learning. According to the survey results, most interviewees believe that there are problems with the curriculum, too many theoretical classes and fewer practical classes; practical teaching content that needs to be strengthened includes comprehensive training and practical production internships in the school, paying more attention to their own knowledge and practical ability to meet the needs of work. Therefore, the transformation of the training of APS in CU is an inevitable trend.},

abstract = {South Africa needs vital skills in engineering and technology to address future financial, environmental, educational and health challenges. In this era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is even more important to use cloud technology in classrooms in Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in the South African context. This paper looks at uses of cloud technology, ease of use and intentions of using cloud technology in the classroom in a South African HEI. Questionnaires were given to students at an HEI for collecting data about the study. The research was undertaken to determine how cloud technologies can be used within HEIs particularly engineering education to support teaching and learning functions. The research is unique because many institutions have adopted the use of Learning Management Systems such as Blackboard, whereas in this study we explored the use of a cloud-integrated approach that requires no extra cost to the university or the student. A quantitative approach was used and regression analysis was performed to predict the possible outcome based on the variable. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient shows that there was a statistically significant relationship between the perceived ease of use and the intentions to use cloud technology.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in cactus cultivation because of numerous cacti uses from houseplants to food and medicinal applications. Various diseases impact the growth of cacti. To develop an automated model for the analysis of cactus disease and to be able to quickly treat and prevent damage to the cactus. The Faster R-CNN and YOLO algorithm technique were used to analyze cactus diseases automatically distributed into six groups: 1) anthracnose, 2) canker, 3) lack of care, 4) aphid, 5) rusts and 6) normal group. Based on the experimental results the YOLOv5 algorithm was found to be more effective at detecting and identifying cactus disease than the Faster R-CNN algorithm. Data training and testing with YOLOv5S model resulted in a precision of 89.7% and an accuracy (recall) of 98.5%, which is effective enough for further use in a number of applications in cactus cultivation. Overall the YOLOv5 algorithm had a test time per image of only 26 milliseconds. Therefore, the YOLOv5 algorithm was found to suitable for mobile applications and this model could be further developed into a program for analyzing cactus disease.},

When implementing AI in robotic systems, there are roughly two approaches; one is AI implemented in a robotic system that controls the system independently, and the other is external AI located somewhere else that controls the system in a tele-operated manner. An investigation was thus conducted into how people judge moral wrongness in a system and in its designers and owners regarding these two different types of AI and action consequences. The result showed that the owners of the systems were judged as "morally wrong" at higher rates compared with the systems and designers regardless of the type of AI and action consequences},

abstract = {Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.},

abstract = {Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, accounting for one-third of all congenital birth defects. As with complicated intracardiac structural abnormalities, CHD is usually treated with surgical repair, and computed tomography (CT) is the main examination method for diagnosis of CHD and also provides anatomical information to surgeons. Currently, there exists a serious shortage of professional surgeons in developing countries. Compared with developed countries where large hospitals and cardiovascular disease centers have professional surgical teams with rich treatment experience, surgeons in developing countries and remote areas suffer from lack of professional surgical skills resulting with low surgical quality and high mortality. Recently, surgical telementoring has been popular to tackle the above problems, in which less-skilled surgeons can get real-time guidance from skilled surgeons remotely through audio and video transmission. However, there still exists difficulties in applying telementoring to CHD surgeries including high resource consumption on medical data transmission and storage, large image noise, and inconvenient and inefficient discussion between surgeons on CT. In this article, we proposed a framework with an image compression module, an image denoising module, and an image segmentation module based on CT images in CHD. We evaluated the above three modules and compared them with existing works, respectively, and the results show that our methods achieve much better performance. Furthermore, with 3D printing, VR technology, and 5G communications, our framework was successfully used in a real case study to treat a patient who needed surgical treatment.},

abstract = {Ethics and privacy issues have been recognized as important factors for acceptance and trustworthy implementation of learning analytics. A large number of different issues has been recognized in the literature. Guidelines related to these issues are continuously being developed and discussed in research literature. The aim of this research was to identify patterns of co-occurrence of issues and guidelines in research papers discussing ethics and privacy issues, to gain better understanding of relationships between different ethics and privacy issues arising during implementation of learning analytics in higher education. A total of 93 papers published between 2010 and 2021 were qualitatively analyzed, and nine categories of issues and respective guidelines related to ethics and privacy in learning analytics were identified. Association rules mining Apriori algorithm was applied, where 93 papers represented transactions, and 18 categories of issues or guidelines (nine each) represented items. Two clusters of issues co-occurring in papers were identified, corresponding to deontology ethics (related to rules and duties), and consequentialism ethics (related to consequences of unethical behavior).},

However, people's trust and acceptance of AI are highly susceptible to when and how the suggestion is presented. This study examined the role of the message framing and timing on acceptance when the performance of AI is stated. The study employed a 2 (message timing: before vs. after decision) x 3 (message framing: no information vs. negative framing vs. positive framing) between-subjects experiment where participants were told to solve the specific problem with AI in different conditions. The results showed that participants perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable and accepted it more when the performance is not stated than any information is provided and they perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable when the message is presented before the decision is made. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The adaptive immune system expresses millions of different receptors that detect and fight pathogens encountered throughout life. These receptors are encoded by unique DNA sequences that allow immune cells to express millions of different receptors. High-throughput sequencing and analyses of immune cell receptor sequences present a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological responses to infections and to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Even after the infection is eliminated, pathogen-specific immune cells and their receptor sequences are present at higher frequencies than prior to infection, and their increase in frequency prevents secondary infections. As a result of their persistence in the body, they may be useful for diagnosing infections and evaluating vaccine efficacy as a stable biomarker. However, this process requires thorough analysis of massive datasets at an accuracy beyond traditional statistical tests to diagnose infectious statuses based on sequence analyses. Here we evaluate various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to measure the performance of the identification and diagnosis of specific viral infections or vaccination statuses using the publicly available mouse (monkeypox infection and smallpox vaccination) and human (cytomegalovirus serostatus) T-cell receptor sequenced datasets. Our intensive experiments hold the potential for effective screening of disease status, including recently encountered strains like the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.},

abstract = {The key challenges of the financial industry are the volatility and complexity of the stock market, so how to make optimal trading strategy to maximize the total profit in all market conditions has become an important issue to the professional researchers and investors. This paper describes a hybrid stock trading strategy model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm and sample entropy (SE), combined with LSTM, are used to construct the integrated prediction model, which has dramatically improved the forecast precision. On the premise of accurate prediction, the extreme value theory (EVT) is introduced to improve the predictive ability of dynamic value at risk (VaR), which can manage the risk of portfolio. To forecast stock trends, the approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to assign weights to related factors. The final trading decisions are made by establishing trading signals and scoring models. Based on models above, the integrated trading strategy model is constructed as an automated trading decision tool. Taking Gold and Crude oil as examples, the profit results are proved to be decent through trading simulations.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the framework adopted by the global community to encourage taking actions on the multiple challenges facing the world today to ensure environmental protection, health and well-being, and economic prosperity. This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDGs related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics. In this paper, we present the SDG Data Catalog, a global open-source database indexing SDG-related datasets, associated metadata, and research networks. We describe the construction of this catalog, which relies on state-of-the-art natural language processing models with human supervision. The catalog breaks down data silos and helps sustainability researchers navigate the data sea to initiate effective collaborations.},

Meanwhile, a lot of experimental cases show that people can finish 2 tasks at the same time if one is familiar with one task or by shifting the thinking quickly, thus "multitasking" is achieved. And intelligent interaction based on how the attention distribute has become one of the current development trends. According to 3 types of interactions based on the progressive decreasing of attention requirement, we provide a standardized definition to the interaction design, and extract the typical proposals. Attention is one factor when a user is thinking his/her preferred interaction. It is proved that, compared with the traditional "undivided attention", "multitasking" is more flexibility in dealing with problems. It is an essential thinking ability evolved for human to adapt to the development of science and technology and improve the social productivity.},

abstract = {Under the background of artificial intelligence, the internal and external environment of enterprises has changed dramatically, the market environment presents the characteristics of dynamic, complexity and competitiveness, the organizational structure has changed, and the team has increasingly become a common working mode in enterprises. As an important ability to generate novel and useful ideas, team creativity is an important source of organizational innovation and competitive advantage. The relationship between leadership style and team creativity has always been a hot topic in the field of organizational behavior. How to stimulate team creativity is still an important problem to be solved in the innovation and development of enterprises. This paper takes the R &amp; D team of scientific and technological enterprises as the research object, takes "input-process-output" (I-P-O, as an abbreviation of input-processing-output) as the analysis paradigm, takes the leadership empowerment behavior as the antecedent variable, the team interaction process as the intermediary variable, and the team creativity as the outcome variable, This paper puts forward the transmission path of "leadership empowerment behavior - team interaction process - team creativity", and verifies the intermediary role of team interaction process between leadership empowerment behavior and team creativity.},

abstract = {The LINEN Assessment application is an application developed to measure the capacity of students in Indonesia in terms of literacy, numeracy and entrepreneurial mindset. To be able to get an automatic profiling picture and be able to provide more accurate predictions, the application was developed based on artificial intelligence. This study aims to provide an overview of the integration of artificial intelligence that is carried out to be applied in the process of developing the LINEN Assessment application. The research method used is the Neuroresearch research method. Through the three stages in this method, namely exploratory, explanatory and confirmatory research, the research process is carried out to produce a research construct as the basis for compiling a standard and valid LINEN Assessment instrument. The application development stage itself uses the waterfall method, specifically through the agile development method. The results of the study are illustrated by the presence of several diagrams showing the integration process carried out. The description of the LINEN Assessment application also shows that the LINEN Assessment Apps were developed with the concept of self-assessment and diagnostic-assessment to equip students with fundamental skills and competencies that are important for their future. One of these important foundations is when students have basic skills, namely literacy, numeracy and skills that refer to innovative creative power, namely entrepreneurial mindset skills. Students can independently use smartphones to explore their own profiles and explore learning experiences through the LINEN Assessment application.},

abstract = {Engagement of learners in computer-based tutoring constitutes an important feature that is sought by learning applications to maximise the educational effectiveness. Moreover, the recognition of human emotions in interactive computer-based learning applications has also been considered important although it had been overlooked for many years in the past. In view of these, dynamic personalisation and a variety of artificial intelligence techniques offer new perspectives, insights and realistic results in rendering computer-based learning more human-like and engaging than it has ever been before. This talk will present and discuss research challenges and effective approaches towards a new era of personalisation and human-like behaviour of computer-based learning software. I will review the research advancements on this topic that have been achieved in the software engineering lab of our department. In particular, the talk will focus on the automatic analysis of computer observations in computer-based learning that are collected, taking input from at least three modalities of interaction, namely the keyboard, camera and microphone in conjunction with contextual information and are then used to draw inferences about the users' cognitive status, reasoning, social classmate behaviour, preferences and emotions. In return, the tutoring content and the user interface is automatically adapted accordingly to address the individual user's needs by making appropriate recommendations and presenting adaptive guidance. Contextual information differs depending on the kind of computer- based learning applications. As such, a diversity of paradigms of fully developed and evaluated computer-based learning systems, in our lab, will be presented and discussed to exemplify the above research in the context of virtual reality educational games, social network learning, mobile learning and multi-modal stand-alone learning, based on the combination of cognitive theories about human reasoning and emotions, machine learning algorithms, decision making theories and fuzzy logic. The talk will conclude by highlighting open research areas for further research.},

abstract = {Building energy usage prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation. Building energy prediction contributes significantly in global energy saving as it can help us to evaluate the building energy efficiency; to conduct building commissioning; and detect and diagnose building system faults. AI based methods are popular owing to its ease of use and high level of accuracy. This paper proposes a detailed review of AI based building energy prediction methods particularly, multiple linear regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Regression. In addition to the previously listed methods, this paper will focus on ensemble prediction models used for building energy prediction. Ensemble models improve the prediction accuracy by integrating several prediction models. The principles, applications, advantages, and limitations of these AI based methods are elaborated in this paper. Additionally, future directions of the research on AI based building energy prediction methods are discussed.},

In the medical field, scales are very important to the clinic, and many scales are used clinically to evaluate the severity and prognosis of diseases. The development of the scale requires a lot of effort, but the use of the traditional scale requires doctors to spend high learning costs to use and diagnose. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop an easy-to-use artificial intelligence-based intelligent testing platform for behavioral medicine scales. We analyze the behavioral medicine scale's norms (cutoff values), implementation procedures, assignments, scoring, score conversion, factors and conclusions and other attributes, and use object-oriented programming ideas to model behavioral medicine scales. Finally, according to this model, the behavioral medicine scale intelligent test platform is realized through C++ programming. Developed a test platform with multiple functions such as scale evaluation, scale import, scale management, user management, scale report reviews and printing, historical evaluation record statistical analysis and other functions, and it was carried out through the cerebrovascular disease scale and nursing scale verify. The platform has a certain general purpose and can be widely used in the development, verification and clinical application of the behavioral medicine scale assessment.},

It concentrates on administrative errors in unemployment insurance (UI) decisions, which give rise to a public values conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. This conflict is first described and then highlighted in the history of the US UI regime. Machine learning may not only mitigate this conflict but it may also help to combat fraud and reduce the backlog of claims associated with economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The article uses data about improper UI payments throughout the US from 2002 through 2018 to analyze the accuracy of random forests and deep learning models. We find that a random forest model using gradient descent boosting is more accurate, along several measures, than every deep learning model tested. This finding could be explained by the goodness-of-fit between the machine learning method and the available data. Alternatively, deep learning performance could be attenuated by necessary limits to publicly-accessible claims data.},

abstract = {The public sector holds enormous potential for the use of artificial intelligence, which is also recognized and supported by the government. To realize this potential, however, it is imperative that civil servants have the necessary knowledge to recognise and optimally exploit the application and utilisation possibilities of AI. Massive open online courses (MOOC) are a promising way to help civil servants gain that required knowledge. But how can such a course be designed to become accepted by this target group? In this paper, we present a human-centered development approach to develop a MOOC about AI for civil servants. Using an analysis of the target audience’s mental models, knowledge needs, and attitudes, we iteratively developed short learning units that ground the abstract AI topics in concrete case scenarios taken from the public sector. First results of an expert evaluation (expertise in adult education, public sector, and AI) look promising and further evaluations with the target group are planned.},

This study will adopt the transactions between the dealer and the consumer to match to a drama performance and quote actors as dealers, the audience as consumers, and the scene as physical stores and virtual access to the shopping environment. We applied purposive sampling towards consumers, who have had experiences in purchasing at chained apparel retail stores through either physical or virtual access, having collected 407 valid questionnaires in total. This study used the method of context simulation, and divided the consumers into two different sample groups based on different power influence. This study suggests to in the future the retailers use the consumer situation created by the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence to have consumers immersed in an environment that stimulates their purchase intention, as well as to arouse consumers' inner need, in order to increase the intention, frequency, and promotion price of consumers' purchasing behaviors.},

abstract = {With the popularization of medical information management and the development of various intelligent data collection and storage technologies, health-related data, such as monitoring data from smart wearable devices, clinical records from medical institutions, and exercise information from health apps Wait, these data are growing at an alarming rate. The main purpose of this article is to study the sports rehabilitation of patients with scoliosis under the background of big data. Through a large amount of literature analysis, this article summarizes the concept of scoliosis, the classification of scoliosis, and the etiology of scoliosis, which provides theoretical support for the study of sports rehabilitation methods for patients with scoliosis. In this article, while understanding the current research status of rehabilitation treatment for patients with scoliosis, I consulted a large number of research reports and cases of rehabilitation treatment for scoliosis patients at home and abroad, and learned that there are surgical treatment methods and non-operative treatments in the rehabilitation of idiopathic scoliosis. There are two surgical treatments, among which non-surgical treatments are more commonly used in adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis. In order to understand the practicality of corrective actions and the psychological feelings of patients, this article prepares corrective action experiments and satisfaction survey experiments for patients with scoliosis. Research experiments show that more than 75% of people are satisfied with scoliosis rehabilitation through exercise above 80 points, and patients are more recognized and accept the exercise rehabilitation model; most corrective actions are beneficial to patients with scoliosis Rehabilitation.},

The complexity and nonlinearity of PM10 concentration in the atmosphere are known best captured by the nonlinear model which emerges nowadays such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN). In order to assess the capability of MLP-NN model in predicting the PM10 concentration, a statistical or traditional model known as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was also developed as a reference model. The daily air quality data and meteorological variables from the year 2010-2014 were assembled in developing the models. The MLP-NN model with the combination of logsig and purelin activation function revealed 75.5% of the variance in data with 6.59 μg/m3 (RMSE) and 88.0% of the variance in data with 6.30 μg/m3 (RMSE), during training and testing phase, respectively. The MLP-NN model improves by 61.5% and reducing the 62.2% error as compared to the MLR model. This model is appropriate for operational used by respected authorities in managing air quality in maintaining sustainability and as an early warning during an unhealthy level of air quality.},

Teaching Software Engineering for undergraduate students is an assiduous and a challenging task due to its level of abstraction, to frequently changes that appear in programming paradigms and in software development methodologies. In this paper we provide a novel approach in teaching Advanced Programming Methods, the third introductory course in Software Engineering that is being taught at our faculty within the Computer Science Curriculum for undergraduate students. The contribution of this paper is threefold: firstly, we design a student-centered learning process intertwining cutting edge methods like for instance project-based learning, self assessment-based learning and students engagement. Secondly, we design an E-learning platform to provide for students an automated assessment and appropriate feedback and, most important, to offer them support throughout the learning process. Thirdly, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis over 3 years of teaching Advanced Programming Methods course, by applying the proposed methodology. Our analysis results show the effectiveness of our approach. Key contributions in this paper are our proposed E-learning platform and the analysis findings.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, damage identification in structural components has been the crucial concern in quality assessment and load capacity rating of infrastructure, as well as in the planning of a maintenance schedule. In this regard, structural health monitoring based on efficient tools to identify the damages in early stages has been focused by researchers to prevent sudden failure in structural components, ensure the public safety and reducing the asset management costs. Therefore, the development and application of sensing technologies and data analysis using machine learning approaches to enable the automatic detection of cracks have become very important. The purpose of this research is to develop a robust method for automatic condition assessment of real-life concrete structures for the detection of relatively small cracks at early stages. A damage identification approach is proposed using the parametric modeling and machine learning approaches to analyze the sensors data. The data obtained from transducers mounted on concrete beams under static loading in laboratory. These data are used as the input parameters. The method relies only on the measured time responses. After filtering and normalization of the data, Autoregressive all-pole model parameters (Yule-Walker method) are considered as features and used as the inputs of a newly developed Self-Advising Support Vector Machine (SA-SVM) for the classification purpose in civil Engineering area. Finally, the results are compared with traditional methods to investigate the feasibility of our proposed method. It is demonstrated that the presented method can reliably detect the crack in the structure and thereby enable the real-time infrastructure health monitoring.},

We found that people judge robot paintings and human paintings as art to roughly the same extent. However, people are much less willing to consider robots as artists than humans, which is partially explained by the fact that they are less disposed to attribute artistic intentions to robots.},

abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence techniques have shown tremendous potential as a decision support tool for government agencies. However, recent studies typically highlight the combination of large-scale datasets and high-performance computing technologies, which is frequently far away from the reality of many public agencies that still heavily rely on their legacy systems and labor-intensive practices. Using that non-ideal organizational and technical infrastructure, they have to face very complex problems and propose policy solutions. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of such problems. HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.},

By using the stratified sampling and cluster sampling, 41 TCM hospitals infection management full-time staff in Shaanxi Province were selected in January 2017 to investigate their general situation, job burnout and job stability, and to analyze the impact of job burnout on job stability, which combined a series of computer-based data analysis methods. The scores of job burnout and job stability for full-time infection management staff in TCM hospital were 44.55±13.69 and 16.48±3.79 respectively. The multiple regression analysis showed that job burnout could negatively predict job stability. Among them, job burnout and gender were the main influencing factors of job stability I (β= - 0.365. - 0.282, P&lt;0.05), job burnout was the main influencing factor of job stability II (β= - 0.430, P&lt;0.05). Job burnout of full-time infection management staff in TCM hospital is at a mild level, with good job stability. Job burnout has a great influence on the possibility of quitting the current job and the motivation of looking for other jobs of full-time infection management staff in TCM hospital.},

To keep up with this need, farmers and future farmers need to be trained in the ways of precision agriculture. With the widespread use of artificial intelligence across all industries, it is not surprising to find AI at the heart of precision agriculture. While AI has brought a lot of promise, it has also brought a lot of dread, due to the lack of understanding about what it is and what it can do. To help farmers buy into applying AI, a new educational program is needed. To this end, we have developed a simple active learning system to illustrate AI, particularly, machine learning. We present an overview of the system and discuss how it can contribute to future farmers' understanding of how AI works.},

abstract = {Despite all of the power that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models bring to applications, much of AI development is currently a fairly ad hoc process. Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. Our platform extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models.},

abstract = {In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.},

abstract = {The recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence, as well as the wide adoption of the wisdom of the crowd, also known as collective intelligence, across sectors, has received attention and excitement across disciplines. In addition to the scientific breakthrough, recent public sector studies recognize AI's potential contributions in public services, such as big data for decision making, the development of smart cities, and social and health care. Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature. Our study provides key themes and significance for each cluster. Our first examination of AI and crowd literature regarding connection to public values, complementary in public decision making, as well as future potential for joint adoption by governments provides some implications for future considerations.},

This work explores the value of relationships as a purposeful technique for achieving goals when no established process exists, issues are complex, or resources are scarce - scenarios which are all too familiar in Information Technology. A brief literature review sets the stage for gaining a better understanding of what drives various college and university environments and their organizational behavior models. Bases of Power are addressed as an academic concept related to influence tactics and their expected outcomes. Coupling an understanding of Higher Education cultural settings, power, and influence tactics we will examine how university decisions are made, and practical methods for directing those decisions towards desired outcomes within IT and throughout the campus communities we support. The value of relationships as an influence technique is established and strategies for how and when to cultivate relationships are discussed as they pertain to staff in diverse roles, from front-line support to CIO. Washington University in St. Louis is provided throughout this work as an example of an "Organized Anarchy" behavioral model where many semi-autonomous units exist, and actions are many times only loosely coupled to results.},

For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence -- a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict. To support future design of technology for neurodiverse teams, we propose: (1) a design space and design concepts including collaborative and affective computing tools, and (2) extending Social Translucence to account for student and group identities.},

abstract = {Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved its momentum in various areas such as image processing and natural language processing thanks to the advances in processing speed, data acquisition and storage. Many research efforts have been exerted to apply AI to computer networking. Performance evaluation of network systems using AI techniques can be conducted using ns-3, and such studies can be facilitated if ns-3 is able to interact with the existing open-source AI frameworks. In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework. This ns-3 extension module may foster the performance evaluation of AI algorithms in computer networking research with much reduced development workload.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology has emerged as an important technology for engineering cells to behave in controllable and predictable ways. The promise of this modern technology is dependent on our understanding of cellular complexity to allow us to engineer cells with novel function. In this regard, the fields of computer science and synthetic biology are critical for accelerating both our understanding of biological systems, and our ability to quantitatively engineer cells. Thus, advances in biology and biotechnology are arising at the intersection of computer science and synthetic biology approaches. This review seeks to introduce the field of synthetic biology to the computer science community, and to ignite a curiosity and interest in fostering a unique synergy for possible collaborations between synthetic biologists and computer scientists.},

abstract = {Manually finding the program unit (e.g., class, method, or statement) responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. A popular family of such techniques is spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), which takes program execution traces (spectra) of failed and passed test cases as input and applies a ranking formula to compute a suspiciousness score for each program unit. However, most existing SBFL techniques fail to consider two facts: 1) not all failed test cases contribute equally to a considered fault(s), and 2) program units collaboratively contribute to the failure/pass of each test case in different ways.In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Applying XAI to the failed test case, we retrieve information about which program statements within the test case that are considered the most important (i.e., have the biggest effect in making the test case failed). Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.We compare the performance of our approach against five popular SBFL techniques: DStar, Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and OP. We measure their performance using the Top-K and EXAM scores. In particular, we focus on the result of the Top-1, which importance has been highlighted in automated program repair domain, where the proposed methods often assume perfect fault localization (i.e., the fault must be found at the first rank of the suspiciousness list). Our results show that our approach, named XAI4FL, has a statistically significant and substantially better performance in terms of Top-1 than the SBFL approaches. We also compare our approach with a simpler approach to get feature importance in a tree-based model (i.e., using the Mean Decrease in Impurity method). Our results show that XAI4FL statistically significantly outperforms the MDI method in Top-K and EXAM score. Our results and findings highlight that the utilization of XAI for fault localization can improve the overall results of fault localization techniques.},

However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.},

abstract = {Various forms of artificial intelligence (AI), such as Apple's Siri and Google Now, have permeated our everyday lives. However, the advent of such "human-like" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an "other" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change. It calls for a collaborative research effort from the HCI community to study and accommodate users for a future where they interact with algorithms, not just interfaces.},

Within it, we will scrutinise the intersections of artificial intelligence(s) and cities - i.e. urban life, spaces, places, geographies, infrastructures, and practices - from a multidisciplinary, design-oriented perspective. There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two. Traditionally, this has been the realm of design; In this workshop, we ask what themes, questions and methods should be addressed by an emerging design-oriented urban AI research community?},

For a realistic assessment of the opportunities and risks of AI, basic understanding of what makes AI applications different from other computer programs is necessary. How and what AI concepts can be introduced in primary and secondary education depends on the age and the computer science background of the students. In the talk, a sample of topics and methods for introducing AI in school is presented - covering machine learning as well as automated reasoning, offering unplugged material for students without background in computer science as well as possibilities for more formal introduction of AI algorithms and AI programming. In the second part of the talk, learning analytics and intelligent tutor systems are introduced as applications of AI methods to support students and teachers. While learning analytics is mainly behavioristic with focus on applying machine learning to prediction of students' performance, intelligent tutor systems are based on cognitive and constructivist principles with focus on AI methods for individualized diagnosis of misconceptions and feedback generation.},

The actors of this emergent practice are coming from contemporary art, media and digital arts. These artists have developed an original practice of AI within their creative field. In this article, we propose a qualitative study to explore the nature of this practice. We interviewed five internationally renowned artists about how AI is integrated into their work. Through a thematic analysis of the interviews, we first find that their practice relies on crafting algorithms and data as materials. We uncover how they explicitly use this material unpredictability rather than avoid it. Secondly, we highlight the politics of their practice that consist of resisting the culture of AI research, as well as its inherent power dynamics. We also highlight how their relationship with the technology is imbued with ethics and how they rethink their role with respect to the technology. In this paper, we aim to provide the CSCW community with a way to expand the framework in which AI can be understood not only as a tool but also as cultural and political design material.},

Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.},

However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.},

This paper presents a tangible AI interface, T.A.I, that enhances physical engagement in digital communication between users and a conversational AI agent. We describe a compact, pneumatically shape-changing hardware design with a rich set of physical gestures that actuate on mobile devices during real-time conversations. Our user study suggests that the physical presence provided by T.A.I increased users' empathy for, and social connection with the virtual intelligent system, leading to an improved Human-AI communication experience.},

abstract = {Developing large-scale exams for a massive number of preparatory year students by a small designated committee of exam developers is a common practice in colleges and universities around the world. However, in adopting this approach, some higher institutions might be confronted with some obstacles such as the unavailability of skilful exam developers and proper resources. To address this issue, we proposed CrowdyQ, a virtual crowdsourcing platform, to investigate the impact of involving a large number of same-subject university instructors in the creation and evaluation of question items in a collaborative manner for the purpose of developing high quality exams. This paper describes the development of CrowdyQ platform and it discusses briefly its potential significance in developing high quality large-scale exam questions in a university context.},

abstract = {Context: Software Engineering (SE) is a key topic in undergraduate computing-related courses that provides the basic knowledge and skills necessary for professional practice in the software industry. Teaching SE principles, concepts and practices and relating them to real-world scenarios are challenging tasks, and the adoption of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects can help to face these challenges. On the other hand, using FLOSS projects as a didactic resource may introduce additional challenges to professors that are not familiar with the FLOSS ecosystem. Objective: This research aims to identify and map the profiles of professors of SE courses in Brazil, as well as to present the pedagogical practices used in the experience with FLOSS projects in Software Engineering Education (SEE). Method: We performed a survey with higher education professors in Brazil, used K-modes algorithm to identify clusters and Decision Tree algorithm to identify characteristics that determine the use of FLOSS projects in a sample of professors who had not used this approach in the classroom. Results: The results of the research revealed characteristics of professors who use, or not, FLOSS projects in SEE, of professors grouped in the two clusters generated by the application of the K-modes algorithm, of professors grouped by the application of the Decision Tree algorithm, in addition to presenting similar characteristics the pedagogical practices evidenced by each group of SE professors.},

abstract = {New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such 'normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.},

abstract = {In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous terms. These powerful techniques have escaped obscurity in academic communities with the recent onslaught of AI &amp; ML tools, frameworks, and libraries that make these techniques accessible to a wider audience of developers. As a result, applying AI &amp; ML to solve existing and emergent problems is an increasingly popular practice. However, little is known about this domain from the software engineering perspective. Many AI &amp; ML tools and applications are open source, hosted on platforms such as GitHub that provide rich tools for large-scale distributed software development. Despite widespread use and popularity, these repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique properties, development patterns, and trends.In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of AI &amp; ML Tool (700) and Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a characterization. While not the only platform hosting AI &amp; ML development, GitHub facilitates collecting a rich data set for each repository with high traceability between issues, commits, pull requests and users. To compare the AI &amp; ML community to the wider population of repositories, we also analyzed a set of 4,101 unrelated repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a repository. We've captured key insights of this community's 10 year history such as it's primary language (Python) and most popular repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI &amp; ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in future research.},

Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user--AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.},

Existing efforts have focused on the model fidelity, which however should not be the only concern. Due to the lack of adequate understanding and trust in the model, many accurate energy models have not been deployed in the real world. In this article, we introduce explainability and interpretability into the building energy model. We first use partial dependence plots to explain and quantify the importance of features at a fine-grained level and reveal different importance change patterns with different feature values. We also use a surrogate-based approach to interpret the internal mechanism and decision-making process of the model. We show that the local mechanism interpretation is feasible when the surrogate is both accurate and explainable. Explanation and interpretation are visualized, to provide system users with intuitive and informative insights with multi-disciplinary discussions. Our research promotes the operation and optimization of building energy systems and supports the widespread adoption of energy systems based on machine learning.},

abstract = {The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. "Kisan One" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.},

Further, the office offered orientation services, testing services, counseling and follow-up services, individual inventory services, career guidance services, research &amp; evaluation services and placement services. In this paper, a data mining approach was used to produce a trend analysis through time series and forecasted data using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) of the student referral details from one of the Higher Education Institutions in the Philippines. Student referral historical data from the second semester of school year 2016- 2017, first semester of school year 2017-2018, second semester of school year 2017-2018 and the first semester of school year 2018- 2019 was used in the study. Results showed that absenteeism, poor attendance and poor academic performance were the highest number of recorded students' referrals over the others in which poor attendance yields a decreasing pattern among the three. On the other hand, based on the forecasted data, only poor academic performance and poor attendance showed a slight increasing patterns among others. These further signify that a proper program should be in place by the school counselors in mitigating the occurrence of referrals especially on the reasons showing an increase of prediction data.},

abstract = {EXplainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret how a deep neural network predicts inputs through model saliency explanations that highlight the input parts deemed important to arrive at a decision for a specific target. However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region. We made our code available at https://github.com/yslin013/evalxai.},

abstract = {Universities need to increasingly adapt their educational methods in order to prepare the new generation of experts with additional skills for the future of work. Especially in the field of ICT, besides proficiency in theoretical and subject-related ICT knowledge and practical programming skills, young graduates have to demonstrate mastery in different transversal and soft skills. Taking into account that the ICT sector is one of the most knowledge-intensive, export-oriented and globally recognized sectors in Bulgaria, the quality of the ICT training is substantially important for its future competitiveness and growth. Stepping on a theoretical framework for 21st century skills, the present research aims to outline what are the key 21st century skills of the young graduates, as evaluated by ICT employers and University lecturers. By presenting the outcomes of ten in-depth, semi-structured interviews with company owners, business leaders, HR managers, and academics, the paper outlines the main trends and rankings of the soft skills for ICT graduates, without taking in consideration the specific professional competences or subject-related knowledge. The first part introduces the context, the methodology and the scope of the research. The outcomes of the interviews are presented both as quantitative figures and as specific comments of the participants, highlighting different practical aspects. Finally, the current analysis provides fruitful insights and recommendations about the new types of methods for training relevant for the ICT sector 21st century skills.},

abstract = {The spread of Covid-19 virus around the world has taken many lives, quarantined people and shattered many industries. Due to high transmissibility of the virus and its silent incubation period in human beings, detection of the virus plays an important role to control its spread and to plan diagnostic and preventive measures. Laboratory tests such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) take more time and hence there is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to detect the virus to prevent its spread and combat it. Today PCR tests were used for diagnosing purposes and the chest x-ray was only used as the follow up of patients, hence these studies on the chest x-rays of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia or any other disease are still limited to the literature and must be improved in the future. In this project, the goal is to build an application for healthcare workers to monitor the health of lungs using the chest x-ray images of patients. The algorithm must be very accurate because it deals with the lives of people. Here we used computer vision and deep learning techniques in this project. The focus is to classify chest x-ray images and segment the abnormal region and to get more insights on the images from the available datasets. The diagnostic accuracy is the challenging part and to increase the detection efficiency due to the limited open-source data available. The data was collected from the internet. On classification, the trained model was able to achieve 93.10% accuracy and F1 Score of 0.93 after using transfer learning technique with pneumonia images. On segmentation, the Intersection Over Union value was found to be 0.91 on the validation data.},

abstract = {Refugee camps are defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as “temporary facilities built to provide immediate protection and assistance to people who were forced to flee their homes due to war, persecution or violence”. The average lifespan of a refugee camp is seventeen years after which they organically transition into new towns. This paper uses Jordan as a case study, as it has been the country hosting the largest number of refugees since 1947. Daily practices by refugees subvert the initial planned camp into organic formations suitable for their changing needs, overriding the rigid built environment which no longer serves them. Addressing SDGs number 10: Reduced Inequalities, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 17: Partnerships of change, this ongoing research assesses the use of segmentation algorithms as a first step in identifying morphological patterns in the built environment and understanding transient scenarios of a refugee camp's spatial organization. By understanding patterns of spatial change, the inevitable transition from temporary to permanent settlement can be guided away from “slummification” and towards creating adequate low-income housing for refugees in Jordan.},

abstract = {In the business world the accounting cycle is characterized by numerous interconnected processes [1]. However, despite the invention of new technologies useful in each step of the process, their integration still appears limited and their potential is still little exploited. Here, the authors link all the available technologies to every step of the financial accounting cycle, envisaging the use of a cloud platform on which to build a solid integrated system. Although integration is far from easy (it is no coincidence that it has not happened yet) this model takes into account all the practical needs of the stakeholders involved in the process: accountants, chartered accountants, auditors, governments, public and fiscal authorities, shareholders, creditors, data analysts. This novel approach can seriously offer a breakthrough to accounting and finance big data management [2][3]. This represents an effective method to solve various challenges such as tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering, accounting errors, high data storage costs, high audit risks, difficult and unreliable reconciliations, data collection and data analysis, lack of comparability between financial statement of companies based in different countries [4][5].},

More specifically, an online platform program originally designed to foster student engagement in learning via inquiry-based (IBL) pedagogies and mobile device (MD), entitled Stanford Mobile Inquiry-based Learning Environment (SMILE), was implemented. 37 sophomores participated in a four-week long program, where they were asked to read a few news articles related to current issues of early childhood education and generate questions, then response to other users' questions, following a facilitator's direction. The student participant's questions were automatically scored out of a 5-point Likert scale by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within SMILE, whereas their responses were scored by other users. The results revealed that not only did the student participants' scores (i.e., the quality of the questions) increase, but their responses among themselves became more active. The current study proposed several practical suggestions for teacher educators who wish to effectively integrate technology within their higher education settings.},

Originally used in messaging systems and customer service, chatbots have currently also been used in various fields such as health, human resources, and education. In this work in progress, we investigated the use of chatbots in higher education, especially in academic and career counseling services.

Based on long-standing pedagogical research demonstrating the importance of using tools and visualizations to reinforce student learning, this case study reports on the impacts of using publicly-available visualization tools used in HCI practice as a resource for students examining algorithmic fairness concepts. Through qualitative review and observations of four focus groups, we examined six open-source fairness tools that enable students to visualize, quantify and explore algorithmic biases. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits, challenges, and opportunities of integrating fairness tools as part of machine learning education.},

With the advancement of science and technology, the new-generation information technology represented by "Cloud Computing, Big Data, Internet of Things, Mobile Network and Artificial Intelligence" has been profoundly changing the form of education, accelerating the transformation from Teaching 1.0 to Learning 2.0. To investigate the factors influencing university students using new generation of information technology in intelligent foreign language learning, this study proposed a research model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The sample data were collected from a survey of 237 students at a university. The analysis of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, construction of foreign language intelligence classroom, and computer self-efficacy all have a positive impact on learners’ behavioral intention. These findings suggest that more emphasis should be laid on students’ learning characteristics, advantages of new generation of technology, as well as teachers’ intelligent literacy, so as to further promote the deep integration of the new-generation information technology and intelligent foreign language learning, improving the learning effectiveness ultimately and effectively.},

abstract = {Cloud computing continues to be an important technology in higher education. This domain is a rapidly evolving space, and continues to gain momentum as a primary infrastructure topology for technological advances across emergent industries. The on-the-cloud paradigm provides numerous affordances and new methods of working in industry, and also for end users within recent fields of study, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. As we move into the Industry 4.0 era with technology pillars such as the internet of things and cybersecurity, the importance of skillsets for cloud-based services will be an essential attribute for the majority of technology-related professions. Many higher education institutions have focused on offering training opportunities and programs for cloud computing, however, a lack of high-quality, contextualized to industry, curricula materials continues to be a challenge for educators. The purpose of this paper is to report on analyses conducted to categorize cloud computing courses currently taught in the higher education sector and to determine the possibility of moving towards the goal of a model curriculum. Additionally, the paper aims to provide guidance to educators about cloud computing skill-sets sought in the job market, and to report on a community platform designed to host cloud learning resources.},

abstract = {Higher education has always been based on a traditional education system. All learners have to attend all training courses without taking into consideration human and logistical constraints. This situation leads to major problems of massification, which unfortunately subsequently lead to problems of demotivation or even abandonment of a large number of students.A solution to these problems resides in introduction of distance learning. The implementation of online courses, such as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), and the emergence of educational platforms such as LMS (Learning Management System) or LCMS (Learning Content Management System), have made it possible to introduce the notion of e-learning into Higher education. Nevertheless, if e-learning has left the Stone Age elsewhere, it is still an emerging field in some countries as Morocco where it is far from having reached maturity. Like any new system or proposal, e-learning has its own detractors who need to be more reassured on certain aspects.In this article, we deal with some major issues related to e-learning platforms, which offer pre-established pedagogical content without really taking into account the particularity or evolution of each learner during the training path. We will therefore talk about a customised or adaptive e-learning. By combining UBA (User Behavior Analytics) and AI (Artificial Intelligence), we will propose during this article an LBA (Learner Behavior Analytics) model based on an a system called SBAN (Score and Behavior ANalytics).},

So how to accurately evaluate the health and sustainability of the higher education system and make correct reform has become a necessary problem. In this paper, the health evaluation model and sustainability evaluation model of the higher education system are established. And evaluate them in six countries which are the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, India and South Africa. The results show the sustainability rating is Ⅴ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ, Ⅱ, Ⅰ. In order to summarize the factors affecting the higher education system as far as possible, this paper screens 12 secondary indicators, such as the education fund and the number of institutions of higher learning, and replaces 12 secondary indicators with 3 first-level indicators using the main component analysis model, respectively, the cultural background of national higher education, the scale and investment of national higher education and the development prospects of national higher education. Using these three first-level indicators as input layers, the health status of the six countries mentioned above is evaluated by using the BP neural network evaluation model, then the higher education health evaluation model is obtained.},

Throughout the years, education faced a number of challenges. Different methods of teaching and learning are suggested to increase the learning quality. In today's world, computers and portable devices are employed in every phase of daily life and many materials are available online anytime, anywhere. Technologies like Artificial Intelligence had a surprising evolution in many fields especially in educational teaching and learning processes. Higher education institutions have started to adopt the use of technology into their traditional teaching mechanisms for enhancing learning and teaching. In this paper, two datasets have been considered for the prediction and classification of student performance respectively using five machine learning algorithms. Eighteen experiments have been performed and preliminary results suggest that performances of students might be predictable and classification of these performances can be increased by applying pre-processing to the raw data before implementing machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {In Health Science Education (HSE), students must demonstrate technical skills in many procedures. However, traditional teaching methodologies limit the possibilities for personalized feedback from an instructor and generally do not allow students to achieve the required proficiency levels. Concerning this, technology has been installed as a learning resource with numerous benefits that allow new multidisciplinary lines of research, such as learning analytics (LA) and educational data mining (EDM). Both LA and EDM seek to improve educational practice based on the intensive use of educational data, such as analyzing online learning patterns, creating performance predictions, and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. There is a range of possibilities in applying LA and EDM in teaching procedural skills that have not yet been explored. For this reason, this study aims to answer (1) How the educational data explain the development of procedural skills in virtual environments to support the teaching-learning process in Health Science Education?; and (2) How automatic feedback and adaptive personalization affect the performance and instructional design of the procedural skills learning process of health science students? We expect that this study contributes to the field of technical skills learning mediated by technology in higher education by using the data provided by the interaction of students with virtual resources to support educational decision-making and optimize the teaching and learning processes in HSE.},

abstract = {The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is not new, with discussions going back at least 40 years. Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom’s taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how.

With the continuous advancement of university education reform, student information presents the characteristics of wide source, fast change and difficult maintenance. This paper mainly studies the application analysis of artificial intelligence technology in university student affairs management. In system building, not only business thinking should be separated, but also the process of business analysis should be transformed into the process of system building. By sorting out the data items of student information, the data model is established. By establishing and expanding the business association between data items, the standardization and knowledge-based management of student information can be realized. On this basis, relevant artificial intelligence technology is introduced to help student staff analyze data, arrange work, and find problems and so on.},

abstract = {As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.},

abstract = {Traditionally artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses are taught at the senior and graduate level in higher-education computer science curricula following the mastery learning strategy, cf. Figure 1. This makes sense, since most AI and ML models and the theory behind them require a substantial understanding of probability and statistics, as well as advanced calculus and matrix algebra. To understand Logistic Regression as a probabilistic classifier performing maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation, for example, students need to understand joint and conditional probability distributions. In order to derive the back propagation algorithm to train Neural Networks students need to understand partial derivatives and inner and outer tensor products. These are just two of many examples where substantial mathematical background - typically taught at the junior level in a computer science major program - is required. With AI and ML algorithms being used more widely by enterprises across domains, as well as, in applications and services we use in our daily lives, it makes sense to raise awareness about what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how it is used to solve problems to a broader audience. Very much in the same spirit as the "CS for all" idea (https://www.csforall.org), we have to extend our curricula to include introductory courses to AI and ML on the early undergraduate level (or even in high-school) to expose students to the ideas and working principles of AI technology. One way to achieve this is to introduce the principles of working with data, modeling, and learning through the data science workflow.},

abstract = {AI in My Life’ project will engage 500 Dublin teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds in a 15-week (20-hour) co-created, interactive workshop series encouraging them to reflect on their experiences in a world shaped by Artificial Intelligence (AI), personal data processing and digital transformation. Students will be empowered to evaluate the ethical and privacy implications of AI in their lives, to protect their digital privacy and to activate STEM careers and university awareness. It extends the ‘DCU TY’ programme for innovative educational opportunities for Transition Year students from underrepresented communities in higher education. Privacy and cybersecurity researchers and public engagement professionals from the SFI Centres ADAPT1 and Lero2 will join experts from the Future of Privacy Forum3 and the INTEGRITY H20204 project to deliver the programme to the DCU Access5 22-school network. DCU Access has a mission of creating equality of access to third-level education for students from groups currently underrepresented in higher education. Each partner brings proven training activities in AI, ethics and privacy. A novel blending of material into a youth-driven narrative will be the subject of initial co-creation workshops and supported by pilot material delivery by undergraduate DCU Student Ambassadors. Train-the-trainer workshops and a toolkit for teachers will enable delivery. The material will use a blended approach (in person and online) for delivery during COVID-19. It will also enable wider use of the material developed. An external study of programme effectiveness will report on participants’: enhanced understanding of AI and its impact, improved data literacy skills in terms of their understanding of data privacy and security, empowerment to protect privacy, growth in confidence in participating in public discourse about STEM, increased propensity to consider STEM subjects at all levels, and greater capacity of teachers to facilitate STEM interventions. This paper introduces the project, presents more details about co-creation workshops that is a particular step in the proposed methodology and reports some preliminary results.},

However, currently little is known about the attitudes of distance education students to the benefits and risks associated with AI. For example, is AI broadly welcomed by distance education students, thought to be irrelevant, or disliked? Here, we present the initial findings of a survey of students from the UK's largest distance university as a first step towards addressing the question "What do students at distance universities think about AI?" Responses from the 222 contributors suggest that these students do expect AI to be beneficial for their future learning, with more respondents selecting potential benefits than selecting risks. Nonetheless, it is important to extend this exploratory study to students in other universities worldwide, and to other stakeholders.},

Therefore, it is now more and more convenient for us to know the excellence and gap between universities in various countries and regions. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study the comparative in the context of large data, Chinese and Japanese universities have the advantages and disadvantages of it education. Therefore, after consulting the relevant parties about it essence and it education, as well as the teaching background and teaching attitude of Chinese and Japanese universities, this paper integrates the information found by using big data-related algorithms, then analyzes and processes the relevant data using hierarchical bat algorithms, and then produces the experimental results we need. Experimental results show that the use of big data and hierarchical bat algorithms can better study the characteristics of it education in Chinese and Japanese universities.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing is a rapidly evolving field that is triggering a wave of innovations in various domains such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cloud skills are becoming essential for any technology-related profession. Furthermore, the accelerated adoption of cloud technologies by industry is increasing the demand for cloud-trained professionals. Thus, higher education institutions are offering training opportunities and programs in cloud computing, however, the lack of well-rounded and high-quality curricular materials continues to be a challenge for educators. A 2018 Working Group (WG) created a report that --among other artifacts-- described fourteen Knowledge Areas (KAs), with numerous Learning Objectives (LOs) for each KA, to teach cloud concepts. Expanding on that work, this WG will focus on providing a collection of resources that would eventually constitute a model cloud curriculum. By relying on two particular surveys: one that looks at the existing curricular offerings, and another one that maps knowledge areas to job titles in cloud computing, we plan to provide a dynamic and configurable curricular exemplars repository for the cloud community-at-large, following the popularity of hands-on, project-based learning methodologies as our primary focus.},

The method consists of three steps the first step is to lock in the research objectives, namely: a series of problems in green food and its industry orientation; the second step is to distinguish three types of problems, namely: the first category is a large probability event, the predictable problem is directly solved by machine learning; the second category is a small probability event, which relies solely on machine automatic processing or batch processing can't solve problems, using a variety of human-computer interaction methods to deal with; the third category is cases and very special exceptions, usually only rely on the corresponding human experts to find the ways, and then, through the knowledge acquisition path to develop a dedicated artificial intelligence system. The third step is to incorporate them into the actual classroom teaching practice, or find the special daily life circle, it can be artificially set, even virtual, and tested in various application environments. The result is: through the teachers and students to continue to explore a series of issues related to green food and its industry forming the characteristics of big data and higher vocational and technical education technology. The significance is that is, a series of results of the research of the smart system can be directly used to study a series of problems focusing on green food and its industrial orientation.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the world witnesses a major revolution in the world of communications and information technology, where technology has been entered into all aspects of social, learning and military life in both phases: public and private. In this paper, the role of technology of the learning aspects and the electronic learning platforms have been taken as a clear model besides the duration of the impact of this technology on the development of the 4.0th industrial revolution. The paper is shown a short overview of the newest trends included in the Industry 4.0 initiative and their impact on education and propose a new trend in higher education environment, its Industrial University Revolution 4.0. The impact here means that it is the degree of compatibility between the components of the industrial revolution in terms of technology and the range of applied standards that harmonize with the principles of the electronic platforms. For instance, entering the artificial intelligence in e-learning, smart room, book, testing, and etc. The result of this study shows that the recent trends in e-learning and its own platforms show large harmony between the 4.0 industrial revolution and the outcomes of e-learning.},

abstract = {Currently, adult higher education software engineering pedagogy isolates the student in a controlled environment during delivery, with application of their learning temporally distant from their professional practice. Delivering software engineering teaching that is immediately relevant to professional practice remains an open challenge. In this paper, we discuss a new pedagogical model which addresses this problem by embedding the validation of the student's learning within their rich professional context. We discuss our experience of applying the model to the design and delivery of a new post-graduate software development module, a core component in our new software engineering Masters qualification at the Open University, UK, a market leader in adult higher education at a distance.},

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the issues and challenges facing information technology implementation in higher education, from which the study seeks to compare key factors influence implementation decisions between Chinese and UK higher education. The study adopts a mixed method approach by using survey and in-depth interviews to collect primary data. The study found that Chinese and UK Universities encounter barriers, some are similar but others are different when deploying e-learning technologies. The key barriers are faced by UK institutions are mainly technical literate, lack of time and financial resources, and legal issues; whilst traditional mind-set; government support, teaching methods and market demand are the key barriers faced by Chinese institutions. The similar barriers faced between UK and Chinese e-learning deployment include the organizational capability and technical constraint. Based on the findings, the study called the attention of government policy makers and associations to provide necessary support to both UK and Chinese higher education institutions on their deployment of e-learning technologies. The research identified that technical constraints and organizational capability are common issues, this means that investment on technical expertise in e-learning technologies and further funding to provide training and human resources, are required from both institutional and governmental level, to help support the successful deployment of e-learning technology in higher education.},

abstract = {With the global increase in demand for online tertiary education, teachers are facing unique challenges in scaling assessment activities and meaningful student engagement. One such aspect is contract cheating behaviours exhibited in the modern online environment --- posing a threat to the academic integrity of tertiary education. These obstacles amplify when applied to traditionally difficult domains like introductory programming education. Prior research on contract cheating identification proposes that while challenging, techniques such as developing strong teacher-student relationships, and real-time discussions may lead to instances of identifying contract cheating behaviours. The proposition, then, is to scale real-time, student-teacher discussions with large, online cohorts --- similar to those discussions which traditionally took place in the classroom. This poster paper presents Intelligent Discussion Comments (IDCs): A scalable, teacher-asynchronous system which engages students in real-time discussions to extract authentic student understanding. Artificial intelligence services such as voice identification and transcription enrich the discussion process, supporting the teaching team in their decision-making process.},

abstract = {Digitization is a catalyst for transforming a traditional university when human intelligence is mainly invoked in learning practices, towards an intelligence university that dematerialized learning by using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and which integrates intelligent learning platforms namely MOOCs. Admittedly, the traditional university boasts of human intelligence that has served many learning techniques for many years. However, the content and the organization of higher education should change with the evolution and needs of the society, these requirements have emerged a Smart University System (SUS) that conforms to the Smart City (SC) referential, in terms of infrastructure, interactions, reasoning, and visualization. In this paper, we investigate the role and contributions of Service-Oriented computing (SOC) to elaborate a Smart University in order to provide relevant and equitable Smart Services for all the stakeholder of a university, in term of accessibility, self-study, collaboration, and partnerships. Through the integration of service concept as a principal component in the Smart University System (SUS) that promotes the reuse and the composition of services.},

The face recognition function based on the convolutional neural network and k-Nearest Neighbor classification method allows the early childhood robot to recognize a specified face. The two-degree-of-freedom PTZ can be automatically adjusted based on the PID (proportion-integralderivative) control to track a face. Preschool robots actively interact with young children and send their video information to parents in real-time, effectively establishing a communication bridge between the family and the campus. Because the preschool robot can track the specified face ID and send the video information directly to the parents, this avoids the wrong tracking of non-children and protects privacy to a large extent.},

As the third generation of artificial neural network, spiking neural network is more suitable for the simulation of biological neural network than the traditional neural network, so it is also expected in the field of artificial intelligence. The lack of an efficient simulation platform is limiting the progress of research on impulsive neural networks.

Through literature research, it is found that with the deepening of subject research, more and more researchers have begun to explore the impact of mobile learning methods on disciplines, teacher teaching, teacher evaluation, etc., while exploring the educational APP for students' independent learning methods. The field research of influence is scarce. With the maturity of mobile learning technology, education APP occupies the main force of the mobile application market, and students' learning styles tend to diversify. As an auxiliary tool for education and teaching, APP helps students to acquire more extracurricular learning resources, and it also influences students' independent learning methods. Therefore, this paper uses the method of comparative analysis to analyze the influence of educational APP on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and clearly concludes that education APP has a certain impact on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and deeply analyzes its influence on junior high school students. The factors of self-learning are followed by suggestions for management from software developers, managers, teachers and parents. Finally, it is intended to provide a new way of thinking and perspective for exploring the field of students' independent learning},

abstract = {This research elucidates the impact of implementing robotics and artificially based intelligence systems on employment in the hospitality sector in Uzbekistan, as well as the issue of how to manage the joint existence of robotics and people and their collaboration to avoid socio-economic risks related along with continuing population growth in Uzbekistan. The expected impact is positive if continuous professional reorientation towards robotics in restaurant and cafe services are organized properly. A qualitative method of data collection was applied as the phenomenon is new for Uzbekistan. Two hypotheses were confirmed during the research, namely: There is a move towards increasing learning and education in technical and technology-based institutions to prepare for the next wave of the economy based on high-quality engineers and IT specialists, and there is no relationship between the introduction of robotics in caf\'{e} and restaurant sector of the economy, and unemployment rate. Findings reveals that almost no use of robotics and artificial intelligence is observed in cafes and restaurants in Uzbekistan, and unlikely this will take place in the foreseeable future. Findings further reveals that caf\'{e} and restaurant sector is facing number of challenges related to standards, education, and automation and shows a huge capacity for further development and improvement. The introduction of robotics and artificial intelligence requires preliminary reforms and experimentation in this sector.},

Our overview of this growing body of literature is organised through the lenses of the Records Continuum model. We find four broad themes in the literature on archives and artificial intelligence: theoretical and professional considerations, the automation of recordkeeping processes, organising and accessing archives, and novel forms of digital archives. We conclude by underlining emerging trends and directions for future work, which include the application of recordkeeping principles to the very data and processes that power modern artificial intelligence and a more structural—yet critically aware—integration of artificial intelligence into archival systems and practice.},

The world around us is moving at a rapid pace, and artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things and robotics are imposing new rules on the labor market. Many job requirements have changed -- employees must have digital competencies to handle workplace responsibilities. Educational institutions also seek to meet the demands of business by changing the curriculum and teaching methods, i.e. gradually progressing towards the concept of Education 4.0. On the other hand, the pressure exerted by the globalization process on universities inevitably leads to the internationalization of education. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to present the university ranking criteria about their internationalization. The criteria have been developed by the authoring team in the context of Education 4.0 and applied in accordance with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP).},

In terms of the legal challenges, the USAF's goals of infusing artificial intelligence into autonomous labelling of FMV is also being challenged by a formidable, looming legal threat of new laws that will force the USAF to include 'humans in the loop' of its artificial intelligence and machine learning systems [20], [7], [15]. Again, we analyze these legal threats and present solutions to allow inclusion of a human in the loop. It is important to note that our solution to these technical and legal challenges form a two-pronged solution that yields a Bench to Battlefield, Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) autonomous FMV labelling system that will, as time goes by, learn and grow in its ISR identification abilities.},

Those efforts require the support of new technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Image and Video Processing, Big Data, and Machine Learning to tackle various problems related to this viral pandemic. In these circumstances, public places such as hospitals, public transportation, and supermarkets need a more scientific and practical system/guidance to identify the probable COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we design an Internet of Things-Artificial Intelligence IoT-AI based intelligent system to monitor the suspect cases in public places. Based on implicit/Explicit data acquisition flow, the system provides information to public authorities. In a public place, the actions of suspicious people are collected by sensors such as thermal cameras, connected cameras, and Smartphone embedded sensors. Subsequently, this data is sent to the system for analysis. Thanks to artificial intelligence technology, the system can extract useful information to determine suspicious COVID-19 cases. In this article, we will describe the proposed global system. The design of this type of system is a trend for the future wider application to deal with COVID-19.},

abstract = {The scientific and expert community does not fully explore such a factor of sustainable regional development as actualization of environmental education. The goal of this research is to develop a list of prospective majors in the higher education system for solving current ecological challenges ensuring stable regional development. We have made a predictive assessment of the demand for prospective majors in environmental science, which is not limited to the study of the need for such personnel strictly in the labor market. A number of factors that influence people's preferences when choosing promising areas of environmental education was taken into account, such as: the industry development in the field of renewable energy; the worldwide search for a waste-free model of plastic recycling; the global scientific, technological and innovative character of regional economy development, etc. The results of this study are based on expert opinions from the environmentally-oriented scientific community and employers in the Tula region, who took part in the online survey through questionnaires. The opinion of rectors of leading universities, as well as their staff and students, on the functioning of the higher education system in the area of environmental science considering its actualization was of no less importance. The results obtained include a list of recommended majors in the field of environmental science, capable of utilizing their digital competencies and skills in solving current environmental problems; trending activities in the field of environmental development and protection, which will be in demand in the economy of the future for the sustainable development of Russian regions.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence integrates with our daily life in more ways each day with the invention of new tools and applications. For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future.Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics. In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual educational tool to teach data science to high school students. The first activity introduces the visual analytic pipeline. The next interactive activities present machine learning classification and regression topics. We select datasets and applications which are relatable to our main audience. This paper describes the design and implementation of the data science educational tool for high school students.},

abstract = {This article represents approaches of the artificial intelligence methods, used in public administration. An overview of various technologies of artificial intelligence applications in the field of public administration and related fields is given. All of these research directions are particularly relevant to the task of digital technologies (including artificial intelligence) growth to create an efficient and competitive digital economics in Russia. Among the modern intellectual technologies that allow solving the widest range of tasks, an important role plays technologies related to natural language text processing - nonstructured NL-texts are essential segment of data, used for analysis and decision-making tasks (in terms of data volume, of course, video data have a leading position, however, they are usually suitable for solving tactical but not strategic management tasks). The article provides an overview of the existing methods of natural language processing and their practical application to the tasks of public administration. An integrated approach to the natural language processing tools using for solving practical problems in the field of public administration is considered on the example of the ISIDA-T system for extracting information from natural language texts, developed at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center PSI RAS. The system under consideration is distinguished by a modular approach to the pre-processing of unstructured text and the possibility of manual adjustment for a specific extraction task. This technological solution gives the necessary flexibility and ease of use. The system consists of configurable text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, target information retrieval and output of the results in user-friendly form modules. One of the important components of the system is an integrated knowledge resource that allows quickly and efficiently adjust the system to the specifics of the relevant subject area. An approach to the application of the ISIDA-T system to the task of fact information extraction (as the most important for analyzing the situation and subsequent management decisions) is proposed using the example of information extraction about resignations and appointments from news feeds.},

When possible, we provide evidence-based recommendations from the literature on how to overcome these challenges. We then consider the relevance of scholarship from general higher education and other STEM disciplines to the context of computer science in particular, discussing similarities and areas of divergence that would affect dissemination efforts. In order to better guide change agents in propagating beneficial teaching practices, tools, and resources, we conclude by summarizing best practices for promoting the adoption of innovations in computer science higher education.},

Many teachers were caught unprepared, compounded by a lack of the necessary hardware tools and a lack of mastery in selecting and managing software that supports teaching properly. For the second wave in autumn 2020, educational institutions were better prepared in Hungary and universities had already experienced hybrid education to some extent. Now, after the third wave, a lot of experience has been gathered from both the teaching and student sides. Based on the students' experiences, we analyse how they would like to listen to lectures, practicals and labs at university. The results of the analysis show that students are open to online learning for lectures, but still prefer face-to-face classes for tutorials and labs. The students' views will help to inform the way in which higher education institutions should deliver courses at the end of the pandemic period, which will also help to rationalise the way universities operate in the future in Hungary.},

A healthy and sustainable higher education system can effectively improve the country's competitiveness. The establishment of a complete and unified model for evaluating the pros and cons of the national higher education system is the basis for improving the level of the higher education system. In this article, we will build the relevant model in four steps. The first step is to search for documents and data, and use data on factors such as knowledge protection in multiple countries, higher education enrollment rates, education system quality, student Internet access, government education expenditures, the number of citations per paper, and the value of degrees. Build a model based on it. And standardize all data. In the second step, since the factors may have a certain correlation, the principal component analysis method is used to convert the equi-related variables into another set of unrelated variables and establish a model. The third step is to analyze the health and sustainability levels of higher education systems in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries based on this model, and obtain rankings and comprehensive scores. The fourth step is to use the entropy method to calculate the specific weight of each factor. Select one of the countries to reform the most weighted factor. Import the reformed data into the model again, observe and analyze its changes.},

It also compares its findings to previous work conducted on evaluation appearing in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL). In addition, the paper highlights works harnessing performance evaluation as one of their chief scientific tools and the means by which they use it. It extends the argument for why evaluation is essential in formal Artificial Intelligence and Law reports such as those in the journal. As in the case of two earlier works on the topic, it pursues answers to the questions: how good is the system, algorithm or proposal?, how reliable is the approach or technique?, and, ultimately, does the method work? The paper investigates the role of performance evaluation in scientific research reports, underscoring the argument that a performance-based 'ethic' signifies a level of maturity and scientific rigor within a community. In addition, the work examines recent publications that address the same critical issue within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract = {Fairness in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has gained much attention in recent years, which has led to the creation of multiple fairness metrics and frameworks. However, it is still challenging for practitioners to decide which fairness metrics to incorporate in their work and how to effectively incorporate fairness into ML and AI models and systems. ML and AI can benefit from computer-human interaction (CHI) expertise from our backgrounds in empirically grounded research. ML and AI black-box models that are creating biased results are in need of CHI expertise to add the human aspect to the evaluation and creation of AI systems. This will result in what I call Equitable AI systems. In my talk, I will describe an equitable AI system I created to create holistic diversity in higher education admissions, scholarships, hiring, etc. I will also discuss research from a CHI perspective in addressing bias in ML and AI.},

abstract = {With the ubiquitous role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday applications such as smartphones and social media, children need digital literacy skills to navigate the digital world, critically view, and reflect on the social and ethical implications of the design and architecture of AI systems. To address this increasing need for AI literacy skills, particularly for younger students, this paper presents the rationale of the LearnML project which aims to develop a framework and game-based educational material for promoting AI literacy among primary and secondary education students. We also describe the design and initial assessment of the game “ArtBot”, developed as part of the LearnML project. We review existing literature, discuss the educational game design and development of “ArtBot” and describe the initial feedback of students and teachers. Our goal is to provide insights and suggest guidelines for the implementation of game-based learning environments for supporting AI literacy skills of students.},

abstract = {It has been several years since Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) made their way into higher education, and several forms have arisen from this novel method of information acquisition. Teachers have been incorporating MOOCs into traditional classroom settings with varying degrees of success in order to accommodate students' diverse learning preferences, introduce this new method of learning to students, and make learning accessible to those who may struggle to follow traditional instructions. This study investigates a blended learning paradigm in which a MOOC is integrated into a typical classroom setting. Specifically, the purpose of this study is to understand students’ perceptions towards the strengths and weaknesses of MOOCs-based blended learning courses they have taken. Data were collected from email interviews with twenty students from various majors in a higher education institution in Vietnam. The results show that the high quality of MOOCs lectures and mentors, the good content of video lectures, and the possibility to develop necessary skills for students are the positive aspects as perceived by the interviewers. However, the problems including (1) low English competence to understand the video lectures, (2) the inconvenience of the plagiarism checker tool, (3) the lack of interaction and communication, and (4) the rejection of MOOCs-based blended learning are seen. Some recommendations were offered accordingly.},

abstract = {Project MLeXAI, Machine Learning Experiences in Artificial Intelligence, is a multi-institutional project that has been funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The goal is to develop a framework for teaching core Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics with a unifying theme of machine learning. The objectives are to enhance student learning experiences in the AI course by implementing a unifying theme of machine learning to tie together the diverse and seemingly disconnected topics in the AI course, to increase student interest and motivation to learn AI, and to introduce students to an increasingly important research area. To that end, a suite of hands-on term-long projects and associated curricular modules have been developed. Each project involves the design and implementation of a learning system which enhances a particular commonly-deployed AI application. In addition, the projects provide students with an opportunity to address not only core AI topics but also many of the issues central to computer science, including algorithmic complexity and scalability problems.Phase I of the project involved the development and testing of a prototype at three institutions: a small liberal arts college, a medium comprehensive university, and a state university. Phase II builds on phase I work and involves further development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI through a unifying theme of machine learning. The goal of phase II was to increase the number of modules and expand the implementation and testing to include a larger and more diverse set of colleges and universities.In this paper we present results of phase II assessment of the collaborative development, dissemination, and separate testing of the projects at the institutions of twenty participating faculty members. The institutions are geographically dispersed and represent a broad range of institutions and student body.},

The work is part of a broader research project about epistemic tools for the design of artificial intelligence systems. We conducted a qualitative study based on speculative design sessions. Participants were asked to imagine that they were responsible for the development of an artificial intelligence model in two distinct scenarios: loan applications and university admissions. Regarding Model Cards, the focus of this paper, a thematic analysis of the data suggests that participating developers were selective about which of the ethical issues they reflected upon were actually recorded in their cards. However, participants were hesitant to grant full autonomy to the model they were developing, a contrast with previous studies. These findings may contribute to our current understanding of how developers can leverage epistemic and documentation tools to engage in a more ethically informed design process of artificial intelligence systems.},

In this article, we revise the concepts regarding edge intelligence, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, the motivation to use edge intelligence, and compare current approaches and analyze application scenarios. To provide a complete review of this technology, previous frameworks and platforms for edge computing have been discussed in this work to provide the general view of the basis for Edge AI. Similarly, the emerging techniques to deploy deep learning models at the network edge, as well as specialized platforms and frameworks to do so, are review in this article. These devices, techniques, and frameworks are analyzed based on relevant criteria at the network edge, such as latency, energy consumption, and accuracy of the models, to determine the current state of the art as well as current limitations of the proposed technologies. Because of this, it is possible to understand the current possibilities to efficiently deploy state-of-the-art deep learning models at the network edge based on technologies such as artificial intelligence accelerators, tensor processing units, and techniques that include federated learning and gossip training. Finally, the challenges of Edge AI are discussed in the work, as well as the future directions that can be extracted from the evolution of the edge computing and Internet of Things approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students’ risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students’ risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student’s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.},

abstract = {Current data governance techniques are very labor-intensive, as teams of data stewards typically rely on best practices to transform business policies into governance rules. As data plays an increasingly key role in today's data-driven enterprises, current approaches do not scale to the complexity and variety present in the data ecosystem of an enterprise as an increasing number of data requirements, use cases, applications, tools and systems come into play. We believe techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning have potential to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in data governance. In this paper, we propose a framework for 'contextual intelligence', where we argue for (1) collecting and integrating contextual metadata from variety of sources to establish a trusted unified repository of contextual data use across users and applications, and (2) applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques over this rich contextual metadata to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in governance practices. We propose an architecture that unifies governance across several systems, with a graph serving as a core repository of contextual metadata, accurately representing data usage across the enterprise and facilitating machine learning, We demonstrate how our approach can enable ML-based recommendations in support of governance best practices.},

abstract = {Data bias and algorithmic bias are the primary contributing factors for fairness-related risks in AI-based decision-making. The concept of fairness is comparatively new and is sometimes only discussed in detail in graduate-level courses such as Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence. In addition, at the undergraduate level, a standalone course on fairness is not feasible due to the level of difficulty and the many other essential courses that need to be broached in a university's computer science curriculum. Therefore, instead of a standalone course, we have created a concise, high-level concept module on bias and fairness in automated decisions, with (1) lecture material, (2) demonstrations, and (3) assignments (i.e., exercises) on real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing, achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student attributes and allow institutions to instrument their AI resources in ways that are attentive to equity and fairness.},

The primary benefit is that it provides students computational resources sufficient to run modern AI techniques interactively, and avoids students needing to separately configure software packages and dependencies, since they can run notebooks shared by the instructor. We briefly outline two of our notebooks, for teaching deep learning with Tensorflow, and reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gym.},

However, the promised value of AI systems in specific business contexts might not be understood, and further integrated into the development processes. We wanted to understand how software engineering processes and practices can be applied to develop AI systems in a fast-faced, business-driven manner. As the first step, we explored contextual factors of AI development and the connections between AI developments to business opportunities. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews in seven companies in Brazil, Norway and Southeast Asia. Our investigation revealed different types of AI systems and different AI development approaches. However, it is common that business opportunities involving with AI systems are not validated and there is lack of business-driven metrics that guide the development of AI systems. The findings have implications for future research on business-driven AI development and supporting tools and practices.},

While there are many discussions around the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in general, such as the AI4People Ethical Framework, the ethical ramifications that ASAs will have on human relationships as we share not only personal data but our inner most thoughts and feelings, is less explored. We conducted a study with 199 student participants exposed to Sam, an ASA which acts as a personal guide to support the student during their studies. During the interaction, Sam elicits private information, takes decisions for the user and speaks of its own study experiences. Our results indicate that (loss of) autonomy raised the strongest ethical concerns. These results confirm the importance of informed consent, transparency and accountability of ASAs and question the ethics of false memories and emotion sharing.},

abstract = {This research is dedicated to the problem of transforming ”linear” educational systems of higher education institutions into a new paradigm of person-centered, blended and individual education. This paper investigates role, application, and challenges of applying AI to predict the academic performance traditional of students: dropouts, GPA, publication activity and other indicators to decrease dropouts and make the learning process more personalized and adaptive. In the first part, we overview the process of data mining using internal university’s resources (LMS and other systems) and open source data from students’ social networks. Such an aggregation allows describing each student by socio-demographic and psychometric features. Further, we demonstrate how we can dynamically monitor students’ activities during the learning process to supplement the resulting features. In the second part of our research, we propose various static and dynamic targets for predictive models and demonstrate the results of predictions and comparisons of several predictive models. The research is based on the information on data processing of more than 20000 students in 2013-2019.},

abstract = {Digital transformation in the world poses new challenges for workers: employers now demand employees possessing excellent professional, management, and communication skills. But modern higher education is not ready for developing such soft skills due to several problems occurred: (1) a lack of a unified typology of soft skills; (2) differences in understanding of importance of developing soft skills between students, higher education professionals, and employers; (3) unavailability and the lack of focus of higher education institutions on the development of students' soft skills; (4) the lack of valid methodologies for developing soft skills. The author used a method of content analysis of scientific literature and found out that there is relevance and necessity of improving students' soft skills and for managing this process in digital environment pedagogical monitoring can be used as it provides opportunities for well-timed control and solving occurring problems.Consequently, the aim of the research was to design a model for monitoring students' soft skills development using online technologies. The designed model includes usage of different types of monitoring and various learning and controlling teaching technologies. The experiment was carried out within foreign language learning as it can provide useful means of soft skills development. The study involved 226 first-year students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and was aimed at developing 3 categories of soft skills: communication, management, professional skills. Based on the content analysis, soft skills were developed using interactive teaching technologies; learning activities were uploaded into the Moodle, as well as testing was online. After utilizing the model proposed we figured out the statistical difference between results obtained during initial, intermediate, and final stages of the experiment, which proved the model's efficiency. Therefore, the model can be useful for soft skills development within foreign language learning in the system of higher education.},

Nevertheless, the human- computer's multimodal interaction is actually a dynamic and evolutionary process, so there are still some difficult issues that need to be further explored such as how to comprehensively deal with the multimodal fusion data, adaptively consider the user's personalized habits, and precisely understand the expresser's intentions. NeuroManagement, an emerging interdisciplinary subject to study human's management based on neural mechanism, provides new theory and methodology for probing into the above issues. From the perspective of NeuroManagement, this keynote paper analyzes the user's neural mechanism of multimodal interactions, discusses the characteristics of neural activities in that process, and proposes a framework of intelligent computation method to understand and measure the user's intentions as well as his/her psychological states. In order to promote the interdisciplinary development of artificial intelligence and neuroscience, Neuroartificial Intelligence, a new subject field is proposed by this paper.},

abstract = {Abstract: In the process of education modernization, artificial intelligence has developed rapidly, and MOOCs has become the main way of online teaching. College students are the main users of MOOCs, and the ability of autonomous learning is particularly important in the context of MOOCs. However, many college students still have problems in autonomous emotion, autonomous intelligence and autonomous behavior. Based on the advantages of rich MOOC resources and convenient operation, this article proposes strategies for college students to improve their learning autonomy. It includes the following three aspects. The first is to stimulate internal motivation and increase the consciousness of autonomy; the second is to use cognitive strategies to strengthen autonomous intelligence; the third is to use metacognitive strategies to monitor autonomous behavior.},

abstract = {With the rapid pace of advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), this essay aims to accentuate the importance of corrigibility in AI in order to stimulate and catalyze more effort and focus in this research area. We will first introduce the idea of corrigibility with its properties and describe the expected behavior for a corrigible AI. Afterwards, based on the established meaning of corrigibility, we will showcase the importance of corrigibility by going over some modern and near-futuristic examples that are specifically selected to be relatable and foreseeable. Then, we will explore existing methods of establishing corrigibility in agents and their respective limitations, using the reinforcement learning (RL) framework as a proxy framework to artificial general intelligence (AGI). At last, we will identify the central themes of potential research frontiers that we believe would be crucial to boosting quality research output in corrigibility.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) educational resources such as training tools, interactive demos, and dedicated curriculum are increasingly popular among educators and learners. While prior work has examined pedagogies for promoting AI literacy, it has yet to examine how well technology resources support these pedagogies. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic analysis of existing online resources for AI education, investigating what learning and teaching affordances these resources have to support AI education. We used the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework to analyze a final corpus of 50 AI resources. We found that most resources support active learning, have digital or physical dependencies, do not include all the five big ideas defined by AI4K12 guidelines, and do not offer built-in support for assessment or feedback. Teaching guides are hard to find or require technical knowledge. Based on our findings, we propose that future AI curricula move from singular activities and demos to more holistic designs that include support, guidance, and flexibility for how AI technology, concepts, and pedagogy play out in the classroom.},

Based on the above basic theories, based on a comprehensive analysis of the current situation of the university classroom teaching model, by comparing the gap between the ideal and reality, it is concluded that the main problems of the existing university classroom teaching model are the lack of independent learning conditions of students, the lack of positive interaction between teachers and students, teaching methods cannot adapt to the needs of students and teachers teaching reform ideas are weak. To improve and solve the deficiencies of the flipped classroom teaching model, the three aspects of establishing the teaching conditions needed for the flipped classroom teaching model, providing the technical support needed for the flipped classroom teaching mode, and perfecting the guarantee system of the flipped classroom teaching mode are to improve and solve the deficiencies of the flipped classroom teaching model so that it can adapt to the teaching environment of higher education and thus better guide the reform practice of the higher education teaching mode.},

abstract = {The field of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is advancing rapidly, and it is finding adoption in diverse areas such as Health, Commerce, Logistics, Retail and Manufacturing to name a few. Adoption of BDA techniques in the field of Higher Education is new, and it is steadily increasing. In this work, BDA techniques have been applied to track the Key Academic Performance Indicators (KAPIs) related to students at the Arab Open University (AOU) and to support the corresponding decisions in this regard. Since the AOU is a Pan Arab multi-campus distributed institution operating in 8 countries and makes extensive use of a wide range of cloud based applications to manage the students' life cycle, hence it is an ideal candidate for adoption of BDA techniques to track students' KAPIs across the AOU multiple country campuses. In order to achieve this objective, we have used IBM Watson Analytics (WA) platform to track the students' KAPIs. As a pilot project, we have focused in this work on the Information Technology and Computing (ITC) academic programme across the AOU. The Exploration and Business Intelligence BDA capabilities of WA have enabled us to analyze and track the academic KAPIs of the ITC students across AOU country campuses while the Predictive Analytics (PA) has led to identifying the dominant factors behind some of our problems such as students drop out rates. One of the most promising outcomes is the decision support dashboards such as the one related to the Student Risk Factor (SRF). By identifying At Risk Students, such dashboard can act as an "Early Alert System" to enable the AOU management to take corrective action to provide needed support to such students.},

abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at extremely high speeds. Current HPC platforms can achieve calculations on the order of quadrillions of calculations per second, with quintillions on the horizon. The past three decades witnessed a vast increase in the use of HPC across different scientific, engineering, and business communities on problems such as sequencing the genome, predicting climate changes, designing modern aerodynamics, or establishing customer preferences. Although HPC has been well incorporated into science curricula such as bioinformatics, the same cannot be said for most computing programs. Computing educators are only now beginning to recognize the need for HPC Education (HPCEd). Building on earlier work, this working group explored how HPCEd can make inroads into computing education, focusing on the undergraduate level. This paper presents the background of HPC and HPCEd, identifies several of the needed core HPC competencies for students, identifies the support needed by educators for HPCEd, and explores the symbiosis between HPCEd and computing education in contemporary areas such as artificial intelligence and data science, as well as how HPCEd can be applied to benefit diverse non-computing domains such as atmospheric science, biological sciences and critical infrastructure protection. Finally, the report makes several recommendations to improve and facilitate HPC education in the future.},

Key struggles that Computer Science students face during their studies at university include academic writing and programming. As such, many students find these topics challenging whereby even reducing interest in the subject. With the significant growth of technology during recent years to bridge the gap of human computer interaction with the real world, Voice User Interfaces (VUI) can potentially be used as solution within student support systems. This paper investigates the application of a VUI system aimed at providing student support and derives insights on user experience. As part of this study, a VUI prototype was designed and implemented to help Computer Science students in their studies by providing academic guides notably on academic writing, referencing, and programming. Evaluation involved the application of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to assess three constructs notably, response behavior, response quality and compensability.},

abstract = {Heads of higher educational institutions seek to optimize costs and increase the effectiveness of the educational institution. In this regard, they need to know how resources are allocated and used by type of activity. Due to its simplicity, direct costing methods are used. Overhead is distributed in proportion to the number of students. Traditional methods of costing the cost of providing services do not allow taking into account all the features of the activities of educational institutions and the business processes that occur in them, which determines the relevance of the research topic. It is necessary to apply methods that allow you to compare management accounting data with the types of activities and determine at what stage the provision of educational services requires improvement. This method is Activity-based costing. The volumes of consumed resources are calculated depending on the types of activities. The purpose of the study is to justify the use of the Activity-based Costing (hereinafter - ABC) parameter when using the cost of training programs for students in higher education. The theoretical and methodological base of the research lies in the works of leading Russian and foreign scientists concerning the substantiation of methods for calculating the cost of products (works, services), accounting regulations. The research methodology is based on the systems approach used to study various calculation systems with general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, comparison, synthesis, grouping and classification. The use of a modern method of cost accounting and production costing ABC will allow higher education institution to form the cost of training students for each course more objectively, which will objectively form the price for paid services and generate more reliable performance indicators of individual departments and chairs. The results of the study can be used in state and commercial institutions of higher education in determining the cost of services for training students in various programs. The scientific novelty of the study consists in developing a model of the distribution of indirect costs by function using the ABC method to determine the cost of training programs for students in higher education institutions.},

In Hungary, especially in STEM undergraduate programs, the dropout rate is particularly high, much higher than the EU average. In this work, using advanced machine learning models such as deep neural networks and gradient boosted trees, we aim to predict the final academic performance of students at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The dropout prediction is based on the data that are available at the time of enrollment. In addition to the predictions, we also interpret our machine learning models with the help of state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values. The accuracy and AUC of the best-performing deep learning model are 72.4% and 0.771, respectively that slightly outperforms XGBoost, the cutting-edge benchmark model for tabular data.},

In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.},

Following the success of this technology in the financial market with virtual currencies, blockchain begins to be used by different domains such as government and education as it provides a reliable, scalable and unchanging distributed environment for conducting and storing transactions on a network. Higher education is a system with many challenges that could be solved by adopting this technology. Protecting data transactions that involve student degrees is one of the challenges considered by educational institutions. Thus, this paper presents a reference architecture proposal based on blockchain technology and a proof of concept to register and consult student certificates issued by higher education institutions. With this architecture, we intend to evaluate a new business model in this technology applied to the educational domain. As a proof of concept, we presented a prototype implementation using smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform and an evaluation made by experts in high education.},

Natural language processing (NLP) in combination with cognitive systems may provide many interesting possibilities regarding automatic advice and tutoring of students, e.g. by answering students' questions. Therefore, this paper investigates the possibilty of using a cognitive software, namely IBM Watson, as a tool for developing a virtual tutor to answer common questions of students during an introductory Java programming course at a German University of Applied Sciences. The prototype software is evaluated using a qualitative study among participants. While the results indicate the future potential of such systems in education, in its current form it could only replace a tutor in very limited and specific scenarios.},

abstract = {Governments are increasingly using artificial intelligence to improve workflows and services. Applications range from predicting climate change, crime, and earthquakes to flu outbreaks, low air quality, and tax fraud. Artificial agents are already having an impact on eldercare, education, and open government, enabling users to complete procedures through a conversational interface. Whether replacing humans or assisting them, they are the technological fix of our times. In two experiments and a follow-up study, we investigate factors that influence the acceptance of artificial agents in positions of power, using attachment theory and disappointment theory as explanatory models. We found that when the state of the world provokes anxiety, citizens perceive artificial agents as a reliable proxy to replace human leaders. Moreover, people accept artificial agents as decision-makers in politics and security more willingly when they deem their leaders or government to be untrustworthy, disappointing, or immoral. Finally, we discuss these results with respect to theories of technology acceptance and the delegation of duties and prerogatives.},

As in previous editions, the papers presented to the Evaluation in Education and Guidance track have reflected on the current challenges of educational assessment, revolving mainly around two topics: student assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and competence assessment in higher education.The authors explained the main findings and conclusions of their papers through publicly available video presentations, and the Chairs organized a Delphi-based debate activity in order to collectively reflect on the two aforementioned topics. To that end, the Chairs prepared an open-ended questionnaire consisting of nine questions so that the authors could express their opinions. Then, a live session ensued in which the Chairs explained the different points of view on each issue and the authors debated them.This paper presents an overview of the papers submitted to the track, as well as a summary of the main conclusions that emerged from the questionnaire and the live session.},

In recent years, the research about emotional interaction in online education, and the application of Affective Computing in online education came into being. This paper introduces the impact of Affective Computing on online education, including the use of expressions, speech, eye movement, and physiological signals, as well as text and questionnaires and other modals, or multi-modal to infer students' emotional state and learning state in the learning process, and then to realize personalized learning support. The emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface, can be applied to online education combined with Affective Computing technologies to improve the interaction between learners and the on-line learning system. This paper proposes a framework of online learning and experiment system based on Affective Computing supported by Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface. The system can provide personalized education for students and help them to carry out experiments in a virtual reality environment. The framework can reduce the impact on students in the process of data collection, so that it can obtain more real data, and the framework uses emerging technologies to provide support and reference for emotion analysis and recognition, which will make the analysis and response more timely and emotion recognition more accurate.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has immense potential spanning research and industry. AI applications abound and are expanding rapidly, yet the methods, performance, and understanding of AI are in their infancy. Researchers face vexing issues such as how to improve performance, transferability, reliability, comprehensibility, and how better to train AI models with only limited data. Future progress depends on advances in hardware accelerators, software frameworks, system and architectures, and creating cross-cutting expertise between scientific and AI domains. Open Compass is an exploratory research project to conduct academic pilot studies on an advanced engineering testbed for artificial intelligence, the Compass Lab, culminating in the development and publication of best practices for the benefit of the broad scientific community. Open Compass includes the development of an ontology to describe the complex range of existing and emerging AI hardware technologies and the identification of benchmark problems that represent different challenges in training deep learning models. These benchmarks are then used to execute experiments in alternative advanced hardware solution architectures. Here we present the methodology of Open Compass and some preliminary results on analyzing the effects of different GPU types, memory, and topologies for popular deep learning models applicable to image processing.},

Nonetheless, few studies have examined students' perceived fairness towards AI-enhanced systems in education. This study aimed to explore and understand factors that shape students' perceived fairness towards an AI system for math learning at the college level. Specifically, we have conducted a between-subjects randomized experiment with 395 participants to reveal factors that influenced participants' perceptions of fairness. The results showed that students' math anxiety levels and majors could influence participants' reported perceived fairness. In contrast, the outcome favorability of the predictive system did not affect students' perceptions of fairness. Future investigations have been planned to further understand the relationships between the designed manipulations and perceived fairness.},

The rapid development of artificial intelligence has made sufficient preparations for its involvement in school education and realization of smart classrooms. Based on the intelligent architecture of artificial intelligence, it will redefine classroom teaching with its closed-loop architecture formed by intelligent interaction and intelligent deep learning. To further strengthen the ideological education of college students is necessary to conform to the development situation of the big data era. Therefore, it is necessary to actively explore ideological education strategies for college students based on the era of big data by building network positions, applying social media, developing application software, relying on communication tools, and building smart classrooms. This article is based on the smart classroom information technology platform to design teaching goals and plans, implement interactive teaching, and innovate the teaching design and implementation strategies of smart classrooms.},

abstract = {A 2016 survey commissioned by the British Higher Education Council revealed CS graduates had one of the highest unemployment rates. Industry sources attribute this to a growing gap between employer expectations and university curriculum. This gap primarily consists of soft skills and higher-order thinking skills, which include the ability to analyse, synthesise, evaluate, critique and design. Technical job advertisements increasingly specify higher order thinking skills as entry requirements for graduates.This paper presents the results of our work studying whether formative tasks can develop higher-order thinking skills. The formative tasks consisted of quizzes covering the first four levels of the Bloom's taxonomy. The higher-order thinking skills were measured based on the static and dynamic models students created for a real world problem, as part of the final exam. Our results reveal a strong correlation exists between application and analysis level quizzes and design activities needing higher-order thinking in the exam. Students repeating the quizzes several times also had better results than others in higher-order design skills. These results suggest that practising with well-constructed quizzes especially at the higher Bloom's level exercises the cognitive channels that help improve higher-order thinking skills.},

Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students.},

The teaching method was based on the Flipped Classroom (FC) methodology and 10 Kahoot format questions were created. The methodology used in this study was document collection procedures, questionnaire and content analysis. The data showed that 19% of 35 students had more than five hits in Kahoot and most of them attribute the errors to lack of adequate study, difficulty in responding correctly in a short time, and lack of concentration or memory. There was no rejection about the tool, since 66% of the students would recommend its use in higher education. The positive aspects of the Kahoot most cited were its usefulness, the possibility of stimulating and motivating learning by promoting or dynamism, fun, participation and competitiveness in the classes. Promoting new strategies for teaching and learning, seeking to involve and motivate students with methodologies such as Flipped Classroom is highly recommended, as digital natives are no longer satisfied with traditional classes.},

abstract = {The current situation of educational Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory reform system, college students' innovation, and entrepreneurship practice are discussed under the background of the artificial intelligence era. The education cooperation of Universitas Potensi Utama (UPU) and the development of new Internet models have achieved complementary advantages and strengthened the interactive technology, exchange research, and cooperation of education in different regions. UPU strengthened experimental teaching reform, VR reformed the laboratory management system, further implemented the college student talent training plan, adapted to the needs of teaching reform and other means, and further effectively utilized the benefits of VR laboratory resources[1]. UPU implemented the talent training program for college students, adapted to the needs of teaching reform and other means to effectively improve the construction of an educational VR laboratory. The construction of an educational VR laboratory not only promoted the innovation and entrepreneurship of college students but also activated the cooperation between UPU and enterprises in the VR industry. As a result of the VR lab system reform, Indonesian universities will also cooperate with Shinta VR and other commercial VR industries in the future, which will be indispensable for promoting innovation and entrepreneurship among university students. The combination of the VR laboratory of UPU and the practical research of college students has played a huge role in promoting the development of the VR laboratory of UPU. The development of the VR laboratory is of positive significance to promote graduation, employment, and entrepreneurship of UPU design majors.},

However, there are no industry standards yet that measures the performance capabilities of massive scale AI deployments that must per-form very large number of complex inferences in parallel. In this work-in-progress paper we describe TPC-I, the industry's first benchmark to measure the performance characteristics of massive scale industry inference deployments.

abstract = {StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is “fog of war,” which refers to the fact that players cannot see their opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the game means that the information required in order to predicting the opponent's strategy is only available through “scouting.” Although the “fog of war” is one of the most important features of the game, it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the “fog of war” in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs. human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic analysis with “fog of war” reveals the predictability of the machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.},

This paper describes the process applied to develop open-book online exams for final year (undergraduate)students studying Applied Machine Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning courses as part of a four-year BSc in Computer Science. We also present processes used to validate the examinations as well as plagiarism detection methods implemented. Findings from this study highlight positive effects of using open-book online exams, with ~85% of students reporting that they either prefer online open-book examinations or have no preference between traditional and open-book exams. There were no statistically significant differences reported comparing the exam results of student cohorts who took the open-book online examination, compared to previous cohorts who sat traditional exams. These results are of value to the CSEd community for three reasons. First, it outlines a methodology for developing online open-book exams(including publishing the open-book online exam papers as samples). Second, it provides approaches for deterring plagiarism and implementing plagiarism detection for open-book exams. Finally, we present feedback from students which may be used to guidefuture online open-book exam development.},

abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at extremely high speeds. Current HPC platforms can achieve calculations on the order of quadrillions of calculations per second with quintillions on the horizon. The past three decades witnessed a vast increase in the use of HPC across different scientific, engineering and business communities, for example, sequencing the genome, predicting climate changes, designing modern aerodynamics, or establishing customer preferences. Although HPC has been well incorporated into science curricula such as bioinformatics, the same cannot be said for most computing programs. This working group will explore how HPC can make inroads into computer science education, from the undergraduate to postgraduate levels. The group will address research questions designed to investigate topics such as identifying and handling barriers that inhibit the adoption of HPC in educational environments, how to incorporate HPC into various curricula, and how HPC can be leveraged to enhance applied critical thinking and problem solving skills. Four deliverables include: (1) a catalog of core HPC educational concepts, (2) HPC curricula for contemporary computing needs, such as in artificial intelligence, cyberanalytics, data science and engineering, or internet of things, (3) possible infrastructures for implementing HPC coursework, and (4) HPC-related feedback to the CC2020 project.},

abstract = {The INSPIRE pilot project provides core evidence on key interventions and CPD needs to enable a 4IR (Fourth Industrial Revolution) curriculum within secondary education. Across the UK, there is currently no systematic pedagogical design or evaluation to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning to include 4IR skills and knowledge. There is also no clear national strategy for schools and FE colleges to follow in how to embed 4IR, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Internet of Things tools, skills and understanding into their teaching. Such a lack of an evidence-based research study impacts our young students in particular and education system in general, and further discriminates against disadvantaged and digitally excluded groups. We applied a design-based research methodology framework and worked with two London based schools to co-design and deliver a series of workshops to 13-14-year-old students introducing them to 4IR skills through engaging practical activities. Within the pilot study we engaged with both co-designers and students to capture opinion, understanding, learning and enjoyment before, during and after the workshops. The significance of this paper is twofold; to identify lessons learnt in developing 4IR skills and knowledge within the curriculum and to share the insights of the adults and young learners throughout the project.},

abstract = {This research work aims to automate the prediction of peripheral arterial diseases implied by the Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler (LEAD) studies by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This study is the first to use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze LEAD data for peripheral arterial disease prediction. Specifically, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the waveform into three types. The classified waveforms are used as input to the learning algorithms for disease prediction. We evaluate two traditional machine learning algorithms as well as two neural networks to predict normal and three types of artery diseases: aortoiliac disease, femoral-popliteal arterial disease, and trifurcation disease. The hierarchical neural network model (HNN) is investigated to deal with imbalanced data set. The first level of the HNN predicts the normal from diseases. The remaining two neural networks are used to predict other diseases from the rest. HNN has achieved high F1 scores: 99% on the normal case, 97% on the aortoiliac disease, and 94% on the femoral-popliteal arterial disease and 89% on the trifurcation disease through 10-fold cross-validation. The comparison shows that HNN works better than multilayer perceptron, random forests, and SVM. The overall result demonstrates that machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can be developed for peripheral arterial diseases implied by the LEAD studies while reducing the reading variability in vascular laboratories.},

abstract = {The ecosystem for automated offensive security tools has grown in recent years. As more tools automate offensive security techniques via Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), it may result in vulnerabilities due to adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is imperative that research is conducted to help understand the techniques used by these security tools. Our work explores the current state of the art in offensive security tools. First, we employ an abstract model that can be used to understand what phases of an Offensive Cyber Operation (OCO) can be automated. We then adopt a generalizable taxonomy, and apply it to automation tools (such as normal automation and the use of artificial intelligence in automation). We then curated a dataset of tools and research papers and quantitatively analyzed it. Our work resulted in a public dataset that includes analysis of (n=57) papers and OCO tools that are mapped to the the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework enterprise techniques, applicable phases of our OCO model, and the details of the automation technique. The results show a need for a granular expansion on the ATT&amp;CK Exploit Public-Facing application technique. A critical finding is that most OCO tools employed Simple Rule Based automation, hinting at a lucrative research opportunity for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in future OCO tooling.},

abstract = {Automated decision-making that impacts human interests, rights, and lives, in particular different data mining and artificial intelligence-based techniques, have become an integral part of many high-stakes applications such as sentencing and bail decisions, credit approvals, hiring, and predictive policing. However, fairness concerns, such as discrimination based on race, age, sex, etc., primarily stemming from data and algorithmic bias, is one of the major and contemporary problems associated with automated decision-making. In a traditional Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning course, educators usually teach different automated decision-making techniques but largely with limited coverage on their ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and privacy. In this paper, we share our experience in building and incorporating a fairness module 1 in an existing undergraduate Data Mining course, within traditional content, and evaluate the outcome of the initiative. The module includes lectures and hands-on exercises, using state-of-the-art and open-source bias detection and mitigation software, on real-world datasets. The goal is to help instill the consciousness of fairness and bias at the very early stage of a potential future developer of automated decision-making software. The module is easily adaptable, and can be integrated into other relevant courses including introductory Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning courses.},

abstract = {Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source.In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.},

abstract = {Big data is recognized as one of the three technology trends at the leading edge a CEO cannot afford to overlook in 2012. Big data is characterized by volume, velocity, variety and veracity ("data in doubt"). As big data applications, many of the emerging event processing applications must process events that arrive from sources such as sensors and social media, which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. Consider, for example, the possibility of incomplete data streams and streams including inaccurate data. In this tutorial we classify the different types of uncertainty found in event processing applications and discuss the implications on event representation and reasoning. An area of research in which uncertainty has been studied is Artificial Intelligence. We discuss, therefore, the main Artificial Intelligence-based event processing systems that support probabilistic reasoning. The presented approaches are illustrated using an example concerning crime detection.},

In particular for Higher Education we describe how the Virtual World constructed using the platform Avaya Live Engage, is used as an immersive environment with pre-service teachers, who are undergoing a 1-year teacher training program, and how the data analytics collected in-world is being used to monitor and direct content development. We focus our studies on the initial hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging and offer an experience that goes beyond the 'traditional' online education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be able to get empirical evidence showing the students' engagement with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey. In this paper we describe the research methods we use for the study, and give an overview of the information we can collect from the in-world analytics. We also propose how these analytics can be used for a predictive model with the intention of refocusing the virtual world experience to match learner needs.},

abstract = {With the alarming global health crisis and pandemic, the entire medical industry and every human in this world are desperately looking for new technologies and solutions to monitor and contain the spread of this COVID-19 virus through early detection of its presence among infected patients. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 is hence critical for prevention and limiting this pandemic before it engulfs the humanity. With early diagnosis, the patient may be suggested for self-isolation (or) quarantine under medical supervision. Early detection of COVID-19 can save the patient and minimize the risk of falling prey to CoviD-19. Machine learning, a subset field of Artificial Intelligence can provide a viable solution for early diagnosis of disease and facilitate continuous monitoring of infected patients. AI based approaches can provide a view of the degree of disease severity. In general, Artificial intelligence (AI) could be a better technique for quantitative evaluation of the disease to obtain fruitful results. This paper throws light on the emerging need for AI powered solutions to foster early diagnosis of COVID-19 and suggest an ML based health monitoring framework for diagnosis of infected patients.},

Based on the differences of learners and the implementation of personalized teaching, the functional architecture design of the "man-machine collaboration precision tutoring system" is proposed. The system architecture is divided into three layers: data resource layer, decision processing layer and interactive promotion layer. The data resource layer provides data recording and resource support, the decision processing layer plays the role of data diagnosis and learning analysis, and the interaction promotion layer realizes flexible interaction and grouping. Through collaboration and hierarchical interaction with teachers, a more idealized system can be constructed, which can integrate evidence analysis, timely feedback and personalized support. The value orientation of the system architecture is: teachers and students and intelligent systems expand time and space in collaborative activities, teachers and intelligent systems improve teaching in collaborative optimization, and students and intelligent systems enhance themselves in collaborative interaction.},

In this work, we apply three state-of-the-art XAI tools in a real-world case study. Our study focuses on predicting combined sewer overflow events for a municipal wastewater treatment organization. Through a data driven inquiry, we collect both qualitative information via stakeholder interviews and quantitative measures. These help us assess the predictive accuracy of the XAI tools, as well as the simplicity, soundness, and insightfulness of the produced explanations. Our results not only show the varying degrees that the XAI tools meet the requirements, but also highlight that domain experts can draw new insights from complex explanations that may differ from their previous expectations.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses are a promising area of interest of higher education institutions in their competition for students. However, typically specialised open platforms are used to create such courses, while courses in higher education institutions are delivered through learning management systems. Thus, a higher education institution meets a severe challenge if it decides to offer its study courses as massive open online courses: the content hosted in the learning management system need to be transferred to another platform or re-created. The automated tools developed for this purpose could (at least partially) speed up the learning content migration process while also reducing the amount of manual work required. The paper presents the research results achieved regarding the migration of the content of Moodle courses into Open edX through the use of the cloud-based automated migration tool. The conceptual migration model is described first. After that, some technical details of the developed tool are discussed. Finally, the experimental testing results of applying the tool to three Moodle courses are also specified.},

Meanwhile, artificial intelligence has emerged as a technology with the potential to profoundly reshape society. This has generated increasing demand for fostering an AI-literate populace. However, there is little work exploring how to introduce K-12 students to AI and how to support K-12 teachers in integrating AI into their classrooms. In this work, we explore introducing AI learning experiences into upper elementary classrooms (student ages 8 to 11). With a focus on integrating AI and life science, we present initial work on a collaborative game-based learning environment that features rich problem-based learning scenarios.

abstract = {Students' success has recently become a primary strategic objective for most intuitions of higher education. With budget cuts and ramping operational costs, universities are paying more attention to sustaining students' enrollment in their programs without compromising rigor and quality of education. Many of those universities have dedicated special units in their organizational structures to look after that objective. Traditionally, academic institutions have relied on data collected from registrar's transcripts, academic units' feedback, faculty's alert, and from interaction with students.With the proliferation of big data analytics and Machine Learning, universities are increasingly relying on students' data to predict students' performance. Many initiatives and research projects addressed the use of students' behavioral and academic data in their first academic year to classify students and predict their future performance using advanced statistical models. However, little work has been done to predict academic performance through machine learning. In this paper, we propose the use of automatic search in Machine Learning to identify the best model to predict student performance using data available prior to the start of the academic program.},

abstract = {The development of the new generation of information technology has rapidly integrated artificial intelligence and manufacturing, such as the Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing and digital twin. Countries around the world have responded by introducing their own advanced manufacturing development strategies. The United States' "Industrial Internet", Germany's "Industry 4.0" and China's "Made in China 2025" have all proposed to combine and use the new generation of information technology and artificial intelligence to achieve intelligent manufacturing. In addition, with the formation and development of global value chain, service becomes the key content to realize intelligent manufacturing, and a trend that cannot be ignored is the service-oriented manufacturing. This paper calculates the level of servitization of Chinese manufacturing industry, analyzes the regional differences of servitization in eastern, central and western regions, and puts forward the countermeasures and suggestions for the development of Chinese manufacturing service driven by the development of new generation information technology.},

abstract = {Biometric technologies are being considered lately for student identity management in Higher Education Institutions, as they provide several advantages over the traditional knowledge-based and token-based authentication methods, i.e., biometrics provide high security entropies, convenience and a sense of technological modernity to the end-users. While biometric technologies have many benefits from both a security and usability point of view, still there is a need for innovative user identity management solutions that continuously identify and authenticate students during academic and teaching activities. In addition, biometrics entail several threats and weaknesses with regards to the privacy of data stored about the user, which negatively affect the user acceptance and the wider adoption of biometrics due to regulatory and legal issues. In this paper, we refer to our ongoing research on intelligent and continuous online student identity management for improving security and trust in European Higher Education Institutions. We further highlight based on the literature, existing challenges, threats and state-of-the-art approaches with regards to preserving the privacy of biometric-driven data.},

When these systems begin to interact with humans, these concerns become much more complex and much more important. The field of human-AI teaming provides a relevant example of how AI ethics can have significant and continued effects on humans. This paper reviews research in ethical artificial intelligence, as well as ethical teamwork through the lens of the rapidly advancing field of human-AI teaming, resulting in a model demonstrating the requirements and outcomes of building ethical human-AI teams. The model is created to guide the prioritization of ethics in human-AI teaming by outlining the ethical teaming process, outcomes of ethical teams, and external requirements necessary to ensure ethical human-AI teams. A final discussion is presented on how the developed model will influence the implementation of AI teammates, as well as the development of policy and regulation surrounding the domain in the coming years.},

Many life-impacting decisions are being partially automated, including health-care resource planning decisions, insurance and credit risk predictions, recidivism predictions, etc. Much of work appearing on this topic within the Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence community is focused on technological aspects. Nevertheless, fairness is much wider than this as it lies at the intersection of philosophy, ethics, legislation, and practical perspectives. Therefore, to fill this gap and bring together scholars of these disciplines working on fairness, the first workshop on Bias and Fairness in AI was held online on September 18, 2020 at the ECML-PKDD 2020 conference. This special section includes six articles presenting different perspectives on bias and fairness from different angles.},

abstract = {Even as public pressure mounts for technology companies to consider societal impacts of products, industries and governments in the AI race are demanding technical talent. To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions. Our analysis will help AI educators identify what topics should be taught and create scaffolding for developing future AI ethics education.},

abstract = {Improving the physical condition of students has become an urgent problem to be solved by national higher education. This research mainly discusses the application of blockchain technology in the monitoring of student physical data. Through simple exercise tests, block chain technology is used to obtain objective data such as user's cardiorespiratory endurance and muscle strength. These parameters will serve as the basis for personalized exercise guidance programs. This step replaces the common exhaustive test in traditional systems, and reliable results can still be obtained while ensuring a certain test accuracy. The generated fitness guidance plan is automatically downloaded on the intelligent fitness equipment and guides users to execute it, ensuring that the exercise plan is executed on time and accurately, and the experiential fitness guidance is completed. In the management cycle, the exercise intervention plan is adjusted periodically, and the effect of the intervention is maximized by continuously optimizing individual parameters. Among the physical monitoring students, 41.3% of female college students and 23.7% of male college students participated in physical exercise occasionally. This research has positive significance for improving the physical fitness of students.},

abstract = {As the cases exploded, leading legal judgment prediction becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques in the legal field. The goal of legal judgment prediction is to predict the judgment results based on the facts information of a case. However, the classifier of the traditional method has poor accuracy performance and cost large computational time. The commonly used deep learning models are CNN and RNN. In this paper, CNN-BiGRU was established and analyzed, which combined the good extraction ability of CNN for local feature information and RNN for long-term dependencies information of the text. Compared with the CAIL 2018 dataset, the prediction accuracy of the charges, law articles and the terms of penalty are 94.8%, 93.6%, and 73.4%, respectively. Results showed that CNN-BiGRU has a higher prediction accuracy than CNN or RNN alone and a good training efficiency over baselines. The effectiveness and practicability of this model are validated.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.},

At present, the research attentions of labor education are labor education curriculum, labor values, labor skills, whole-person education, five educations simultaneously, model worker spirits. However, labor education should turn to the multi-dimensionality of student development, is gradually integrated with the subject curriculum, and synergistically promotes the spread and penetration of labor ideas through interdisciplinary labor, collaborative labor, learning by doing, and innovative labor. Research on labor education should deeply shift to improve students’ creative work: the development of integration of labor education and creative literacy, the transformation of labor objectives from the pursuit of simple labor knowledge and skills to innovation, the content of labor from school to school-enterprise alliance based on Internet + . In order to achieve the above, Internet + technology and the eco-service mechanism are very important. Therefore, this study introduces Internet + technology to build the eco-service mechanism of labor education. Internet + technology broadens the possibility of resource source of labor education, combination, and creation, eliminates labor fragmentation. Internet + technology also promotes the ecological flow and comprehensive service of labor education resources to enhance the overall quality of labor education. In the service mechanism of labor education, the enterprise's labor tutors and campus labor teachers are introduced into the labor space and the superior resources of labor space to promote students to labor innovation and improve creative wisdom skills in the cooperation and exchange of diverse talents, and committees to cultivating comprehensive talents with innovative labor thinking and innovative capabilities.},

This has led to an increasingly complex analysis process of the growing volume of data and to the incapability to take decisions regarding curricula reform and restructuring. On the other side, educational data mining is a growing field aiming at discovering knowledge from student's data in order to thoroughly understand the learning process and take appropriate actions to improve the student's performance and the quality of the courses delivery. This paper presents a thorough analysis process performed on student's data through machine learning techniques. Experiments performed on a very large real-world dataset of students performance on all courses of a university, reveal interesting and important students profiles with clustering and surprising relationships among the courses performance with association rule mining.},

abstract = {Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners’ AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers’ attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers’ input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers’ trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech’s Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech’s Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers’ responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers’ survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers’ trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education.},

abstract = {Objective: With the development of the Internet, Internet technology has had a great impact on English learning. This article explores the general expression of the performance, motivation and anxiety of students in Chinese medicine undergraduates in second language learning (SLL). performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates in China, it is to analyze the attribution and relationship of above three aspects, and propose the method of using artificial intelligence to improve students’ learning motivation, reduce learning anxiety and improve learning ability. Methods: it is to select the undergraduate students (n = 300) in Jilin Province of China as the subjects. Use the Chinese version of the Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale under Internet technology, the Chinese Undergraduate English Learning Motivation Questionnaire, the self-made College Students’ English learning ability evaluation scale and the English Writing Scale were used for test. Results: SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates are in the middle level among all undergraduates in China, and their English writing ability is lower than the middle level; Analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences in gender (p&lt;0.01) and grade (p&lt;0.05); learning ability in grade has extremely significant difference (p&lt;0.01); female 's learning ability and writing ability were significantly higher than male's (p&lt;0.01);Demographic variables were not statistically correlated with SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety (p&gt;0.05); SLL anxiety had remarkable correlation with learning motivation (p&gt;0.05); learning anxiety was statistically correlated with learning ability (p&lt;0.01); learning motivation was negative correlative with learning ability (P&lt;0.01). Regression analysis showed that learning anxiety and motivation had 44.3% and 5.8% explanatory power to English learning ability respectively. Intervention experiment results showed that Internet learning system significantly improved the performance of the experimental group (P&lt;0.01), and the performance of the experimental group in listening, reading, writing and translation was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&lt;0.01). the effectiveness of Internet learning mode had remarkable negative relationship with students’ learning anxiety (P&lt;0.01), and was significantly positive with learning motivation and learning ability (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the data-driven theory, the empirical study of Internet learning system in English teaching is completed, which provides an important theoretical support for the current College English intelligent teaching in China, which also provides a strong argument for the “scaffolding function” of AI in language learning. At the same time, the research also puts forward innovative ways to improve the effect of College English teaching from the perspective of psychology: through second language learning with AI resources, the “challenging task” set by the intelligent learning system increases the intensity and difficulty of learning, thus arousing the “promoting anxiety” of second language learners, and further internalizing the external and instrumental motivation in depth in order to improve English learning ability.},

abstract = {This paper aims at exploring the hot topics of big data research in China in the past three years. We choose Big Data, one influential and representative Chinese academic journal as our data source, and download the bibliographic data of 195 articles published in the past three years on this journal from CNKI. In order to gain the general overview of Chinese big data research status quo, we count the high frequency words and distribution of publish years. From the high frequency words list, we can tell that the times of mentions of "data" is far more than that of other frequency words, which verifies the fact that data is the most important concept in big data research. In order to extract the hot topics of big data research, we adopt LDA model to generate topics of the 195 research articles. With several experiments, we set the topic number as seven for the best outcome quality. With expert suggestion, we label the seven topics as "Big data helps government decisions", "Internet and management"," Artificial intelligence helps public security"," Big data promotes information", "Big data governance", "Artificial intelligence and 5G"," Big data prediction" based on the high frequency words in each topic. Most of the topic labels are linked to 5G, artificial intelligence and other modern techniques, which implies that the big data plays a necessary role in empowering the future techniques. We hope this paper could contribute to further big data research in China.},

Project-based learning effectively bridges the theoretical and practical education gaps by encouraging true knowledge, initiative, and a greater comprehension of the subject. This study was conducted to explore students’ perceptions towards the implementation of project-based learning in technical courses in a college in Vietnam where this method has been employed for several years. Data were collected from 98 students majoring in website design and software engineering courses. The questionnaire was developed in Google Form, and the link was sent to the participants via their email addresses. The results show that most of the students have positive perceptions of project-based learning approach. Students indicated that they gained confidence, enhanced their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities in computing disciplines, and enhanced their ability to communicate, engage, and work with team members, contributing to the overall quality of education.},

abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) is an analysis toolset that enables collection of students' data and context data, for the purpose of visualizing indicators of performance that allow for improvements for learning and academic success. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest were used. These algorithms trained a model that could predict the academic success of college-level engineering students. Under an experimental model with 182 students, three instructors leading six groups of Physics II for engineering majors of the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) administered adaptive measures for one group each and not for the other of their groups (the control groups). Three forecasts were calculated considering structured academic information (numerical grades) and unstructured academic information (student ID pictures). Unstructured data from the facial photograph and numeric academic information from the first evaluation period were considered for the study. The results show a significant difference between the control and experimental groups of only one instructor, while the results of the other two instructors' control and experimental groups were consistent. One finding of this study is that, despite the prediction not being correct for each student, a general picture of the performance of the group was given. It seems that the algorithm must be trained with more data for the forecast to be more precise in the future.},

abstract = {The concept of sustainability has become an important phenomenon globally with many organisations being affected by the heightened awareness in sustainability. Organisations are more aware of the importance of promoting sustainability in all areas of operations. This is no different in the higher education sector, with a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) playing a leading role in promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability.This paper highlights the importance of effectively managing sustainability information and the challenges HEIs face in sustainability reporting. Business Intelligence (BI) is a solution to overcome the challenges and effectively managing sustainability information. However, HEIs need to overcome a number of challenges associated with BI to ensure a BI solution is correctly implemented and is effective in solving the problem of effective sustainability information management. This study focusses on the management of sustainability information in South African HEIs. The results indicate that there are many challenges to managing sustainability information in South African HEIs, including siloed data and information as well as poor sharing and communication of information. These two challenges can be overcome by a correctly implemented BI solution.},

We analyzed the questions generated by students using inductive qualitative data analysis. We found that students pose exploratory questions and unfold knowledge using seven strategies, viz., Apply, Organize, Probe, Compare, Connect, Vary, and Implement. These strategies were validated within the data structures domain and were also found to be valid in another CS application domain (Artificial Intelligence). The content analysis of the questions has shown that students tend to unfold more conceptual knowledge than procedural knowledge.},

Cloud technology, services and applications are evolving rapidly and it is challenging to design an academic syllabus that encompasses a comprehensive and up-to-date body of knowledge in an engaging way.This paper describes our approach to designing a new module to provide a broad overview of Cloud Computing and practical skills in developing solutions using services offered by a cloud platform, in this case Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Computing undergraduate students at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU), UK. We describe the rationale for the syllabus design and outline the lectures, practical activities and assessments that were developed. The practicals were designed to be executed on the AWS platform as bite-sized tasks providing hands-on learning to reinforce prior lecture content. The first syllabus delivery at GCU shows that the students performed well, found the content engaging and easy to assimilate, and had a fulfilling learning experience.

abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks are ubiquitous and pervasive in many artificial intelligence applications such as speech recognition, predictive healthcare, creative art, and so on. Although they provide accurate superior solutions, they pose a massive challenge “training havoc.” Current expansion of IoT demands intelligent models to be deployed at the edge. This is precisely to handle increasing model sizes and complex network architectures. Design efforts to meet these for greater performance have had inverse effects on portability on edge devices with real-time constraints of memory, latency, and energy. This article provides a detailed insight into various compression techniques widely disseminated in the deep learning regime. They have become key in mapping powerful RNNs onto resource-constrained devices. While compression of RNNs is the main focus of the survey, it also highlights challenges encountered while training. The training procedure directly influences model performance and compression alongside. Recent advancements to overcome the training challenges with their strengths and drawbacks are discussed. In short, the survey covers the three-step process, namely, architecture selection, efficient training process, and suitable compression technique applicable to a resource-constrained environment. It is thus one of the comprehensive survey guides a developer can adapt for a time-series problem context and an RNN solution for the edge.},

abstract = {In Medicine Deep Learning has become an essential tool to achieve outstanding diagnosis on image data. However, one critical problem is that Deep Learning comes with complicated, black-box models so it is not possible to analyze their trust level directly. So, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to build additional interfaces for explaining how the model has reached the outputs by moving from the input data. Of course, that's again another competitive problem to analyze if such methods are successful according to the human view. So, this paper comes with two important research efforts: (1) to build an explainable deep learning model targeting medical image analysis, and (2) to evaluate the trust level of this model via several evaluation works including human contribution. The target problem was selected as the brain tumor classification, which is a remarkable, competitive medical image-based problem for Deep Learning. In the study, MR-based pre-processed brain images were received by the Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (SSLW-CNN) model, which includes additional operators to reduce the complexity of classification. In order to ensure the explainable background, the model also included Class Activation Mapping (CAM). It is important to evaluate the trust level of a successful model. So, numerical success rates of the SSLW-CNN were evaluated based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), computational time, computational overhead, and brain tumor classification accuracy. The objective of the proposed SSLW-CNN model is to obtain faster and good tumor classification with lesser time. The results illustrate that the SSLW-CNN model provides better performance of PSNR which is enhanced by 8%, classification accuracy is improved by 33%, computation time is reduced by 19%, computation overhead is decreased by 23%, and classification time is minimized by 13%, as compared to state-of-the-art works. Because the model provided good numerical results, it was then evaluated in terms of XAI perspective by including doctor-model based evaluations such as feedback CAM visualizations, usability, expert surveys, comparisons of CAM with other XAI methods, and manual diagnosis comparison. The results show that the SSLW-CNN provides good performance on brain tumor diagnosis and ensures a trustworthy solution for the doctors.},

abstract = {Despite efforts to support students with disabilities in higher education, few continue to pursue doctoral degrees in computing. We conducted an interview study with 12 blind and low vision, and 7 deaf and hard of hearing current and former doctoral students in computing to understand how graduate students adjust to inaccessibility and ineffective accommodations. We asked participants how they worked around inaccessibility, managed ineffective accommodations, and advocated for tools and services. Employing a lens of ableism in our analysis, we found that participants’ extra effort to address accessibility gaps gave rise to a burden of survival, which they sustained to meet expectations of graduate-level productivity. We recommend equitable solutions that acknowledge taken-for-granted workarounds and that actively address inaccessibility in the graduate school context.},

abstract = {With the development of computer technology in our country, the vigorous development of higher education and the continuous deepening of higher education system reforms, intelligent computing has been integrated into the management system of universities, and significant changes have taken place in the content and functions of university management, and new changes have been proposed. As the backbone of students' ideological and political education, the team of college counselors is an important factor to ensure the continuous, healthy and rapid development of my country's higher education. The overall level and work status of the college counselor team will directly affect the effectiveness of ideological and political education and the realization of talent training goals. This article is based on the research of the university counselor incentive system based on intelligent computing. This article first uses the literature research method to analyze some problems in the incentive system of college counselors, and then proposes the necessity of reforming the incentive system for college counselors. Finally, it uses questionnaire surveys and quantitative analysis methods to analyze the work status of college counselors and how to deal with them. Research shows that the working conditions of college counselors are not very good. About 40% of counselors feel listless in their work, which may be related to the heavy workload. College counselors are dissatisfied with the incentive system, about 45% of them. It is possible that the incentive system of colleges and universities makes counselors not have great incentives for their salary and development.},

abstract = {Most CS students learn little about accessibility in higher education; this is partly because most CS faculty know little about accessibility. Unfortunately, higher education CS faculty lack a model of professional development for learning to teach new topics. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of a "micro" professional development model for teaching accessibility in CS courses that could be used at scale. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S. CS faculty, asking them to explore a prototype of a web-based professional development tool that linked accessibility topics to CS topics. We found that many organizational factors limited faculty's autonomy to integrate accessibility in many of their courses. We also found that individual values and knowledge constrained faculty's ability and willingness to both learn and integrate accessibility topics into their courses. However, many faculty expressed desire to teach accessibility in their courses if they had access to even basic accessibility content and materials to use in their courses.},

In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the AMA, drawing on empirical evidence from moral psychology to point out several challenges to these proposals that have been largely neglected by AI ethicists. In particular, we suggest that the AMA at its current conception is fundamentally misaligned with human moral psychology - it incorrectly assumes a static moral values framework underpinning the AMA's attunement to individual users, and people's reactions and subsequent (in)actions in response to the AMA suggestions will likely diverge substantially from expectations. As such, we note the necessity for a coherent understanding of human moral psychology in the future development of AMAs.},

abstract = {Small and Medium-sized Enterprises play an essential role in the growth of the global economy. The access to credit for these companies allows them to fund the development of their activities. Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a potential tool to help financial and insurance institutions to assess Small and Medium-sized companies and thus, accelerate their activities. The economic sector in which companies operate is an essential factor when it comes to determining the risk of default. On the other hand, to introduce Artificial Intelligence in a highly regulated industry, the principal actors need to understand the behavior of the models. In this paper, we focus on the development of Artificial Intelligence-based models for different economic sectors Furthermore, we analyze the model behavior using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We compare both the performance and the explanations of the different economic sector models with the global model. Our study shows that there is a slight improvement in terms of performance when creating the different sectorial models. The comparison between the explanations for each model reveals certain disagreements in terms of the most relevant features.},

abstract = {Text in one language can be mechanically translated into another language using machine translation (MT). It is possible to anticipate a sequence of words, generally modeling full sentences using machine translation in a single integrated model. Human language's flexibility makes automatic translation an artificial intelligence (AI) challenge of the highest order. A single model rather than a pipeline of fine-tuned models is now the best way to attain state-of-the-art outcomes in machine translation. For example, words having numerous meanings, phrases that use more than one grammatical structure, and other grammar issues make it difficult for a machine to translate; however, many misinterpretations translate to be a breeze. A teacher's job is to assist pupils in overcoming the emotional and cognitive obstacles that stand in the way of developing effective problem-solving abilities. Students will benefit from developing problem-solving abilities since they will apply what they have learned to new circumstances. MT-AI, machine translation technology, and products have been employed in a wide range of applications, including business travel, tourism, and cross-lingual information retrieval. Text translation and phonetic translation are two types of translations that focus on the content of the source language. It is possible to create self-learning systems by injecting machine learning techniques into existing software and then observing the results of such injection. Computer software can translate a massive volume of text in a short period. It takes longer for a human translator to perform the same work as a computer program. The simulation investigation is developed based on correctness and effectiveness, demonstrating the proposed framework's reliability of 95.1%.},

However, researchers have mainly directed their attention to general education students and seemingly ignored higher education undergraduates. This study aims to examine this relationship under other dimensions of EAP such as the breadth and the intensity on university students of a Vietnamese educational institution. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was utilized with two data collection instruments: a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The quantitative data in the first phase revealed no statistical significance between EAP and students’ academic performance (e.g., time on homework, lateness for school, skipping classes, and missing sessions) while the qualitative information in the second phase uncovered a very small effect size of EAP on those outcomes.},

Even if we restrict the context to Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd), what once were just fictional displays are rapidly becoming a reality. But which society layers and ethical frameworks are being considered in the process of conceiving AIEd scope? Given this context, this research aims at exploring ethical challenges of AIEd in terms of sense of agency development across formal education. It uses a mixed method approach, starting with an expert consultation though the Delphi Method. The results of its iterations are presented in this paper. Further on, its conclusions will enable the implementation of a focus group with teachers that will be the basis for the selection of a syllabus for an eLearning course on AIEd. The final insights of this research are expected to mainly reinforce understanding on AI applied to Education, contributing to the public interest, debate, understanding, and further research on AIEd, through the development of theoretical frameworks to analyze and incorporate its critical dimensions into deliberate pedagogical practices.

abstract = {Existing approaches to teaching artificial intelligence and machine learning often focus on the use of pre-trained models or fine-tuning an existing black-box architecture. We believe advanced ML topics, such as optimization and adversarial examples, can be learned by early high school age students given appropriate support. Our approach focuses on enabling students to develop deep intuition about these complex concepts by first making them accessible to novices through interactive tools, pre-programmed games, and carefully designed programming activities. Then, students are able to engage with the concepts via meaningful, hands-on experiences that span the entire ML process from data collection to model optimization and inspection.},

In a global survey, 2,300 security managers reported that 59% of their security positions were unfilled, although 82% anticipated cyberattacks to their systems [2]. At the same time, the cybersecurity field is broadening, not only in technical concepts but also in human factors, business processes, and international law. The field has not become culturally diversified, however. Professionals hired in 2018 included only 24.9% women, 12.3% African Americans, and 6.8% Latinos [3]. These realities create an opportunity for higher education: diversify the profession while increasing the numbers of skilled computer scientists. New and integrated methods of attracting student populations in the field of cybersecurity are needed. This working group report analyzes the outcomes and approaches used in higher education to diversify the cybersecurity field through a review of the literature, identification of gaps, and recommendations for cybersecurity education researchers and practitioners.},

The stability and accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been improved, making voice more critical in the transaction process and voice consultation of e-commerce purchases. ASR matches the learning model based on contextual cues. Eliminating unnecessary text plays an important role. We use the LSTM model and change it to contextualized custom text. In addition, to use our robot for testing, we propose a multi-task model that can jointly perform content re-scoring and has excellent responsiveness in the text of the input entity. Therefore, this article recommends using ASR technology to interpret and predict the answers to the LSTM model, allowing users to obtain expected results from actual measurements and understand which aspects are suitable for predicting specific emotions tested on this group. This article discusses chatbots and the design techniques used in platform translation, early and modern chatbots combined with ASR and artificial intelligence technology.},

abstract = {Students starting STEM courses have very heterogeneous knowledge, especially regarding computer science and mathematics. As a result, many students are struggling to keep up with the high demands of higher education institutions, and lecturers are under pressure to compensate for the lack of knowledge without lowering their standards. The struggle to keep up combined with personal worries, as well as doubts regarding studying in general, can lead to uncertainty and frustration. The MINT-KOMPASS project at our institution aims to support students of the STEM study courses during their first semesters and, therefore, tries to minimize problems early on. As part of the project, successive surveys were conducted as well as a statistical analysis of the development of the student's grades. In this paper, we present the results of both as well as two measures implemented to support the students in areas identified as problematic. With the surveys and measures, we try to better understand the needs of our students and, as a result, hope to eventually achieve our long-term goal of supporting the students and relieving the lecturers.},

The portfolio of analysis methods for those large amounts of simulation data still yields potential to further development, and new methods emerge frequently. Especially the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence is difficult, since a lot of those methods are very good at approximating data for prediction, but less at actually revealing their underlying model of rules. To overcome the lack of comprehensibility of such black-box algorithms, a discipline called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has gained a lot of traction and has become very popular recently.

abstract = {Rapid advances in artificial intelligence are driving applications of robotics and automation in transport and logistics, providing new solutions to highway systems, passenger transport, last-mile delivery, and automated warehouses. Because the environment is dynamic and not entirely knowable, human supervision will be needed for the foreseeable future to solve unexpected problems. Research in other domains suggests that human-robot teams may even offer the optimal solution, as the relative strengths of human and artificial intelligence can be combined. However, realizing human-robot complementarity is challenging because sophisticated AI techniques lead to increasingly opaque robot control programs, and operators’ cognitive capacities can be exceeded as the sizes of autonomous fleets grow. We present our vision and initial results for a framework for human supervisory control and human robot teamwork for automated multi-vehicle systems.},

abstract = {When evaluating the quality of university education, the employment situation of university graduates is a very important indicator. Strengthening the monitoring of employment status of college graduates is not only the realistic need of promoting higher education to coordinate with social and economic development and building a powerful country with human resources, but also the objective need of higher education's own survival and development. In order to better grasp the employment situation of college students after graduation, sum up the more comprehensive employment situation of universities so as to update the university rankings in time, and let parents and children have more reference when choosing schools, it is inevitable to build a network system for monitoring the employment situation of college students. This paper analyzes the current situation of the dynamic monitoring mechanism of college graduates' employment and entrepreneurship, and puts forward the optimization method of the dynamic monitoring system of graduates' employment situation based on data mining technology. Universities should adopt a variety of data mining methods to mine the employment data of previous graduates, and put forward suggestions on the reform of university teaching and the revision of personnel training programs.},

abstract = {With the continuous progress of science and technology, artificial intelligence and big data are also constantly evolving. In artificial intelligence, the 2D image recognition of deep learning is relatively mature, but the 3D point cloud image is still in development. Because the data of 3D point cloud is larger than that of 2D image, and the scanning method is different, which affects the point cloud image to generate different data types. For various reasons, the development of 3D point clouds still requires us to make more efforts to study how to improve them. With the continuous expansion of the data size, the computing performance becomes more important, and in deep learning, the convolutional layer occupies a very important position. If the performance can be improved in the convolutional layer, it will definitely bring good benefits to artificial intelligence, so this paper will propose the use of efficient reuse, depthwise separable convolution, quantization, and Winograd algorithm to accelerate the operation and reduce the weight. Finally, according to the digital integrated circuit design process based on the standard cell library, the convolution layer operation in the neural network is realized.},

This course is mandatory for students majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. AXolotl was used as part of an optional lab assignment bridging clausal reasoning and SAT solving with classical reasoning, proof construction, and first-order logic. The app provides an intuitive interface for proof construction in various logical calculi and aids the students through rule application. The goal of the lab assignment was to help students make a smoother transition from clausal and decompositional reasoning used earlier in the course to inferential and contextual reasoning required for proof construction and first-order logic. We observed that the lab had a positive influence on students' understanding and end the paper with a discussion of these results.},

One idea in order to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems more explainable is to use cognitive methods that humans use when reasoning. For instance, argumentation is a common method that humans use when they explain an opinion [13]. In this paper, we introduce a framework that produces the visualization of an explanation from an argumentation dialogue, and can be easily understood by any user. More specifically, we utilize the argumentation tree that Gorgias returns [7] for the acceptability of an argument, to create a graph that represents the explanation of the argumentation tree.},

abstract = {A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.},

Culture is an important part of general education. To strengthen general education through culture is the fundamental task for application-oriented universities to carry out "cultivating people by virtue" and an important support for cultivating high-quality talents. In order to fully understand the development of general education in application-oriented universities, to find out the relationship between culture and general education, and to better carry out general education, this paper adopts the method of questionnaire survey among 1783 college students. Statistical analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to analyze the questionnaire data. Through analysis, on the basis of understanding the current situation of general education in application-oriented universities, it is of great significance to find out the influence of various cultures on general education, and then to carry out general education for application-oriented universities effectively.},

The Pragmatism paradigm used in this research, as a philosophy is intricately related to the mixed-method approach, which is largely quantitative with the research design being a survey and an experiment, but supported by qualitative approaches where Focus Group discussions were held. The Artificial Intelligence paradigms evaluated include machine learning methods, autonomous robotic vehicles, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic. Alternative improved solutions discussed include the use of machine learning algorithms specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Tree C4.5, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).},

We have presented the prototype, together with the approach we used to design and develop it by considering the concepts of ‘Recontextualisation’ and ‘Quality Function Deployment’. We argue that the use of chatbot technology can not only help tutors develop online education and teaching materials but may also improve the quality of educational services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of recommendations and further work suggested by domain experts have also been highlighted in this paper in order to improve our prototype further.},

VQA is a tool that can enrich possible answers by combining both visual and textual information. It is also trivial to extrapolate to a game setting without going away from the training domain. In this Work In Progress, we present two original prototypes designed to explore the potential of VQA in games and discuss preliminary findings originated through a Wizard of Oz (WOz) pilot study using VQA to investigate how people interact with such an AI algorithm.},

Unfortunately, AI courses do not typically cover accessibility. When teaching ethics in AI, discussions on bias and fairness cover user diversity in terms of gender and race, but not disability. To address the lack of teaching accessibility in AI courses, we conducted a pilot study to explore what and how accessibility topics can be integrated into an AI course, titled Natural Language Processing (NLP). We added to the NLP course some general and quick accessibility topics through means such as a short guest lecture, a programming assignment and a final project that connect accessibility and AI. We gathered student feedback through a pre-survey, a post-survey and interviews with five students. The course we looked at took place synchronously in an online setting using Zoom. In this context, we observed how implementing accessibility topics remotely into the course affected students in their knowledge of accessibility and disability.},

abstract = {Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the online learning experience.},

A critical issue in coalitional games is the formation of coalitions, which depends closely on players' payoffs, viz., players' preferences. In this work, we consider the reason of players' preferences in coalitional games. We propose a refined modelling of coalition games by incorporating a priority structure called priority graph. Priority graphs encode the features of game choices and their priority (or weight), from which players' preferences can be induced. A new definition of the solution core for coalitional games is proposed. The dynamics of the priority structure for players and its influence on players' preferences are also studied.},

abstract = {As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user’s and each item’s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation. We publish the source code at https://github.com/newlei/FairGo.},

abstract = {This paper, shows the authors' efforts to determine the riskiness of academic modules at a South African University. In determining the modules at risk, the authors used a hybrid of sequential and cyclical methodological approaches, based on a context-aware business intelligence framework. The risk indicators derived from academic module enrolment data elements, were weighted and aggregated to determine the riskiness of a module. The results showed that the riskiness of a module can be zero, weak, strong and extreme. Depending on the riskiness of a module, the institution can determine the appropriate intervention strategies for students to succeed in passing the module. This work proves to be essential for program and module reviews which are important quality assurance exercises within the South African higher education institutions.},

abstract = {Social media is unarguably one of the wealthiest sources of information. The opinions shared on social platform have an immense influence towards the brands equity. Social media has flourished with platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, etc. However, over the past decade, Instagram, one of the most famous photo posting social media, has dominated the youth's attention with its unique feature of being the first ever photo sharing application. Over the years, large-scale data of user activity has been collected by researchers, yet not a single research reflects the scope of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework to social media. By applying the advanced frameworks of AI, we can acquire the capability to analyze the content of social media. This content analysis enables us to be privy to numerous brands on social media, namely, retail branding, fashion branding, and, education branding, etc. In this paper, we propose a framework for education branding in social media. Our approach redefines social intelligence by helping students choose their school and provide insight on the rapid growth of the university through ranking, trending sports teams, newly introduced courses, real-time student feedback and future goals of the universities. This case study enables us to interpret social media in a complete innovative view.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses are a type of virus that can cause a variety of disorders and exist in different types. COVID-19 is derived from a special type of a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, discovered in 2019. Approximately two years ago, COVID-19 was discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and it has since become a worldwide source of concern. A COVID-19 confirmed patient is experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Based on the results of laboratory tests and/or chest X-rays, the COVID-19 diagnosis is established. When it comes to research using chest CT scans /X-ray for the diagnosis of COVID-19, which is based on medical imaging, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly being applied in a variety of ways. Machine learning and deep learning are fields of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data that was acquired in order to better understand the origins of COVID-19. The outcomes of applying such an approach will aid in a better understanding of the nature of the threat and how it might be mitigated. For this reason, this work gives an overview of deep learning and machine learning approaches for the detection of COVID-19. Several COVID-19 detection methods are discussed in detail, as well as the issues, current challenges associated with artificial intelligence and medical researchers' approaches to providing a comprehensive assessment of detecting COVID-19.},

With the increasing usage of application of artificial intelligence requirements for more complexity presentations of XCS have become more critical. And learning multiple problems is a subject that was needed but few one studied. To dynamically learn multiple problems during a single learning process, we applied a novel representation of classifier conditions of the XCS, named Sensory Tag (ST) to achieve this goal. The XCS with the ST as the input representation is called XCSSTC. The experiments of the proposed method were conducted for the single step problems. The potential of XCSSTC's use in future application of artificial intelligence clearly needs further exploration.},

Studies demonstrate that personalized learning may support students’ development of new skillsets as well as scaffold lifelong learning practices, reduce time spent on learning, and mitigate information overload.&nbsp;While the research in K-12 and Higher Education is promising, research into personalized learning&nbsp;strategies&nbsp;in Workforce Training and Development Programs has been somewhat limited.&nbsp;Additionally, a literature review revealed that definitions and implementations of personalized learning vary in regard to&nbsp;what is being personalized (distribution channel, interface, content, functionality), who conducts the personalization (user,&nbsp;system, blended format), how the&nbsp;(user,&nbsp;system, blended format)&nbsp;personalizes, and&nbsp;the type of learner data collected.&nbsp;This research sought expert feedback in identifying the variables, characterizations, priorities, and applications of personalized learning in Workforce Training and Development Programs.&nbsp;Three rounds of Delphi Feedback indicated that experts conceive of personalized learning as a learner-centered strategy driven by content and social interactions and underpinned by an ethos of flexibility and learner choice.&nbsp;A 5 Level Personalized Learning Interaction Framework (PLiF) building upon Moore's Theory of Interaction is proposed to structure personalized learning for Workforce Training and Development Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},

abstract = {Humans are increasingly relying on complex systems that heavily adopts Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Such systems are employed in a growing number of domains, and making them explainable is an impelling priority. Recently, the domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) emerged with the aims of fostering transparency and trustworthiness. Several reviews have been conducted. Nevertheless, most of them deal with data-driven XAI to overcome the opaqueness of black-box algorithms. Contributions addressing goal-driven XAI (e.g., explainable agency for robots and agents) are still missing. This paper aims at filling this gap, proposing a Systematic Literature Review. The main findings are (i) a considerable portion of the papers propose conceptual studies, or lack evaluations or tackle relatively simple scenarios; (ii) almost all of the studied papers deal with robots/agents explaining their behaviors to the human users, and very few works addressed inter-robot (inter-agent) explainability. Finally, (iii) while providing explanations to non-expert users has been outlined as a necessity, only a few works addressed the issues of personalization and context-awareness.},

abstract = {In this paper, the defect simulator for high voltage sulfur hexafluoride gas insulated composite electrical apparatus is developed. The device consists of four parts: sulfur hexafluoride gas chamber, solid insulator, defect simulator, observation and measurement device. The defect simulator can effectively simulate free metal particle discharge, tip discharge, suspension discharge and air gap discharge. A real-type integrated defect simulator based on GIS is developed, and the partial discharge signal is tested on the simulator, the change trend of decomposed gas with time is detected. Based on this, an artificial intelligence classification method combining fuzzy ISODATA algorithm and ant colony algorithm is proposed, and the structure parameters of the two algorithms are optimized by PSO algorithm. The field application results of HV combined electrical appliances show that the proposed method is effective. The fault type diagnosis method can effectively judge the fault mode intelligently according to time series of SF6 micro-decomposition gas and typical micro-decomposition gas. This paper not only collects the original classification data from the hardware platform of the defect simulator, but also develops an artificial intelligence classification algorithm software system which is easy to be programmed. It can be directly and effectively used to diagnose and evaluate the type of insulation defect in the field practical engineering of GIS. It has certain theoretical guidance value for GIS equipment fault diagnosis and pattern recognition.},

abstract = {In this paper we share interim results of an ongoing mixed method evaluative study of 43 students enrolled in an elective course “Doing Business with A.I.” at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB), Singapore Management University. A key component of the course design is an experiential chatbot workshop that provides non-STEM students with an opportunity to acquire basic skills to build a chatbot prototype using the ‘Dialogflow’ program. The workshop and the experiential learning activity were designed to impart students with relevant knowledge and skills such as conversation and user-centric design know how and know why that are transferrable to other situational contexts beyond the course. Based on ongoing class surveys and qualitative interviews with students, we are trying to corroborate a conceptual model developed from learning theories and models related to technology mediated learning (TML) aimed at measuring the effects of a hands-on knowledge-based chatbot workshop designed by the authors on students’ engagement and motivation as drivers of acquiring AI-related competencies such as natural language processing skills (NLP). One important didactical aspect during the design and roll-out of the chatbot workshop is that novice learners with no or very little knowledge about A.I. recognize and create the important linkage between knowledge inputs and outputs of NLP-powered conversational agents (chatbots) so that user queries are effectively addressed. The knowledge-based chatbot workshop design as described in the paper provides useful practical information for instructors interested in designing educational chatbot prototypes for effective digital teaching and learning in a business school (higher education) context that can be transferred to other organizational units beyond the university (e.g. quality customer service) in order to make learners future-ready.},

abstract = {The continuous evolution of technology in Biomedicine has given satisfactory answers for several complex diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the major neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, belongs to this category. So far, no cure reverses or stops the biological changes that occur in the brains of patients; however, the early diagnosis and early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease is a crucial step in reducing the burden on both the patient and the caregivers. One of the predominant ways to deal with this difficulty is by integrating artificial intelligence and large-scale biomedical data. In this direction, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution data, which can be decrypted through artificial intelligence tools. In recent years, the research community has shifted to deep learning methods applied to medical images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In the present work, we propose a hybrid (called CNN-SVM) model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to predict the early AD stages from MRI. Our results showed that the proposed CNN-SVM model outperforms other well-known algorithms supporting the more effective AD diagnosis.},

These technologies also affect the cultural and national heritage. IoT generates large volumes of streaming data; therefore, advanced data analytics using big data analytics and artificial neural networks is an important research topic. In this study, IoT sensor data was collected at the restored Woljeong Bridge, which was originally built in the eighth century, or AD 760, during the Silla Dynasty (57 BC--AD 935) in South Korea. We empirically evaluate a recurrent neural network with recurrent units, including a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). Additionally, we evaluate hybrid deep-learning models (convolution neural networks [CNN]-LSTM and CNN-GRU) to build a prediction model, facilitating the preventive conservation of an invaluable cultural and national heritage site. The experimental results show that the LSTM unit is an effective and robust model. When comparing the hybrid models (i.e., the joint CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU architectures), we found that the vanilla LSTM and GRU models had superior time-series prediction capabilities.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its popularity in many fields of our life, ranging from song recommendation to lung cancer identification. CSE can impart AI knowledge to all people (including teachers) so that they can make an informed decision about AI. Besides, AI technologies can support tailoring the education to the students’ needs or unload teachers by doing routine work for them and leaving more space for creativity. However, despite the growing potential of AI applications in education, some skepticism or even rejection can be observed. It could be especially critical for teacher education: by being a role model for pupils, teachers could multiply their attitude towards AI while transferring it to the pupils. Although AI acceptance is broadly investigated in the marketing context, there is not much prior research on AI acceptance among teachers. Besides, AI acceptance as a term is questionable due to the heterogeneity of the AI field. We highlight the research gap, propose an instrument for the data collection, and introduce the idea of the acceptance spectrum. The proposed concept is exemplified by the case study of acceptance of the AI-supported homework assessment among pre-service teachers.},

Further, digital literacy is increasingly being recognised as an essential skill, on a par with literacy and numeracy, to support job readiness. As a result there is increasing pressure on universities to ensure their courses prepare graduates appropriately, but is digital literacy amongst these skills? The first step to address this question is to gain an understanding of what universities' expectations are of a student's assumed digital literacy knowledge, the foundation from which graduate digital capabilities are built. The aim of this study is to investigate what information Australian universities provide to prospective students to inform them of the expectations of assumed digital literacy knowledge when entering a course. Based on a sample of 13 Australian universities it seems that minimal information is being provided to new students. This study demonstrates that there is no shared understanding of what digital literacy entails, which poses challenges for students who are expected to have an ill-defined and in some instances, unknown set of digital skills. It also challenges relationships between staff and students, as expectations and understanding of digital skills are not aligned.},

This has led to the under-representation of the female gender in many professions. Most of the Artificial Intelligence-Natural Language Processing (AI-NLP) models learning from these underrepresented real world datasets amplify the bias in many cases, resulting in traditional biases being reinforced. In this paper, we have discussed how gender bias became ingrained in our society and how it results in the underrepresentation of the female gender in several fields such as education, healthcare, STEM, film industry, food industry, and sports. We shed some light on how traditional gender bias is reflected in AI-NLP systems such as automated resume screening, machine translation, text generation, etc. Future prospects of these AI-NLP applications need to include possible solutions to these existing biased AI-NLP applications, such as debiasing the word embeddings and having guidelines for more ethical and transparent standards.},

This research paper aims to identify the impact(s) of simulation-based virtual learning environment on postgraduate students' learning abilities. To achieve the learning objectives; positive relations between simulations and students learning are gathered based on the systematic review of the literature. A successful use of simulations depends on four factors: the role of the instructor, integration in the course, the courses' technical specifications and, the practical exposure as an integrative dynamic virtual learning environment. We utilized a quantitative methodology to compile data from online bloggers and analysed the content. The findings in this paper reveal that students from all groups, disaggregated by gender and ethnicity, showed significant learning gains after playing these challenging simulation games. We also present some recommendations that can help alleviate some of the constraints experienced by institutions of higher education that integrate simulations into classrooms.},

abstract = {The concept of artificial intelligence has long captured the imagination of popular culture, perhaps even inspiring some to pursue formal study in computer science. There is a growing interest in an offshoot of the basic idea of machine intelligence called "socially intelligent computing," which is not focused on independent machine intelligence, but on how systems that involve machines and people through different forms of interactions create new types of intelligent systems. Today's entering college freshman are often already experienced with collaborative technologies and social computing systems, so it makes sense to consider introducing topics on socially intelligent computing in introductory computer science courses. This is because there is a clear connection between social computing and socially intelligent computing, and these topics might also provide some students with a new incentive to consider pursuing formal study in computer science. In this paper, a framework is presented for teaching socially intelligent computing principles at the level of an introductory Computer Science course.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to IT systems. However, AI can be manipulated to perform undesirably, exhibit biases or abusive behaviors. When AI algorithms are parallelized on high-performance computing-based cyberinfrastructure (CI), such misbehaviors and uncertainty can multiply to obscure the root causes. Secure, safe, and reliable computing techniques can mitigate these problems. The project described in this paper aims to inform curriculum and develop materials to educate students who use AI from the outset, so that they will first become aware of the issues and secondly practical considerations will be integrated with theory in classes. Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to rapidly upgrade the skills of current and future CI users, so they can apply new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be taken as standalone self-directed units or integrated into existing classes, starting with CS 1 and CS 2, which are taken by many non-CS STEM students. In a sandpit environment, learners take measured risks when guided on a journey of discovery. The primary purpose of this paper is to present key findings of the research following a 2-year pilot. A secondary purpose of the paper is to disseminate this exciting endeavor broadly, so that likeminded educators and researchers can consider participating in the project.},

Egypt, a country facing socio-economic challenges, has been investing in an increasingly growing ICT infrastructure and human capital. The current ICT workforce is technically-oriented due to the increasing interest in global outsourcing. However, there is a need for a Computer Science (CS) workforce that is willing to engage with the bottom-of-the-pyramid users as a potential market. CS students should harness interdisciplinary skills that enable them to sympathize with users who have diverse backgrounds, perceptions, and digital literacies. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education programs could provide the necessary skills for local CS students to fulfill this workforce gap. Like many Arab and African countries, Egyptian higher education programs and industry have been slow in recognizing the value of HCI.In this article, I address how introducing HCI education to students in an Egyptian engineering institute can benefit industry. I discuss a series of action research cycles focusing on the learning design of a student-centered introductory HCI short course that successfully sensitized students to the role of end-users in technology design. The learning design was planned to circumvent the challenging fact that HCI was underrated by CS students. Formative assessment results and my reflections, as the instructor, are discussed as well.},

The different strategies compete in a software environment that implements it. Grading this part of the course depends on the results obtained in the competition. Additionally, before running the competition, students have to read the source code written by their classmates and bet a part of their grade on other teams' results. This way, they elaborate a critical analysis of the source code written by other programmers: a very valuable skill in the professional world. Students that are not so proficient in coding are still rewarded if they demonstrate they can do a good analysis of the source code written by others.},

Aiming at the problem of insufficient cultivation of students' innovative ability in the existing blended teaching mode, this paper puts forward a theoretical teaching method based on four-stage and problem-oriented in the offline class, and a practical teaching method based on "entrepreneurial thinking". In the former teaching method, by dividing the explanation of a concrete theoretical knowledge into four stages: "concept", "problem", "application" and "innovation", and at the same time, designing some progressive problems in each stage to guide students to deepen their knowledge understanding and inspire their innovative thinking around the application and innovation of knowledge, and an example has been given to well illustrate the method. Meanwhile, in the latter teaching method, this paper also presents a practical teaching method based on "entrepreneurial thinking" to optimize the practical teaching links of the courses in IT major, in which the project-based teaching method and entrepreneurial thinking are adopted , and the practical process is divided into several stages as "demand analysis and topic selection", "scheme design", "scheme implementation" and "application and promotion", At each stage, some concrete guiding measures and examination and evaluation methods have been designed to effectively stimulate students' innovative thinking and innovative ability specific. Through the application of the above methods to the teaching practices in the "computer network" course, it is proved that this method plays a promoting role in the development of students' innovation and practical abilities.},

abstract = {The increasing pressure of college students has become a social problem that has received widespread attention. Biologists’ research has shown that natural environments and highly “controlled” settings (such as botanical gardens) can help participants and observers reduce stress and maintain calm and peace. According to research published in the Journal of Environment &amp; Behavior, those who spend time observing large aquariums or even smaller fish tanks may improve their physical and mental health. Virtual reality technology is the crystallization of the rapid development of computer software and hardware technology, sensor technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and behavioral psychology. It can give users an immersive sense of immersion and a perfect interaction with the environment. Ability has been widely used in many fields such as medicine, entertainment, and education, and has provided more possibilities for the development of traditional technologies. This article simulates the "natural (aquatic) environment" through a virtual aquarium based on VR technology, and takes students from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China as the survey object, using the form of questionnaires, and using the results of questionnaires and heart rate measurements to determine whether college students are affected by species abundance and the influence of fish abundance. The project will provide evidence that VR technology can help college students reduce their stress.},

abstract = {Transforming the latent value of big data into real value requires the great human intelligence and application of human-data scientists. Data scientists are expected to have a wide range of technical skills alongside being passionate self-directed people who are able to work easily with others and deliver high quality outputs under pressure. There are hundreds of university, commercial, and online courses in data science and related topics. Apart from people with breadth and depth of knowledge and experience in data science, we identify a new educational path to train "bridge persons" who combine knowledge of an organization's business with sufficient knowledge and understanding of data science to "bridge" between non-technical people in the business with highly skilled data scientists who add value to the business. The increasing proliferation of big data and the great advances made in data science do not herald in an era where all problems can be solved by deep learning and artificial intelligence. Although data science opens up many commercial and social opportunities, data science must complement other science in the search for new theory and methods to understand and manage our complex world.},

abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to an increased use of algorithm-generated user-adaptivity in everyday products. Explainable AI aims to make algorithmic decision-making more transparent to humans. As future vehicles become more intelligent and user-adaptive, explainability will play an important role ensuring that drivers understand the AI system's functionalities and outputs. However, when integrating explainability into in-vehicle features there is a lack of knowledge about user needs and requirements and how to address them. We conducted a study with 59 participants focusing on how end-users evaluate explainability in the context of user-adaptive comfort and infotainment features. Results show that explanations foster perceived understandability and transparency of the system, but that the need for explanation may vary between features. Additionally, we found that insufficiently designed explanations can decrease acceptance of the system. Our findings underline the requirement for a user-centered approach in explainable AI and indicate approaches for future research.},

abstract = {Fault diagnosis is a vital problem in process engineering. It is the fundamental component of anomalous event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention over recent years. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid anomalous event evolution, improve uptime and reduce efficiency loss. There is a great quantity of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modeling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the gamut, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historical process data. In this paper we present the performance of few approaches of data driven modeling/machine learning techniques on the simulated data from a distillation column.},

However, not all students possess the competency required to self-regulate their learning independently. Students need guidance and support in developing the skills to self-regulate their learning. The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify factors that influence university students' self-regulation of learning. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) based Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis revealed that students' goal, employment prospects, self-efficacy, metacognitive knowledge, prior learning experience, peer influence and family influence have a significant effect on university students' self-regulation of learning. Employment opportunities and teaching staff significant were also found to have an indirect impact on students' self-regulation of learning. Based on these results, the role of the teaching staff, academic managers, teaching and learning support staff as well as students themselves are discussed, together with the advancement of future research and practice in the facilitation of self-regulated learning in higher education.},

abstract = {Abstract. The security of the elderly in an aging society has become a social problem attracting much attention, among which the problem of secondary injury caused by the fall has attracted wide concern of researchers. The application of fall detection combined with artificial intelligence technology has become an important application in the security field of smart care for the elderly. After analyzing and judging the human body features, this paper found out that the combination of human skeleton and fall detection technology could be used to identify the fall behavior and link it with the alarm system to solve the security problem of smart care for the elderly. The experimental results showed that the recognition rate of fall detection was increased by 2% after adding optimization of genetic algorithm factors and contrast calculation of prediction frame length in the process of human feature target detection.},

abstract = {Emotional Self-Awareness (ESA) plays a vital role in physical and mental well-being. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have shown promising emotion recognition results, opening new opportunities to build systems to support ESA. However, little research has been done to understand users' perspectives on artificial-intelligence-based emotion recognition systems. We introduce Troi, an automatic emotion recognition mobile app using wearable signals. With Troi, we ran a multi-day user study with 12 users to understand user preference parameters, such as perceived accuracy, confidence, preferred emotion representations, effect of self-awareness of emotions, and real-time use cases. Further, we extend our study to evaluate the machine learning model in-the-wild to understand behaviours in-the-wild. We found that users perceived accuracy of the emotion recognition model is higher than the actual model prediction accuracy; there was no strong preference for one specific emotion representation, and users' self-awareness of emotions improved over time.},

abstract = {Knowledge representation is one of the most difficult tasks for students in introductory Artificial Intelligence courses. We study the impact of varying levels and types of scaffolding in teaching students how to model automated planning problems in a first-order logic-like language called the planning domain definition language (PDDL). We select two well-known problems: the sliding tile puzzle and the towers of Hanoi for our evaluation. The results suggest that scaffolding does increase proficiency, and that the type of scaffolding gives rise to different obstacles in learning. We discuss these learning obstacles and implications that they have upon the modeling process.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly augmenting and generating online content, but research suggests that users distrust content which they believe to be AI-generated. In this paper, we study whether introducing a confidence indicator, a text rating of an algorithm's confidence in its source data alongside rationale for why the data is more or less trustworthy, affects this distrust in Airbnb host profiles believed to be computer-generated. Our results indicate that a low-confidence indicator decreases participant trust in the rental host, but high-confidence indicators have no significant impact on trust. These findings suggest that user trust of AI-generated content can be negatively, but not positively, affected by a confidence indicator.},

abstract = {With traditional classes moving to online platforms and the need for online content growing exponentially, there is a deficit of customized content that helps students understand concepts well. It is the need of the hour to have round the clock support and resources to ensure smooth transition and continuity of academics. Our solution proposes the use of RASA, an open-source conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework, to support students with contextual help and provide them with resources like specific slides of a presentation or real-world problems discussed in class in the form of a Virtual Teaching Assistant. It can also ask leading questions to provide tailored answers. Its responses are based on the material the Instructor teaches in class, making it relatable to the students, unlike generic responses. The Contextual Virtual Teaching Assistant will also assist the Instructor in identifying students that need additional help with academics, answering queries related to upcoming tests or assignments, and can even alert students about deadlines},

abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence education, it is of great significance to establish a scientific and effective model of learners' knowledge mastery state. Knowledge tracking (KT) as a modeling method for learners to infer knowledge level based on their learning achievements, plays a key role in intelligent education system. There are some problems in the existing knowledge tracking models, such as incomplete input features and unstable model. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction of learners' learning effect, this paper proposes a deep knowledge tracking model (DDKT) based on the comprehensive difficulty of the topic. The model mainly includes two parts: on the one hand, the construction of the comprehensive difficulty model, on the other hand, the improvement of the model. The model combines topic difficulty with deep knowledge tracking model, enriches learners' learning process dimensions and improves the generalization ability of the model. Through comparative experiments, it is proved that the DDKT model has achieved better results.},

CITA is relatively easy to implement across a variety of higher education institutions, because it repurposes existing courses and resources in computer science and the arts. CITA is relatively easy to implement across a variety of higher education institutions, because it repurposes existing courses and resources in computer science and the arts. At our institution, this involves three tracks (music, visual art, and theatre). CITA incorporates four synthesis courses, one per academic year, which help students interweave the two distinct curricular experiences into a cohesive whole in preparation for their capstone project. CITA has been fully implemented at the authors' institution. In the three years of its existence, it has increased participation in computer science by 23% mainly from an underserved population (students interested in the arts). Approximately 40% of these students are women. While these students are not necessarily strong in mathematics, they tend to be strong in design and creativity, thus enriching the pool of computing professionals with people able to envision new technologies and surprising innovations. Such people are fully versed in computer science so they can easily collaborate with more traditional computing professionals such as software engineers and scientific programmers. We discuss our successes, and provide pointers for others to establish similar degree programs, including potential challenges and lessons learned.},
