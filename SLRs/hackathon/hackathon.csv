article,Implementation and Evaluation of a Virtual Hackathon in an Urban HSI Community College during COVID-19,"This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.","Azhar, Mohammad Q. and Haynes, Ada and Day, Marisa and Wissinger, Elizabeth",No data,No data,2023,13
article,Successful Models of Hackathons and Innovation Contests to Crowdsource Rapid Responses to COVID-19,"To help fighting the many adversarial effects that the COVID-19 pandemic brought, many initiatives supported by public, private and non-governmental organizations are crowdsourcing the development of solutions through hackathons and innovation contests.

article,Skill Development and Self-Efficacy for High School Girls via Virtual Hackathons,"This paper presents a virtual hackathon model for high school girls that was designed to mitigate the barriers to the gender gap in computer science. Through building Apps that solve real-world problems relevant to their communities, participants worked collaboratively to build competency, self-efficacy, and identity with computing. Six virtual hackathons were offered since summer 2020, successfully supporting 167 students, among them, 33% Latinas and 7.2% African Americans. Analyses of post-event survey responses, the Apps submitted by project teams, and judging scores and feedback pointed to students' growth in technical and professional skills, computing identity, and self-efficacy. Participants with little to no prior computing experience successfully demonstrated improved coding skills such as using variables, conditional and iterative statements, functions, and data tables. They also developed software engineering skills in teamwork, project management, and effective communication.","Gutta, Sreedevi and Ouyang, Youwen and Ochanji, Moses K.",No data,No data,2023,8

article,Curricular Hackathons for Engineering Design Learning: The Case of Engineering Design Days,"Contribution: This article defines “curricular hackathons” and describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and integrative design problems. Background: Design is an essential part of engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for formative design practice. Research Question: How can the hackathon format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology: The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and implementation. Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some level of integration and/or embedding in a program’s curriculum.","Rennick, Christopher and Litster, Greg and Hulls, C.

article,Female Participation in Hackathons: A Case Study About Gender Issues in Application Development Marathons,"Hackathons are events that are a sort of application development marathons - lasting between 24 and 48 hours - that became increasingly popular as a method for fast learning and bring people in a short space of time to make creative projects. However, the number of women participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers, designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.","Paganini, Lavínia and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/RITA.2020.3033209,2020,10

article,Crowdsourcing Properties and Mechanisms of Mega Hackathons: The Case of Junction,"Hackathons are time-bounded crowdsourcing events, which have recently prospered in many technology and science domains across the globe. We study Europe’s largest hackathon, Junction, to better understand the distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of this type of hackathon as a form of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Moreover, we determined how they add value to attending companies and participants. In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed. Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection, strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential, and pervasive information technology. Based on our findings, we argue that these properties and mechanisms increase the possibility of finding innovative solutions to companies’ problems in Junction-like mega hackathons.

article,Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease Outbreaks Through Hackathons,"Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.","Pakpour, Nazzy and Nouredini, Sahar and Tandon, James",,10.1109/TE.2022.3159150,2022,9

article,Crisis Innovation: Leveraging Virtual Hackathons for Rapid Ideation,"The COVID-19 crisis brought about an unprecedented wave of interest into rapid ideation and innovation. Among others, the pandemic triggered a series of collaborative innovation events&#x2014;so-called hackathons&#x2014;to leverage the power of the crowd for crisis response. In contrast to earlier hackathons, these events are different in their speed of mobilization, global scale, and their fully virtual nature with organizers and teams being geographically dispersed. Analyzing this new empirical phenomenon, we characterize COVID-19 hackathons against other forms of innovation crowdsourcing and describe challenges and best practices in the areas of people management, session management, technology, and knowledge management. Based on our empirical findings, we develop a conceptual framework that emphasizes the importance of managing virtual crisis hackathons as the integrated sum of its different parts. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate how open innovation efforts such as hackathons can be leveraged for crisis management and more generally for ideation activities in increasingly remote working environments. This article contributes to crowdsourcing research by highlighting key differences of virtual hackathons from the traditional crowdsourcing approaches and hackathons investigated by prior research. Moreover, we affirm the value of mobilizing knowledge from different sources, particularly from a broad spectrum of civil society.","Yokoi, Tomoko and Obwegeser, Nikolaus and Beretta, Michela",,10.1109/TEM.2021.3097238,2021,13

article,An Exploration of Hackathons as Time Intense and Collaborative Forms of Crowdsourcing,"Crowdsourcing has attracted increasing attention as an open innovation tool that enables firms to access the ideas and solutions of external crowds of participants. Among various crowdsourcing formats, hackathons have emerged as a form of collaborative crowdsourcing that emphasizes team-based collaboration among participants to co-create solutions to firms’ challenges under intense time pressures. Despite their increasing popularity, limited focus has been placed on understanding how hackathons should be organized and managed and the challenges that these time-intense collaborative events generate for both firms and participants. Based on a qualitative, multiple case study of six on-site hackathons, we identify and discuss four key design practices that shape these collaborative crowdsourcing forms, namely 1) problem formulation; 2) participant attraction and team composition; 3) developing the evaluation system; and 4) facilitating idea development. We show that these design practices are interrelated, with decisions about one design practice having important implications for the others, and discuss key challenges that arise from their combination. Overall, our findings highlight how organizing and managing hackathons is a complex matter that requires firms to adopt a more holistic and complementary approach. Implications for innovation management research and practice are discussed.","Beretta, Michela and Obwegeser, Nikolaus and Bauer, Stefan",,10.1109/TEM.2022.3174712,2022,15
article,LYSTO: The Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon and Benchmark Dataset,"We introduce LYSTO, the Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon, which was held in conjunction with the MICCAI 2019 Conference in Shenzhen (China). The competition required participants to automatically assess the number of lymphocytes, in particular T-cells, in images of colon, breast, and prostate cancer stained with CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Differently from other challenges setup in medical image analysis, LYSTO participants were solely given a few hours to address this problem. In this paper, we describe the goal and the multi-phase organization of the hackathon; we describe the proposed methods and the on-site results. Additionally, we present post-competition results where we show how the presented methods perform on an independent set of lung cancer slides, which was not part of the initial competition, as well as a comparison on lymphocyte assessment between presented methods and a panel of pathologists. We show that some of the participants were capable to achieve pathologist-level performance at lymphocyte assessment. After the hackathon, LYSTO was left as a lightweight plug-and-play benchmark dataset on grand-challenge website, together with an automatic evaluation platform. LYSTO has supported a number of research in lymphocyte assessment in oncology.

article,A Study of Cybersecurity Education Using a Present-Test-Practice-Assess Model,"Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats; consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance; 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance; and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities.","Workman, Michael D. and Luévanos, J.

article,Factors Influencing Hackathon Adoption for Learning Information Technology (IT) Programming Modules,"Hackathon as a social event has been identified as a method that assists participants collaborate and solve technical design challenges in a limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South African IT programming students. The results indicate that relative advantage (beta = 0.142, rho = 0.045), perceived usefulness (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.036), performance expectancy (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.002) and self-efficacy (beta = 0.330, rho = 0.000) have a positive influence on the behavioural intention of students to adopt hackathon for learning IT programming. The hackathon adoption model was developed for higher education. This research helps in the adoption of hackathons in higher education.","Oyetade, Kayode Emmanuel and Zuva, Tranos and Harmse, Anneke",hackathon; higher education; information technology; computer programmin,10.18421/TEM113-22,2022,7
article,Health hackathon as a venue for interprofessional education: a qualitative interview study,"A Health Hackathon provides an opportunity for healthcare professionals to collaborate with IT developers and designers to solve health issues using technology and thus serves as a potential venue for interprofessional education. The present paper reports the views and experiences of participants on how the KKU mHealth Hackathon 2017 served as a venue for interprofessional education. A phenomenological approach was used involving semi-structured in-depth interviews of three faculty members and three students who participated in the hackathon. Participants expressed their learning experiences during the event, as well as factors that promoted or hindered learning. Our findings suggest that a health hackathon can serve as a suitable venue for interprofessional education as interviewees reported how they had learnt to successfully collaborate in interprofessional teams, move beyond their prior views and appreciate complementary work from other professions, focus on solving problems practically, and create a collegial, collaborative atmosphere. There were also some potential downsides of the hackathon that could be solved with an improved design in future occasions. A Health Hackathon can be an important opportunity for interprofessional education. Further studies should focus on methods to reproduce these positive learning experiences, mitigate the negative aspects, and investigate their long-term effects.","Pathanasethpong, Atipong and Areemit, Rosawan and Teerakulpisut, Daris and Morley, Katharine and Morley, Michael",Hackathon; interprofessional education; mHealth; qualitative method,10.1080/13561820.2019.1696760,2020,3

Aim This research aimed: to explore health professions educators' sustainable healthcare education (SHE) knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices across 13 health professions courses in one Australian university. Methods Utilising a sequential mixed-methods design: Phase one (understanding) involved an online survey to ascertain educators' SHE knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices to inform phase two (solution generation), `Teach Green' Hackathon. Survey data was descriptively analysed and a gap analysis performed to promote generation of solutions during phase two. Results from the hackathon were thematically analysed to produce five recommendations. Results Regarding SHE, survey data across 13 health professions disciplines (n = 163) identified strong content knowledge (90.8\%); however, only (36.9\%) reported confidence to `explain' and (44.2\%) to `inspire' students. Two thirds of participants (67.5\%) reported not knowing how best to teach SHE. Hackathon data revealed three main influencing factors: regulatory, policy and socio-cultural drivers. Conclusions The five actionable recommendations to strengthen interdisciplinary capacity to integrate SHE include: inspire multi-level leadership and collaboration; privilege student voice; develop a SHE curriculum and resources repository; and integrate SHE into course accreditation standards.","Brand, Gabrielle and Collins, Jorja and Bedi, Gitanjali and Bonnamy, James and Barbour, Liza and Ilangakoon, Chanika and Wotherspoon, Rosie and Simmons, Margaret and Kim, Misol and Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna",Education environment; integrated; public health; leadership; roles of teacher,10.1080/0142159X.2020.1844876,2021,9
article,Employing Technology Industry Methods to Facilitate Transformative Learning Experiences in the Classroom: Insights From a Pilot,"High-impact, transformative educational practices change the way students see themselves and others, as well as impart knowledge. Practices from the technology industry may offer innovative strategies for fostering transformational learning experiences. We developed and implemented two innovation techniques-Hackathon and Innovation Time Off (ITO)-in a graduate course on social psychology and public health nutrition. The Hackathon occurred in the sixth and seventh weeks of the course; the last 4 weeks provided 10\% of class time for ITO projects. All enrolled students participated in the pilot study (n = 6; M age = 27.5 years; 83\% female; 67\% White) and completed reflection papers during the final exam period. Student learning was assessed from these reflection papers using a rubric for transformative versus nontransformative changes in five areas: confidence, pride, skills, perspective, and identity. Student responses revealed transformative changes in perspective (n = 7). Additionally, nontransformative changes were found in confidence (n = 1), identity (n = 2), perspective (n = 4), and skills (n = 9). This pilot work suggests that the Hackathon and ITO contributed to perceived skill-building in problem-solving and teamwork, and the Hackathon may have led to transformative changes in perspective; ITO may not be appropriate for learners who need structure; high confidence remained unchanged; and these strategies are likely to be feasible and replicable.","Shonkoff, Eleanor T. and Fitopoulos, Theodore and Folta, Sara C.",public health education; transformative learning,10.1177/2373379920925109,2021,8

article,Global Surgery Hackathons: A Case Study From Pakistan,"Background. Hackathons aim to solve problems in a selected field by bringing together people from multiple domains and combining their expertise. Global surgery is an emerging field with a huge burden of disease and massive implications for bettering health care. In this study, we describe the first Global Surgery Hackathon held in Pakistan and analyze the impacts of the hack and post-hack incubation. Methods. This research study used data collected from a Hackathon held at the Aga Khan University (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and progress from the post-hack incubation teams. Data were collected from applications, from sign-in attendance, via evaluation forms, and milestone tracking of the incubation teams. A list of factors such as sectors addressed by winning projects and grants received was made. Results. The evaluations provided by the participants were positive, with mean scores of 4.00 (SD = .78) out of 5 on a Likert scale. Pitches made (n = 69, 68\%) by the 109 participants were sorted into 5 categories: workplace, access, quality, safety, and design. Fifteen teams were formed, out of which 5 were accepted for incubation. All teams had a minimum viable product at the one-year mark. Conclusion. Hackathons are a reliable way to come up with effective solutions for targeted problems in various areas of health care and using the methodology of a Hackathon, a pool of low-cost, innovative solutions can be generated. These solutions can definitely impact health outcomes, especially for the field of global surgery. Further statistics should be collected to affirm the incubated solutions' impact.","Butt, Waqaas A. and Shariff, Amir and Khan, Sadaf and Mian, Asad I.",Aga Khan University; critical creative innovative thinking forum; global surgery; hackathon; incubation; innovation; low-middle-income country; Pakistan,10.1177/15533506211018619,2021,6
article,Healthcare hackathons: fostering medical education through innovation in a developing country: a case study from Pakistan,"Background Hackathons aim to develop solutions to preidentified problem domains and catalyse startup cultures.

In this study, we make the case for utilisation of hackathons as an alternative teaching and learning tool geared towards entrepreneurship and as an opportunity for interprofessional integration. Methods This research study followed up with participants from the third hackathon at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. Hack MedEd was about solutions to problems of undergraduate and postgraduate medical education with an emphasis on low--income to middle-income countries. Participant evaluation data were filled at the end of the hackathon and gathered from three focused group discussions (FGDs): immediately before and after the event, a delayed follow-up after 11 months was recorded. Results Of 116 participants, the majority (71\%) were under 30 years old, and over half were female. The evaluations provided by hackers were positive overall with a mean score of 4.37 out of 5 on a Likert Scale. During the FGDs, participants spoke positively of the process and felt that, by the end of the hackathon, they had learnt something new. In the delayed follow-up FGD, teams that had undergone incubation expressed that they had gained a critical and simple skillset that they might not have acquired otherwise.

One way of fostering sustainability in the hospitality industry is through sustainability hackathons, which are intensive events focusing on ``hacking{''} new sustainability ideas. This paper critically explores how the hospitality industry designs and executes sustainability hackathons within the context of EfS. An exploratory case study was conducted on the Scandic Hotels chain. Data utilised including both relevant reports and in-depth interviews with the highest level of management of Scandic. The execution of the sustainability hackathon illuminates how value-based education, creative problem-solving and co-opetition were critical aspects to foster EfS in the hospitality industry. Moreover, the hackathon facilitators, i.e. the hotels' General Managers, were found to play an essential part in shaping the sustainability education and the event's potential impacts. This paper contributes to expand knowledge on EfS offered by the hospitality industry (as opposed to EfS in formal educational institutions) and make practical recommendations on how sustainability hackathons could be better facilitated by hotel chains.","Phi, Giang Thi and Waldesten, Ted",Sustainability hackathons; education for sustainability; tourism; value-based education; hotel chains,10.1080/15022250.2021.1879669,2021,17

article,Discovering civic educational hackathons: an exploratory study,"Educational hackathons are a new way to respond to some of the biggest challenges in education. This exploratory study seeks to define the key elements of these hackathons and to offer a theoretical and practical starting point for future publications and research. A literature review is carried out, with the information then contrasted with the experience as organizers of EDhack Raval, the first community-focussed educational hackathon in Catalonia. Observations, a questionnaire and interviews are used to add depth and objectivity to the wealth of data derived from field work. The results point to the valorization of the freedom of the creative process, the generation of community networks and social learning over the creation of solutions, findings that coincide with the latest research. Thus, the study concludes that educational agents would do well to appropriate, adapt and evaluate the assets of the hacker culture, making sure not to commit the error or organising hackathons that promote solutionism, elitism and competition.","Garo, Hector and Riera, Jordi",Hackathon; community education; civic participation; educational innovation; hacker culture,No data,2020,11

article,Assessing accessibility: an instrumental case study of a community music group,"Creating accessible events is a pressing issue for many music organisations. In the United States, the term accessibility has strong ties to disability, and it is an important concept because what is deemed accessible directly impacts who is included and excluded from music experiences. Music Community Lab (MCL) runs a series of events in New York City called Monthly Music Hackathon NYC. They aim to promote `diversity across backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities'. This instrumental case study sought to examine how MCL participants conceptualise accessibility as well as analyze participants' suggestions for improving the accessibility of MCL events. Sixty-two people who attended one of three MCL events completed a demographic survey and 57 of those respondents participated in an interview. Findings reveal that 63\% (n = 36) of participants associated accessibility with inclusivity and 35\% (n = 20) of participants associated accessibility with ease of access to resources, places, and experiences. Participants' suggestions for improving accessibility included social media marketing (n = 23; 40\%) and ease of access approaches (n = 11; 19\%) including CART, ASL, and live streaming events. Accessibility is challenging for community music groups like MCL to navigate because it is a complex construct with varied interpretations.","Bell, Adam Patrick and Datoo, Atiya and Matterson, Brent and Bahhadi, Joseph and Ko, Chantelle",accessibility; disability; community music; music technology; hackathon,10.1080/14613808.2022.2038111,2022,14
article,"Organizing innovation contests for public procurement of innovation - a case study of smart city hackathons in Tampere, Finland","Public procurement of innovation is a key policy instrument for improving the quality of public services and achieving wider benefits for society. Recently, innovation contests have re-emerged as a means to procure innovative new solutions. There is, however, limited understanding of how innovation contests should be organized in the public sector. In this study, we investigate the organization of two smart city hackathon-style innovation contests in Tampere, Finland. We examine the contests' structure and goals, the definition of a problem statement, the motivation of potential participants, and their outcomes. We find that innovation contests may be used for, not only sourcing novel technologies, but also for engaging in conversations with companies, and developing an understanding of local problems and potential solutions. We further discuss the issues that arise from the integration of multiple goals in a single contest. We provide practical guidance for organizing innovation contests and evaluate their role for public procurement of innovation and local development.","Pihlajamaa, Matti and Merisalo, Maria",Innovation contest; public procurement; innovation; hackathon; smart city,10.1080/09654313.2021.1894097,2021,19
article,Using the Hackathon Model in Social Work Education,"A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57) developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5), evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of social work curricula including the teaching of various research methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and e-consultation might benefit from Hackathon brainstorming.","Cwikel, Julie and Simhi, Meital",Hackathon; cooperative learning; social work innovation; small group technique; trauma course content,10.1080/02615479.2021.1910654,2022,14

article,Evaluating the implementation of a pharmacy hackathon pilot,"Background and purpose: The need for disruptive innovation within the pharmacy profession is well documented in the literature. However, there is a lack of proper training on innovation and creative thinking for student pharmacists and limited time or incentive for health care practitioners to be innovative. Hosting an innovation event, such as a hackathon, can teach innovative strategies and incentivize innovation by student pharmacists. Thus, the aim of this study was to to assess the feasibility and student perception of an inaugural school of pharmacy hackathon pilot. Educational activity and setting: A hackathon pilot was planned on a distant site campus. Over the course of four months, a planning team, consisting of a faculty member and a student leader in the American Pharmacy Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists, met every other week to plan the event. Outcomes included: change in student excitement and interest related to the hackathon, number of participants, and change in student confidence in the ability to perform steps in the innovation process. Findings: The average level of excitement prior to the event increased, and student confidence related to the ability to perform each step in the innovation process improved. Additionally, students agreed that they would be interested in attending a similar event in the future and would recommend the event to a friend. Summary: Hosting a healthcare hackathon at a school of pharmacy is an enjoyable way for pharmacy students to practice and gain confidence with innovation skills while addressing Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education Standard 4.3.","Cox, Sarah R. and Barchet, Adam C.",Hackathon; Innovation; Health design; Entrepreneurship,10.1016/j.cptl.2023.09.008,2023,5

article,Hacking systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): outcomes of the Waterlupus hackathon,"Introduction: There is a growing literature demonstrating the benefits of engaging knowledge-users throughout the research process. We engaged a multi-stakeholder team to undertake a hackathon as part of an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) process to develop nonpharmacological interventions to enhance the economic lives of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aims of this research were to (1) increase understanding of the economic challenges of living with SLE through stakeholder engagement at a research hackathon; (2) investigate possible interventions to improve the economic lives of individuals affected by SLE in Canada; and (3) document the outcomes of the Waterlupus hackathon. Methods: Waterlupus was held at the University of Waterloo in May 2019, attended by lupus advocacy organization representatives, researchers, physicians, individuals with lived experience and students. We conducted participant observation with participants' understanding and consent; notes from the hackathon were qualitatively analyzed to document hackathon outcomes. Results: At the conclusion of the 28-hour hackathon event, five teams pitched nonpharmacological interventions to address the economic challenges of living with SLE. The winning team's pitch focussed on increasing accessibility of affordable sun-protective clothing. Other Waterlupus outcomes include increased awareness of SLE among participants, and professional and informal networking opportunities. Conclusion: This paper contributes to a limited literature on health hackathons. The successful outcomes of Waterlupus emphasize the value of hackathons as an iKT tool.

article,Hackathon in Differentiated English for Specific Purposes Instruction of Information Technology Students,"The current study aims to check the effectiveness of differentiated English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction using the hackathon. This study used the mixed research method. The participants of the study were 24 Information Technology (IT) students of the Physics and Technology Institute of National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute{''} who voluntarily took part in the study in 2022-2023. They were divided into two experimental groups and differentiated according to the social roles and the level of English language proficiency. Sensory, interactive and graphic scaffolding as the temporary assistance was integrated in the educational process. As shown by the results of the experimental learning, the second group, where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was defined by both students and teachers, demonstrated significantly better results than the first group, where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was defined by IT students only. Scaffolding should be regulated by both the teacher and the students. It was concluded that the use of hackathon with a focus on learners' differentiation helps to diversify ESP learning at technical university and facilitates the development of professional communicative skills (speaking and writing) as well as other soft and hard skills.","Synekop, Oksana",differentiated English for Specific Purposes instruction; IT students; hackathon; scaffolding; foreign language communication competence in speaking and writing,10.4995/muse.2023.19966,2023,17

article,Fostering interdisciplinary working within global surgery at an undergraduate level: A hackathon based approach,"Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual hackathon in fostering interdisciplinary working amongst undergraduate students in global surgery. Methodology: In this study, we developed a 3 day event consisting of guest lectures, a documentary screening and a hackathon supported by academics and experts in the field, to provide students with the opportunity to learn more about and work in interdisciplinary teams within global surgery. Students had the option to attend just the lectures or both the lectures and hackathon. Quantitative and qualitative results were collected through a pre and post session survey. Results: A total of 21 responses were received for the hackathon and 26 responses for the general event (response rate for event = 26 \%, response rate for hackathon = 24.7 \%). There was a significant improvement in understanding of interdisciplinary working in global surgery between the pre and post-session survey, with an increase in median from 3 (IQR = 2-3.5, n = 21) to 4 (IQR = 4-5, n = 21) (p < 0.05). Respondents noted that the benefits of a hackathon were that it was very engaging, and brought in diversity of thought and expertise. The drawbacks to the hackathon were that it was fast-paced, required prior knowledge and the virtual platform it was hosted on. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that hackathons are an effective, inclusive and equitable way for students to engage in and learn about interdisciplinary working. It is important that as institutions recognise and develop global surgery courses, these courses reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the field.","Veerappan, Vigneshwar R. and Kumar, Niraj S. and Selvakumar, Jashan and Kakwani, Mehak and Marks, Katya M.

article,How We Do It: Creation of a Workforce Development-Focused Track at a Surgical Hackathon,"OBJECTIVE: Healthcare hackathons are fast-paced, mentored events that bring together individuals with diverse skillsets to identify clinical needs and propose solutions. Traditionally geared toward device development and workflow optimization, platforms that address women and minorities in surgery are rare. We aimed to expand the traditional healthcare hackathon model to include a novel workforce development (WD) track to address concerns faced by surgeons and trainees. DESIGN: The WD track was created as part of the first surgical hackathon at our academic institution. In a single-day event, participants identified concerns (pain points) of diversity and sustainability in surgery, formed interdisciplinary teams, and pitched solutions. Pain points, project themes, and postevent survey results were analyzed and compared between WD and other tracks. SETTING: Participants were surveyed at Yale School of Medicine, an academic medical tertiary center, in September 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one total participants. Twentyfive (80.6\%) responded to the survey. RESULTS: Of 57 problem pitches, 23 (40.4\%) were related to WD. Issues highlighted 5 themes: training and career exploration, leadership and communication of skills, mental health and burnout prevention, surgeon discrimination and harassment, and work-life balance. Participants formed 6 groups, with 1 focused on WD. There was no difference between participants in the WD track and non-WD track counterparts with regard to excitement for continuing their project beyond the hackathon (4.00, standard deviation {[}SD] 0.89, vs. 3.63, SD 1.12, p = 0.43), and in their perception of the mentorship they received (4.00, SD 1.00, vs. 4.11, SD 0.78, p = 0.84). The project presented within the WD track, on culturally sensitive scrub wear, was 1 of 3 prizewinners. CONCLUSIONS: The first WD track at a healthcare hackathon identified 5 themes of unmet workforce needs. The pilot demonstrated that WD tracks can be implemented in hackathons with similar results to traditional tracks and create innovative and sustainable solutions to surgical workforce concerns.

article,Numerical Simulation of Urban Inundation Processes and Their Hydraulic Quantities - Tsunami Analysis Hackathon Theme 1 -,"The detailed understanding of tsunami hazard risk using numerical simulations requires a numerical model that can accurately predict tsunami inundation phenomena on land. In such models, the structural effects are indirectly considered using the variation of bottom roughness as a proxy for the differences in building densities. Only a few studies have conducted inter-model tests to investigate tsunami inundation in complex coastal urban cities. During the tsunami analysis hackathon held in September 2020, eight research groups met to have a detailed discussion on the current urban inundation problems. In this study, we conducted an intermodel comparison of the numerical tsunami models, using the data from physical experiments that were performed on a detailed urban model. Our objective was to investigate the necessary conditions of an accurate numerical model based that can ensure high reproducibility and practicality. It was confirmed that the accuracy of topographic data is an important parameter for tsunami inundation simulations in complex urban areas. Based on the computational cost and accuracy, we suggest that a resolution of 1 cm of topographic data is a sufficient condition for tsunami inundation simulations on 1/250 scale model.","Yasuda, Tomohiro and Imai, Kentaro and Shigihara, Yoshinori and Arikawa, Taro and Baba, Toshitaka and Chikasada, Naotaka and Eguchi, Yuuki and Kamiya, Masato and Minami, Masaaki and Miyauchi, Toshiharu and Nojima, Kazuya and Pakoksung, Kwanchai and Suppasri, Anawat and Tominaga, Yuho",tsunami analysis hackathon; tsunami inundation simulation; numerical models; topography data; reproducibility,10.20965/jdr.2021.p0978,2021,16

article,Learning sustainable work through critical design: a case study of a hackathon to prepare the future workforce,"Purpose This paper aims to explore the future of work by investigating how work can be practiced to meet global sustainability goals. The authors draw from empirical findings from a case of critical design session with university students. The aim of the design session was, on the one hand, to embed sustainability into education and, on the other hand, to prepare students with necessary conceptual tools to be prepared for future work. The research questions explored are: What do students learn through engagement in critical design, and how can that foster sustainable work? Design/methodology/approach The research approach is a case study, drawing on critical design activities with 45 students at a university course. The data consists of students' reflections on their design efforts and one researcher's field notes from the design session. Findings The findings show that the students engaged in critical design learn different aspects of sustainable work: how to be solution oriented, how to use technology to do good in the world and outside-the-box thinking skills. Originality/value The authors contribute extended insight into what it means to work for sustainable development, hence doing sustainable work, and how sustainable work can be conducted in practice. The authors discuss three dimensions of sustainable work that we argue are essential to understand how professionals can work towards increased sustainability. The three dimensions are: participation-based work, practice-based work and context-based work.","Islind, Anna Sigridur and Norstrom, Livia",Sustainability; Critical design; Future work; Sustainable work,10.1108/JWL-05-2020-0082,2020,11
article,Feasibility of a citizen-driven hackathon to increase public engagement and solutions to address the opioid crisis,"Background: Interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address complex societal problems, such as the opioid crisis. We sought to explore the feasibility and potential issues encountered in planning and implementing a 24-hour hackathon competition to bring together teams from law enforcement, public health, and data science to develop solutions to the opioid epidemic. Methods: We enlisted an advisory board and planning committee, including key stakeholders (e.g., high-level representatives from government agencies) to plan the event. Teams completed an online registration form with questions about team composition. Each team captain completed a survey at the event describing prior experiences with their team, knowledge and interest around the opioid epidemic, and hackathon expectations. Results: Twenty-nine teams (108 individuals) registered. Seventy-six percent had a technical/engineering background. Participants were from industry (55\%), academia (30\%), public health/medicine (9\%), and government/public policy (6\%). Nineteen teams attended the event. Team captains were primarily 18-29 years of age, had moderate experience and interest in the opioid crisis, and had never attended an opioid-related event. Conclusions: It is feasible to implement a 24-hour opioid-focused hackathon and recruit teams/participants from a broad range of disciplines.

article,Open innovation in the face of the COVID-19 grand challenge: insights from the Pan-European hackathon `EUvsVirus',"Being a grand challenge of global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic requires collective and collaborative efforts from a variety of actors to enable the expected scientific advancement and technological progress. To achieve such an open innovation approach, several initiatives have been launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular tool that has gained some momentum during COVID-19 times is hackathons, which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time, with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3-day online hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus-related challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective open innovation in the face of COVID-19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, both urgent action and long-term thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the `usual suspects', through knowledge recombination with atypical resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on open innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level.","Bertello, Alberto and Bogers, Marcel L.

article,Is hackathon in oncology a plausible way to foster innovation? An experiential narrative account of conducting Hacking Cancer,"Background Hackathons are a popular trend in the technology domain and is considered a powerful tool to spur creativity and innovation. In a health hackathon, an interdisciplinary team of health, technology and management experts work collaboratively to solve a common problem. Health hackathon can be one of the quickest means to derive technology or process-based solutions to the challenges faced by clinicians. Methods A 2-day hackathon: Hacking Cancer was conducted at a tertiary cancer centre in India to develop quick, cost-effective solutions in cancer care. Twelve oncology-related problem statements were explored. Undergraduate and postgraduate students of health and dental sciences, pharmacy, nursing, engineering and business management were the participants. Outcomes One hundred and fifty-seven participants expressed interest, and 90 participated in the event. The participants did a time-bound exploration of 12 challenges in oncology elucidated problem statements. The oncology specialists mentored the participants during the hackathon. Seventeen teams presented their solutions. Judges reviewed the solutions and scored the teams based on feasibility, relevance and applicability. The top-scoring three projects were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) better-improving adherence to treatment in ALL patients, Donate Life-application for voluntary blood donation and Lumiflex-a novel illuminated flexible abdominal retractor. They received seed funding to develop prototypes and implement their ideas. Conclusion Hacking Cancer was an effective way of developing quick, cost-effective solutions to the common problems faced in cancer care. The pool of local participants developed solutions that were relevant and applicable to the practice setting. This one was the first oncology themed hackathon in the country.","Lewis, Shirley and Rao, Chythra R. and Shenoy, Padmaja Ananth and Salins, Naveen and Viveganandan, Rangan and Shanbhag, Arun and Mukhopadhyay, Chiranjay and Prabhu, Krishnananda and Rao, Sharath K.",No data,10.1136/bmjinnov-2020-000464,2021,11
article,14 examples of how LLMs can transform materials science and chemistry: a reflection on a large language model hackathon,"Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a hackathon. This article chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon. Participants employed LLMs for various applications, including predicting properties of molecules and materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge from unstructured data, and developing new educational applications. The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines. We report the findings of a hackathon focused on exploring the diverse applications of large language models in molecular and materials science.","Jablonka, Kevin Maik and Ai, Qianxiang and Al-Feghali, Alexander and Badhwar, Shruti and Bocarsly, Joshua D. and Bran, Andres M. and Bringuier, Stefan and Brinson, L.

article,Youth social innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines: a quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses from a crowdsourcing open call and online hackathon,"Introduction Young people have played a pivotal role as part of the COVID-19 response, including developing health messages and social innovations. Social innovation in health engages multiple stakeholders in linking social change and health improvement. The study examined the feasibility of youth ideas and innovations to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses. Methods In partnership with the WHO, academic institutions, youth organisations and civil society groups, we conducted a crowdsourcing open call among Filipino youth (15-30 years old) using a structured Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases/Social Innovation in Health Initiative process. The open call had three categories: youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID-19 world (entries were texts, images, videos and music), youth-led COVID-19 social innovations, and youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19. Each submission was evaluated by three independent judges. Finalists were selected in each of the categories alongside four grand winners. All finalists were invited to attend a 1day online civic hackathon. Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID world=76; youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17; youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon provided the participants mentorship for further development of their ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication campaigns and improved social innovations. Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation call is recommended.","Ulitin, Allan and Mier-Alpano, Jana Deborah and Labarda, Meredith and Juban, Noel and Mier, Abigail Ruth and Tucker, Joseph D. and Tang, Weiming and Auplish, Mallika and Chan, Po-lin",COVID-19; public health; global health; social medicine; socioeconomic factors,10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000887,2022,8
