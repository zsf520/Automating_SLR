abstract = {Hackathons provide rapid, hands-on opportunities to explore innovative solutions to problems, but provide little support to teams in moving those solutions into practice. We explore the use of post-hackathon Learning Circles to connect hackathon teams with key stakeholders, to reflect on prototypes and consider business models. We conducted a qualitative field study with 4 post-hackathon teams on the theme of technology, social isolation, and aging. Our results show that Learning Circles are an effective way to involve stakeholders early in the development process, and to develop a deeper understanding of users, markets, and technology.},

abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons, code fests and others have become a global phenomenon. Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.},

abstract = {In this article we report a case study of a Language Learning Bauhaus VR hackathon with Goethe Institute. It was organized as an educational and research project to tap into the dynamics of transdisciplinary teams challenged with a specific requirement. In our case, it was to build a Bauhaus-themed German Language Learning VR App. We constructed this experiment to simulate how representatives of different disciplines may work together towards a very specific purpose under time pressure. So, each participating team consisted of members of various expert-fields: software development (Unity or Unreal), design, psychology and linguistics. The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes. We also provide guidelines on how to prepare the participants to work in rapid prototyping VR environments and benefit from such experiences in the long term.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional educational methods, forcing a quick transition to emergency remote learning. With the subsequent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, universities and society as a whole gradually resumed in-person activities. Students and university staff had to readjust to on-site learning and its associated challenges. This experience report specifically focuses on a course at University [omitted] dedicated to the design and development of Distributed Applications. Students engaged in a hybrid hackathon – an activity blending in-person and remote work – as part of the course. Despite their preferences for in-person collaboration, the majority of the students opted for remote participation. The goal of this report is to understand the students’ choices and adaptations to this new post-pandemic educational setting. We collected data through an anonymous survey and group interviews, revealing that the preference for remote work stemmed from convenience. Despite this, the distant collaboration allowed students to develop various soft skills. This exploration can shed light on future educational approaches in a world where online and in-person interactions can coexist.},

However, the number of women participating in such events is extremely low and worrying, and literature lacks empirical evidence about the reasons for that. This qualitative study gathers data and brings a discussion about this topic, as an attempt to understand better why women are not so interested in this type of event. We interviewed participants of a female-focused hackathon and tried to (1) understand reasons for women not participating in hackathons; (2) understand motivational aspects; and (3) understand the main problems concerning gender in hackathons.},

abstract = {The global pandemic of COVID19 demanded that professors rethink teaching strategies considering the use of online environments due to the social isolation stipulated to reduce the rate of contagion of the disease. A challenge for software engineering professors is to develop fundamental professional skills in students who are in the process of learning using these virtual environments. The purpose of this study is to identify how an online educational hackathon can support students of a Software Engineering program to develop professional skills. We also seek to understand how intense collaboration takes place between student teams, considering the digital context for the production of a technological solution. We conducted a Case Study on an educational hackathon that took place in the online context, collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. As some results, the skills that students most considered that this hackathon helped them to develop were communication, initiative, and creativity/innovation, among others. Also, the strategies of collaboration adopted by the students during this competition, considering the remote context. Therefore, the main contribution is the identification of how the realization of this event supported students to develop professional skills and to practice collaboration skills with each other.},

While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.},

We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.},

In this paper, we have developed an environment that enables non UI experts to quickly create car navigation prototypes by using traffic risk data. This paper includes our report on a hackathon that we held using this environment. The hackathon theme was "Develop a new car navigation system equipped with a mechanism that makes the driver aware of traffic risks and helps them determine the most appropriate driving routes." Twenty three researchers and professionals from the field of traffic engineering participated. Our results have brought certain common problems to the awareness of the experts. The information obtained from this report will be very beneficial for our community to determine the direction of collaboration.},

abstract = {Ultrasound haptics allows us to experience the sense of touch without contact with any physical surface. This novel "touchless" feedback can be used for various use cases but is not widely adopted nor incorporated in everyday products. The 2022 TOUCHLESS Hackathon aimed to enable novel practitioners to learn about touchless technology, generate new ideas, and implement prototypes. We invited participants to a 3-day hackathon in Copenhagen, Denmark, where we introduced touchless technology and provided novel touchless devices for prototyping use cases. Participants were joined by experts on ultrasound haptics, who helped them achieve their prototyping goals. Coming from various educational and national backgrounds, the participants approached the task in different ways and created four unique interactive prototypes. This event report introduces the TOUCHLESS Hackathon and reflects on the lessons learned.},

abstract = {Established companies often have difficulties developing new innovative products in a fast and creative way because of their fix structure and organizational complexity. With decision processes divided across several departments it takes too long to get all required skills and people onboard compared to more agile competitors. There are plenty of causes for organizational obstacles which hinder and slow-down the companies developing innovative products, particularly, within large companies having established processes and a lot of bureaucracy. From the perspective of the authors a set of means is required to tackle these organizational challenges as well to develop an innovation-friendly underlying corporate culture to enable the company identifying, developing, and selling innovative solutions in time. This paper introduces the concept of hackathons and describes how companies may consider hackathons as one means for overcoming organizational challenges and speeding-up the early phases of their innovation process up to the development and evaluation of prototypes. Although a hackathon can be applied for a variety of purposes, this paper focusses on its benefits for identifying, and developing innovative solutions and overcoming organizational hurdles on the path. Therefore, the Innovation-driven hackathon pattern is introduced and described in this paper from the perspective of practitioners.The authors aim at sharing practical experience with other industry experts as well as researchers and getting new insights concerning the application of hackathons and other means for optimizing the innovation process in the industry context.},

abstract = {Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.},

We present an explorative, autobiographical case study of a team at a hackathon and in the analysis we identify four factors, which in particular impacted the team's design judgement during the hackathon: 1) The hackathon format, 2) the available tools and materials, 3) the participants' domain knowledge, and 4) the participants' technical knowledge. Though the factors are evident in most design processes, we discuss how the four factors in a hackathon setting influenced the design judgement in a particular way and how the factors influenced the creative engagement in developing technology in the hackathon. We discuss potential implications for future research on how to understand design judgements made under the particular circumstances of a hackathon.},

abstract = {Collegiate hackathons are informal learning environments where students build new projects in a limited amount of time and often compete for prizes. Previous hackathon research has shown that students go to these events to learn new technical skills, work on projects with friends, or network with the technical community; however, little is known about the different ways in which students collaborate with other participants and how students' event goals affect their trajectory at the hackathon. In the literature, students are typically described as working in competitive teams that build one project to be entered into a competition. However, there are gaps when it comes to discussing other ways students may work together or what other non-competitive projects/activities students may want to engage with at a hackathon. This paper reports on different collaboration styles and event goals documented at a Spring 2018 female-focused hackathon. Findings include three types of collaboration styles: team-based, cooperative group, and individual participation; as well as four types of event goals: competition, exploration, dabbling, and observing. These findings can inform the collegiate hackathon literature and help hackathons diversify their events by offering insight into ways diverse participants choose to participate at a hackathon and offering design suggestions that mainstream collegiate hackathons can adopt to be more inclusive of different types of students.},

abstract = {The idea for this session is based on conversations with colleagues from computer science, art, communications, engineering, and biology as well as international colleagues from three continents at ITICSE-2016 on the use of Game Jams to increase participation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Computer Science and STEM education. High-impact practices are powerful tools in engaging students (NSSE, 2014), perhaps even more so for non-traditional, ESL/ELL, first-generation, and URM students in STEM disciplines by increasing peer and faculty contact, active learning, and high expectations (Goodman). We believe that event-based teaching, such as Game jams and Hackathons provide students with many, if not more of the experiences that are credited with those of commonly identified High Impact Practices (Kuh, 2008).These events also create peer and social networks among participants. While not conclusive - anecdotally the networks of peers and social capacity seem to make a difference in post graduation job search (Mouw). Game Jams and Hackathons are still relatively new in higher education, and while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence as to the benefits reaped by participants of these events, there exists little in the way of long-term studies in the literature that speaks to the academic value of these events.This session will create a conversation among faculty from computer science and other disciplines who are interested in creating these events and their institutions, and developing scholarship to fill in the gaps in the literature around the effects and efficacy of these events on the long-term success of participants.},

Three months after the event, we present an exemplifying analysis of the topics, used technologies and remaining activity of these projects. Shedding light on this instance of citizen science allows to highlight the potential of hackathons and startup culture regarding socio-technological resilience.

Studies show that learning is one of the primary motivations for people joining hackathons, where situated and collaborative learning take place. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. By taking that into account, we considered bringing hackathons into the classroom. This paper presents a case study of an Internet of Things (IoT) undergraduate course where a hackathon is used as a learning instrument, leveraging on challenge-based learning to motivate students to find and develop a suitable semester project. We utilize a mixed-method approach where quantitative and qualitative data are used to analyze the perspective of students about the effectiveness of that approach.},

This style of competition is more friendly to first and second year students, less competitive, less of a time commitment, and more collaborative. Two different competition formats are presented. The first is called "Problem Solving Speed Dating", which works by pairing upperclassmen and underclassmen in a speed dating type exercise. The second is called "Unwrapped Collaborative Problem Solving", where students work on a team but with very specific (and intentionally restrictive) roles. Both competition formats were tested in five different workshops over the course of several years involving around 250 undergraduate students.

abstract = {Hackathons are fast-paced events where competitors work in teams to go from an idea to working software or hardware within a single day or a weekend and demonstrate their creation to a live audience of peers. Due to the "fun" and informal nature of such events, they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum of students, especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In this paper, we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon events over the past two years, with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 student participants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events, we observed a significant amount of peer-learning -- students teaching each other how to solve specific challenges and learn new skills. The events featured mentors from both the university and industry, who provided round-the-clock hands-on support, troubleshooting and advice. Due to the gamified format of the events, students were heavily motivated to learn new skills due to practical applicability and peer effects, rather than merely academic metrics. Some teams continued their hacks as long-term projects, while others formed new student groups to host lectures and practice building prototypes on a regular basis. Using a combined analysis of post-event surveys, student academic records and source-code commit log data from the event, we share insights, demographics, statistics and anecdotes from hosting these hackathons.},

abstract = {Hackathons are time-bound collaborative computer science competitions increasingly popular at undergraduate institutions. It is often claimed that their failure-friendly environment helps students become better computer scientists. The same features which encourage risk-taking, however, may increase imposter syndrome and stereotype threat. Furthermore, if hackathons really do radically celebrate emergent projects, why do so many participants leave without showcasing their work? This work addresses two research questions: 1) Do students consider hackathons as a space which is safe for taking risks and learning through failure? And 2) How does participants’ perception of risk affect their decisions to persist or quit the main event competition? Extensive mixed methods data was collected from student attendees, professors, and industry sponsors of three undergraduate computer science hackathons. Constructionism was used to understand participant learning through making in a failure-friendly environment, and social cognitive career theory was used to determine how risk affects decisions on continued participation. Results showed participants largely felt that risk was good for learning, although they did worry about their classwork, health, meeting their own standards, and public embarrassment. They felt much more free to take risks than in their CS classes, and wanted 60% of the skills they used to be new. External conflicts or an unfinished project were the reasons that half of participants didn’t submit for judging. As almost 80% of hackathon attendees have CS related majors, these findings have implications for how risks can be productively used for learning both at hackathons and CS classes.},

abstract = {Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in representing and involving people with dementia in these events, which had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis presents insights into participants’ motivations, challenges participants faced when constructing their “absent user”, and the design features teams developed to address the social context of the user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for collaborative design events, community building through design, and reification in design.},

abstract = {In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities had to be done remotely as a way to avoid the spread of the disease. Instead of shifting to an online learning model, it consisted of a transition to what was called Emergency Remote Teaching. This is a strategy to keep activities going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles for students to continue engaged.Before the pandemic, hackathons -- short-lived events (1 to 3 days) of intensive collaboration to develop software prototypes -- were being explored as an alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an online hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their semester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency remote teaching period. We describe the intervention and analyze the students' perspective of the approach. One of the findings was the importance of the Discord communication tool -- used by students for playing games -- which helped them socialize and be engaged in synchronous group work, "virtually collocated".},

abstract = {Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48 hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019 Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85% of commits were made within the first month, and approximately 77% of the total commits occurred within the first week. Only 7% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of commits divided by the length of the development period was only 0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to help increase the average longevity of the development period for projects.},

Time-bounded events such as hackathons can provide an opportunity for newcomers to experience programming firsthand in a collaborative environment. Just providing access to computational resources, however, is not sufficient because newcomers will likely require guidance and support in order for them to perceive their participation in a hackathon as a positive experience propelling them to future success in the subject. We have developed a hackathon format for this purpose that we have successfully applied during in-person events for two years. The global pandemic of 2020, however, forced us to move towards a virtual format. In this paper, we report on our experience making this transition. We will specifically elaborate on two online events, discuss successes and failures and provide suggestions for hackathon organizers.},

abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.},

In general a hackathon event involves the collaborative development of software projects in a concentrated time period. Having hosted five hackathons we have developed a body of knowledge through experience, which we hope will encourage other schools to hold their own hackathons. This paper describes the issues related to retention in computing and technology programs, some of the factors and decisions that have to be made in hosting a hackathon, and some of the side benefits that hackathons produce.},

abstract = {This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.},

The study is based on the thematic analysis of ten in-depth interviews with the hackathon organisers. The findings report how trust among the organisers was encapsulated in 1) the shared big goal, 2) the significance of real-life networks, 3) a strong lead organiser on the collaboration forming on the fly, and 4) the lack of face-to-face contact in relation to becoming familiar or staying unknown. Technology related findings showed that the collaboration platforms were selected based on familiarity and ease of use. The chosen communication channels created a split between age groups, and transparency of the communication suffered somewhat from one-to-one communications in the background and divided application use. However, trust between the organisers helped them to overcame the transparency challenges. The findings are applicable to societal crisis situations in which technologies are used to build collaboration in aim to address shared challenges.},

abstract = {Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of collaboration in various domains. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which teams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has thus consequently focused on studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the advantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has led to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that participated in 4 hackathon events across two continents. By analyzing the collected data, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based on individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different strategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams that kept open synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio territories), in a sort of "radical virtual co-location". However, others, such as interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual collaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how technologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this collaboration.},

abstract = {Hackathons and similar innovation contests can accelerate the development of software prototypes to help large corporates such as banks experiment with new technology. These companies may also be adopting Agile in their existing software development practices and it is worth exploring the usage of Agile principles at such events and whether hackathons can assist overall Agile adoption. FNB is one of the largest and most innovative banks in South Africa and runs an internal hackathon called Codefest to enhance IT innovation in product design and internal operations. The event attracts over 200 internal developers who compete in teams during a 48-hour coding marathon. South African banks, including FNB, are also adopting Agile practices to improve speed and quality in their software development lifecycle. Codefest was not intended to help drive FNB's Agile journey, however some of its principles and practices were observed as having naturally occurred during the event.This article explores the emergence of Agile practices at FNB Codefest as observed during publicly broadcast interviews with various participants and stakeholders. The spoken words of the interviewees were analysed for dominant concepts using the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto as a coding framework. The interviews provided practical observations of the environment at Codefest which was found to encourage certain Agile principles and practices. Adoption of Agile by teams also correlated with their level of success in the Codefest competition however more research would be needed to determine whether Codefest accelerated the bank's overall Agile journey.Three main Agile concepts were found to be naturally cultivated by the environment of Codefest; collaboration, motivation and elements of technical excellence. Collaboration was observed between IT teams, between business and IT teams and between business teams, while also creating a model of conditions for how teams could operate during business as usual. Intrinsic motivators such as autonomy, mastery and purpose were also observed at codefest, supporting the notion of knowledge worker motivation as being crucial in setting up successful software development teams. Elements of technical excellence correlated to Agile through methodologies such as Extreme Programming or Scrum while quality practices were enabled by team practices such as communication and planning. Codefest was also mapped to a proposed model of Agile environments while considerations for such contests and suggestions for next steps are also presented. These include (1) using Codefest to raise awareness of Agile, (2) understanding how extrinsic motivators affect Codefest and Agile, (3) using Codefest participants to share and drive technical excellence and (4) Agile training before Codefest.},

abstract = {Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.},

abstract = {Hackathons are increasingly embraced across diverse sectors as a way of democratizing the design of technology. Several attempts have been made to redefine the format and desired end goal of hackathons in recent years thereby warranting closer methodological scrutiny. In this paper, we apply program theory to analyze the processes and effects of 16 hackathon case studies through published research literature. Building upon existing research on hackathons, our work offers a critical perspective examining the methodological validity of hackathons and exemplifies how specific processes for organizing hackathons are modified for different purposes. Our main contribution is a program theory analysis of hackathon formats that provides an exploration and juxtaposition of 16 case studies in terms of causal relations between the input, process and the effects of hackathons. Our cataloguing of examples can serve as an inspirational planning resource for future organizers of hackathons.},

abstract = {Mapathons and hackathons are short-lived events with different purposes. A mapathon is a collaborative effort for collecting geographic data in unmapped areas, while hackathons are focused on application development. Mapathon outputs need to be high quality to be reusable, but often, when applications are later built on top of map data, there is a mismatch between data collected and application requirements. We conducted an international collaboration project aiming to address this situation by creating a circular process where geographic information is collected in a mapathon and later used in a hackathon. Based on user feedback this cycle can be repeated so the collected data and developed applications can be improved. In this event report, we describe the two mapathon-hackathon cycles that were part of our pilot to validate that process. We present their outcomes and some lessons learned. We focused on the so-called "blue economy" (i.e. the sustainable use of marine and ocean resources for economic growth and improved livelihoods in coastal areas.) as the target domain for this pilot. Data for carefully selected areas of the South African coast was collected through in mapathons and later use in hackathons. The mapathons were held in South Africa, and the hackathons took place in Brazil.},

abstract = {College hackathons have become popular in the past decade, with tens of thousands of students now participating each year across hundreds of campuses. Since hackathons are informal learning environments where students learn and practice coding without any faculty supervision, they are an important site for computing education researchers to study as a complement to studying formal classroom learning environments. However, despite their popularity, little is known about why students choose to attend these events, what they gain from attending, and conversely, why others choose *not* to attend. This paper presents a mixed methods study that examines student perceptions of college hackathons by focusing on three main questions: 1.) Why are students motivated to attend hackathons? 2.) What kind of learning environment do these events provide? 3.) What factors discourage students from attending? Through semi-structured interviews with six college hackathon attendees (50% female), direct observation at a hackathon, and 256 survey responses from college students (42% female), we discovered that students were motivated to attend for both social and technical reasons, that the format generated excitement and focus, and that learning occurred incidentally, opportunistically, and from peers. Those who chose not to attend or had negative experiences cited discouraging factors such as physical discomfort, lack of substance, an overly competitive climate, an unwelcoming culture, and fears of not having enough prior experience. We conclude by discussing ideas for making college hackathons more broadly inclusive and welcoming in light of our study's findings.},

abstract = {Time bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention from practitioners and researchers. Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.},

This paper presents an iteration of a participatory design process to create spaces for re-imagining products, services, systems, and policies that support breastfeeding in the United States. Our work contributes to a growing literature around making hackathons more inclusive and accessible, designing participatory processes that center marginalized voices, and incorporating systems- and relationship-based approaches to problem solving. By presenting an honest assessment of the successes and shortcomings of the first iteration of a hackathon, we explain how we re-structured the second "Make the Breast Pump Not Suck" hackathon in service of equity and systems design. Key to our re-imagining of conventional innovation structures is a focus on experience design, where joy and play serve as key strategies to help people and institutions build relationships across lines of difference. We conclude with a discussion of design principles applicable not only to designers of events, but to social movement researchers and HCI scholars trying to address oppression through the design of technologies and socio-technical systems.},

abstract = {Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.},

These initiatives became an attempt to crowdsource the development of software applications targeting government transparency and urban life, under the smart cities umbrella. Some authors have been criticizing the results of these competitions, complaining about the usefulness and quality of the software that is produced. However, academic literature has much anecdotal evidence on that, being scarce on empirical analysis of civic hackathons. Therefore, we intended to gather preliminary data not only to help verifying those claims but also to understand how teams in these competitions are tackling the different activities in their software development process, from requirements to application release and maintenance. In this work, we present preliminary results of these findings.},

abstract = {Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) usually have limited resources that prevent them from investing in software-based innovation. Sometimes hackathons are used as a resource to crowdsource software for NGOs, but often the resulting projects are not usable or not carried on. These events are not seen as a good option in Software Engineering for social good (i.e., software focused on social change) since they are too short to allow an understanding of the social context of the target institution. Taking that limitation into account, after performing 6 months of ethnography to understand the social context of an NGO, by identifying user needs and eliciting requirements, we organized an inclusive hackathon to address two specific challenges identified in that organization. This paper presents an experience report in the context of an interdisciplinary project with researchers from the Psychology, Design, and Computer Science domains, where the goal is to propose and apply an Open Social Innovation process focused on digital innovative solutions in the context of an NGO from Brazil that supports socially vulnerable people living with HIV/AIDS.Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) often lack the resources to invest in software innovation. Hackathons have been used to get software for NGOs, but resulting projects are often not useful or continued. These events are not seen as the best way to make software for social change, since they are too short to understand the context of an NGO. To tackle this limitation, researchers in psychology, design, and computer science worked together for 6 months to understand the needs of an NGO that supports people living with HIV/AIDS. After that, two specific problems were prioritized and a hackathon was conducted to gather solutions proposed for those problems. The goal of the project was to find digital solutions for the NGO through an Open Social Innovation process.},

Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.},

abstract = {This paper investigates how the conceptions of gender in memes are central to socializing at hackathons. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography of seven hackathons, I provide insight into how references to memes and informal technology culture shape interaction in local manifestations of this culture. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, I show how vocabularies and artifacts of technology culture move between on and offline spaces. These findings have implications for HCI research that investigates questions of materiality in computer-mediated communication. Second, I show how even the mundane memes of technology culture can reveal the toxic masculinity and ideology of Incels. By tying these internet memes to a physical context, I unpack how humor can reveal and perpetuate the enduring masculine dominance of technology. I end with recommendations for increasing inclusivity at hackathons, based on how HCI is uniquely positioned to understand how Internet symbols and interactions manifest offline.},

We have pioneered the LabHackathon (LabHack): a novel initiative that adapts the conventional hackathon and draws on insights from the Open Hardware movement and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). LabHacks are fun, educational events that challenge student participants to build frugal and reproducible pieces of laboratory equipment. Completed designs are then made available to others. LabHacks can therefore facilitate the open and sustainable design of laboratory equipment, in situ, in Africa. In this case study we describe the LabHackathon model, discuss its application in a pilot event held in Zimbabwe and outline the opportunities and challenges it presents.},

abstract = {In this paper, we argue for the potential and relevance of modelling novel AI co-creative systems after key aspects which characterises the specific kind of design processes unfolding in hackathons. There has recently been an increased interest into the potentials and challenges of creative collaborations between humans and AI, however, there have not been many practical implementations of co-creative systems. We argue that by designing co-creative systems to support the specific kind of creative design work in hackathons, valuable contributions can be made in the context of an overlooked aspect in interaction design; how to support fast design thinking. The specificity of hackathon participation involves high demands for fast idea generation, decision-making, and prototyping, which ideally ends in a functioning and novel prototype. Specifically, we identify three key characteristics of hackathon participation, and for each characteristic we discuss how they may model Human-AI interaction in the context of co-creative systems for fast design thinking. The contribution of this paper is to provide future research on co-creative systems with inspiration grounded in the parallels between aspects of AI and key characteristics of hackathon participation.},

abstract = {Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising approach to broadening participation in computer science and engineering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perseverance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engagement in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10 weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engagement when participants present their work to others at the end of events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education and broadening participation in computing by outlining several conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young people.},

abstract = {The popularity of hackathons has increased as technology pervades more facets of our lives. Originally designed for programmers, hackathons are now being appropriated by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons, we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these events. We conducted an interview study with 22 stakeholders - participants, representatives of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop. We conclude by reflecting on implications for the CHI community in carrying out philanthropic events styled after hackathons.},

abstract = {Hackathon formats have been praised for their potential for promoting innovative thinking and making in a short time-frame. For this reason, hackathons have also been embraced by many researchers who use hackathons as part of their research in various ways. Through an extensive review of 381 publications published during a 10 year time span, we document the multiple ways in which hackathons are embraced and used by researchers The paper contributes to a better understanding of hackathons as part of research by providing a broad overview as a resource for researchers. We identify three main motivations for using hackathons as part of research: 1) Structuring learning, 2) structuring processes, and 3) enabling participation. For each of the motivations, we identify research with hackathons, and research on hackathons as two main categories. Drawing on several examples from the review we discuss benefits and challenges of using hackathons as part of research.},

Six virtual hackathons were offered since summer 2020, successfully supporting 167 students, among them, 33% Latinas and 7.2% African Americans. Analyses of post-event survey responses, the Apps submitted by project teams, and judging scores and feedback pointed to students' growth in technical and professional skills, computing identity, and self-efficacy. Participants with little to no prior computing experience successfully demonstrated improved coding skills such as using variables, conditional and iterative statements, functions, and data tables. They also developed software engineering skills in teamwork, project management, and effective communication.},

abstract = {Hackathons are events that originated as competitions for programmers but transformed into project-oriented events given in different contexts and with different sets of goals. Despite the wide range of topics and business fields covered by current hackathons, a lot of events lack female participants. The lack of gender diversity is a problem, as diversity is a well-known and significant contributor to idea generation, innovativeness, and the efficiency of making novel development. This article covered the current literature, identifying the reasons why women show low interest in hackathon participation. Among these reasons, there is impostor syndrome caused by gender stereotypes, the difference between male and female experiences, for example in video games, as well as the undeserved bad reputation of hackathons as sleepless events, aimed only for specialists and guru programmers. However, hackathon organizers have found positive experiences of attracting more women to their events by implementing female-inclusive measures. Based on the literature, we have compiled recommendations to be considered and implemented in event organizing strategies, implementation models, and promotional approaches to achieve better gender balance at hackathon events.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.},

This workshop focuses on content and skills included in one of the through-course assessment performance tasks: Create -- Applications from Ideas. In this task, students are expected to collaborate with another student in the development process of writing a program, and because each student will submit her/his own program for AP scoring purposes, students are also expected to be able to continue working on their program individually. To obtain the knowledge and skills students will need to be successful with this performance task, students can consider practicing various possible ways to write programs individually and collaboratively. That said, teachers can support student success with this performance task by considering different ways to teach how to develop programs collaboratively (beyond Pair Programming). In this workshop, participants will experience different collaborative programming techniques to develop a program. This workshop is meant for programmers "from beginners to experts". In addition, participants will reflect on the collaborative process, thereby learning some of the essential knowledge and skills that students will need to obtain in order to successfully complete the Create performance task.},

Additionally, a game design workshop is included in the learning experience to ease the difficulties of beginners when creating games. All in all, the strategy facilitates hands on sessions that extend traditional education, during which chemical engineering content is approached differently than in a conventional class.

This article presents the experience of performing virtual events to foster innovation and raise awareness of the local entrepreneurship culture. The first event was developed under the hackathon format, aiming to encourage the local community to propose technological innovation by developing solutions to assist distance learning in universities and high schools. The other event was a virtual fair presenting local startups to the audience, besides providing online courses related to entrepreneurship and new digital technologies. It is worth noting that those events were organized by a strategic coalition following the triple helix model of innovation, gathering universities, industry, and government. The results achieved through those events reinforce the importance of having an organized local strategic coalition to provide a fast response to social emergencies and provide better adaptation capability to society by creating innovations based on digital entrepreneurship.},

Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.},

abstract = {We describe our experience developing and running a Computer Science Living-Learning Community (LLC) for first-year women at Rutgers University, now in its third year. Each year, around 20 first-year undergraduate women who intend to major in computer science (CS) apply and are selected to participate. LLC participants live in a common residence hall and are provided with an educational, mentoring, and community-building program that supports their progress as students and CS majors. Participants take a "house course," Great Ideas and Insights in Computer Science, as a group, and also take a course on Knowledge and Power: Issues in Women's Leadership. Program activities include study sessions and industry interactions, as well as opportunities to participate in K-12 outreach programs, hackathons, and computing research. To evaluate the program, participants and a similar comparison group are surveyed at the beginning and end of the academic year and a focus group is conducted with program participants. Program participants find the program valuable and would recommend it to others, but both program participants and the comparison group report some lack of confidence in their potential success as computer scientists.},

abstract = {Data was a topic previously reserved for expert computer scientists. However, the general public now uses data and visualizations to form opinions and make decisions that affect their lives, such as their health (e.g.: vaccines) and their political opinions (e.g.: gentrification). Unfortunately, few have access to the formal data literacy training required to analyze this data effectively [9]. Existing approaches to provide informal CS education include hackathons [8, 10], after school programs [1], and online tutorials [5]. However, these learning opportunities are often decontextualized from a learner's daily life and require them to go out of their way to learn. Our research investigates techniques to integrate informal learning opportunities seamlessly into people's everyday lives. Prior research in just-in-time learning shows how heuristics can be used in deterministic settings to provide explanations for code [3] and math equations [4]. However, this is challenging when there is no single correct way to interpret and explain content, such as in visualizations. We present Expert Goggles, a browser extension that automatically detects visualizations that people encounter on the web and provides just-in-time, contextually-relevant training modules to scaffold learning and interpretation.},

abstract = {Game jams are hackathon-like events that allow participants to develop a playable game prototype within a time limit. They foster creativity and the exchange of ideas by letting developers with different skill sets collaborate. Having a high-ranking game is a great bonus to a beginning game developer’s r\'{e}sum\'{e} and their pursuit of a career in the game industry. However, participants often face time constraints set by jam hosts while balancing what aspects of their games should be emphasized to have the highest chance of winning. Similarly, hosts need to understand what to emphasize when organizing online jams so that their jams are more popular, in terms of submission rate. In this paper, we study 1,290 past game jams and their 3,752 submissions on itch.io to understand better what makes popular jams and high-ranking games perceived well by the audience. We find that a quality description has a positive contribution to both a jam’s popularity and a game’s ranking. Additionally, more manpower organizing a jam or developing a game increases a jam’s popularity and a game’s high-ranking likelihood. High-ranking games tend to support Windows or macOS, and belong to the “Puzzle”, “Platformer”, “Interactive Fiction”, or “Action” genres. Also, shorter competitive jams tend to be more popular. Based on our findings, we suggest jam hosts and participants improve the description of their products and consider co-organizing or co-participating in a jam. Furthermore, jam participants should develop multi-platform multi-genre games. Finally, jam hosts should introduce a tighter time limit to increase their jam’s popularity.},

To compensate, many NPOs are using a new form of collaboration, civic data hackathons, to leverage on external volunteers' data expertise. In this paper, we sought to understand how civic data hackathons could generate impactful data analytics for NPOs' data-driven work, and how to support collaborative data analytics during hackathons. We collected various types of data (observations, surveys, and interviews) from two civic data hackathons with 9 NPOs and over 300 data volunteers in a Midwestern city in the U.S. Our results describe the collaboration activities and the types of actionable collaborative analytics outputs generated from these activities. We also identify a unique social group (i.e., client teams), who help with preparing and coordinating the event, perform brokering activities to support the collaborative analytics through the civic data hackathons. This broker role is vital for the success of the collaboration between domain experts and data experts. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on the collaborative work of interdisciplinary hackathons, and to a broader understanding of civic data collaborations.},

abstract = {Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in Feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of "feminist consciousness raising" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just "awareness-raising", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.},

We propose a contrasting model for creating interest in computing, by making coding a spectator sport. We present an experience report on the design and implementation of a coding tournament, including survey results that informed the design of the system along with post-event questionnaire data from participants, exploring their attitudes towards different coding events. We find that coding tournaments can be an effective and engaging alternative to hackathons, and that they can motivate some audience members to pursue more coding activities, and possibly even participate as competitors in future tournaments.},

This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.},

abstract = {Large amounts of data are becoming increasingly available through open data repositories as well as companies and governments collecting data to improve decision making and efficiencies. Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.},

Our work contributes to a growing HCI literature on mental health and wellbeing, as well as understandings of how to imbue appropriate value-sensitivity within the digital design process in these contexts. The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.},

But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceived by the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.},

abstract = {Hackathons are events where their participants face the challenge of working intensively and collaboratively with other people. In these events, the participants have the opportunity to develop functional prototypes and solutions to real problems in a short time period (one to three days). Those kind of events have become increasingly popular and spread to several fields of knowledge. Also, they have been adopted by many organizations over the world. However, there is little scientific data that explains why people have participated in hackathons. In this paper, we report findings from an exploratory study in two hackathons organized by a big IT company. We aim to understand why their participants have voluntarily participated in such events. We identified four sets of motivational factors: technical, social, individual and business motivations. Technical motivations are associated with skill acquisition, while social motivations are related to the interaction between people during the event. Also, individual motivations are associated with a sense of autonomy and enjoyment of work. Finally, business motivations include the opportunity of publicizing work and the possibility of establishing partnerships. Our findings contributes to a broader understanding of the motivations for participating in hackathons, as well as providing recommendations for the organization of such events.},

Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.},

This paper aims to understand how CS undergraduate students develop their professional identity through analyzing students' reflection on their career goals, experiences in CS degree programs, and engagement in professional development. We present findings from qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with CS undergraduate students in the United States. We found that CS undergraduates form their computing professional identity typically between Years 2-3 of their degree programs. We identified several reasons students are committed to a computing profession: intrinsic factors (e.g., interest and perception of ability), and discipline-specific factors (e.g. utility and growth). We also found several factors that shape their professional identity: coursework, informal activities like hackathons, and professional development activities including internships and conferences. These findings suggest that the development of computing professional identity is not limited to students' involvement in the academic degree programs but the engagement they have with the broader computing community.},

abstract = {During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

abstract = {Designing educational games that meet both learning and entertainment objectives is a challenging task. Games that begin by developing specific educational goals and are later wrapped in a game or narrative context risk appearing forced, while those that begin with gaming elements to which educational elements are added may appear superficial.

The jam (the 48hr game making challenge) was part of a wider practice of public program curation. It ran for a decade between 2007 and 2016. The discussion and reflection on the jam over the decade that it ran, leads us to reflect on the nature of game jams as community events which have the potential for creation of communitas.},

Their lingering effects on learning, motivation, and social interaction has been documented over the years. In this paper, we observe the immediate effects game jams have on participant confidence in game making skills, and preparedness, as they change over the course of the jam. We conduct surveys on three different jams held from 2016 to 2019. We collect a total of 107 surveys with 26 full sets (subjects) for the confidence questions and 17 for the preparedness. By surveying participants each day at three different game jams, we observe a consistent trend of positive change in their confidence and preparedness. Our results suggest game jams have an immediate positive influence on participants' confidence and sense of preparedness in making games, and this should be studied further.},

It attracts tens of thousands of participants, called "game jammers" or "jammers", from all around the world developing games at the same weekend to the same theme. The key characteristics of this event can be described on the one hand as social and communal, and on the other hand, as global and international. In this work, we analyze the social connections between the jammers with social network analysis and discuss the potential of social network analysis for this field. Our results indicate that jammers are most likely to work on teams between two and five members and often work together with the same colleagues. Also, while the game jam is a highly international event, jammers barely change their geographical locations. The Global Game Jam location graph is thus barely connected but divided into subgraphs.},

abstract = {Game jams have grown as a democratized game development process, imitating on several days the production of the AAA-industry. However, the current format of the mainstream game jams does not give the possibilities to learn how to work in a big production or to emulate correctly the feeling to be in a big team, because the team size tend to oscillate between a solo team to maximum ten participants. In countries like Switzerland, there is no AAA-industry that employs hundreds of developers at the same time. For those kinds of experience, game developers and game designers have to "export" themselves out of those countries, making it a harder experience to live.In 2015, the two main game developers' linguistic communities of Switzerland tried two different experiments answering this question: "How can we bring together the different talents at disposal to create one game?". The Swiss-French game developers' community answered with an indie game jam with a team of 26 developers, the I3 Game Jam. The Swiss-German game developers' community answered with an academic workshop of three weeks with a pre-defined game concept, the Swiss Mercenaries Workshop.From those two approaches, the authors formalize and theorize what is a Big Team Game Jam and their different key elements compared to standard game jams: Target Group, Hierarchy, Participants Motivation, Ownership, and Duration. This paper explores those two solutions, their community context, and gives a framework for countries like Switzerland without a AAA-industry to emulate those productions at very low-cost.},

abstract = {Open innovation initiatives aimed at building and proposing service improvements for the Government increasingly include activities of programming marathons for Apps (hackathons), ideation and prototype challenges as different ways to stimulate civic engagement. In this scenario is the Global Gov Jam, a 48-hour event that happens simultaneously in several cities around the world, aiming to involve government people together with citizens to propose innovative ideas for solving governmental problems. This work investigates what are the main motivational aspects of factors that lead people to engage in Global Gov Jam and what are the correlations among those factors. The method used was the replication of a survey applied previously to participants of civic hackathon events, with some adaptations motivated by the characteristics of the type of event we studied. The results show that "thinking outside the box", which gives the possibility of producing innovation without the conventional limitations, is the most significant motivational aspect for participating in this event. Evidence points to the similarity of the main motivational factors, among the results found in the original research on hackathons and this work. We also demonstrate through empirical evidence that there is correlation among motivational factors related to social interactions, such as visibility among peers, performing teamwork, and networking.},

As game jam themes can be a major inspiration in evoking design in jams, the role of idea generation toolkits seem diminished. Few game jams provide prizes, because game jams are not competitions, but a compressed, cooperative development environment to learn, experiment, and share results. This makes it an ideal situation to employ idea generation toolkits. We investigated how jammers use these idea generation toolkits, and how might they aid in inspiring evocative ideas. Our survey of idea generation toolkits show that experienced jammers tend to experiment with new ideas, and largely possess intrinsic motivations to participate.},

Also, special actions were taken to increase the percentage of released games and to support teams, formed at the jam, in their future work. Approaches to country-level cooperation and mutual support are described, the role of educational institutions, businesses, non-governmental organizations, mass media and communities in locations organization is compared. For location-level and country-level the logistic and organizational issues are analyzed, ways of work with local game development communities are given and effect of previous game jams to the game development community growth is measured. Introduction of country-level rating and its effect to the participants' attitude to jamming is discussed. Background of other game development events in the country which support or divert attention from Global Game Jam is taken into consideration.},

abstract = {This paper explores the potential of using game jams to engage with game developers in order to address issues related to inclusivity in games. Based on extensive critical analysis of local cooperative games, we have identified a number of issues in relation to how the socio-technical system (software, hardware, cultural norms, etc.) casts female players in restricted roles. These findings were used as input into two game jams where participants were tasked with creating game concepts that would address the inclusivity issues we identified. In this process, we discovered that it is difficult to simultaneously operate on a critical reflective level of analysis at the same time as engaging in concrete creative work. Changing the mix of voices - by inviting designers known for inclusivity advocacy and drastically increasing the number of female participants - allowed us to maintain the intended focus on the underlying issues more effectively in the second workshop. This, however, came at the expense of silencing less advocacy-inclined participants.},

This game was designed for the 2017 Global Game Jam and supports accessibility for the colorblind and deaf. The Big Wave is an information gathering puzzle game which utilizes simultaneously playing audio tracks to hide information being conveyed by various channels on a HAM radio. Various hints throughout the story, which may be directly connected to the story or may just be coincidentally similar, are presented to clue the player into what needs to be done to proceed. This paper describes the design of this game and our process methodology in producing it over the course of under 48 hours. Also covered are our plans if more time was available to have worked on the project.},

abstract = {As game jams become more popular among both game developers and people interested in becoming one, the number of jams that occur each year has grown at an astronomical pace. Given this popularity, it is clear that participants are gaining some intrinsic value from participation. This appears to come in many forms including new friends, business partnerships, portfolio pieces, development practice, skill acquisition, and improved confidence in personal abilities. This research set out specifically to explore the effects of game jam participation on personal self-efficacy related to the skills required to successfully perform at a jam. Game jams tend to be social events and participants are often times less social individuals. Putting participants in the situation of having to communicate their ideas with others and express themselves under the stress of a deadline while the entire team is acquiring new skills sounds like a recipe for disaster, however, this is not the case. A pre and post-event self-efficacy measure was administered at the 2016 Global Game Jam site in Orlando Fl. The results of this research show significant improvements in self-efficacy related to the social skills required to be successful at a game jam. It is possible that the excitement and challenge of developing a game helps facilitate breaking down of social walls and provides an opportunity to practice socialization skills with purpose that is motivating to participants.},

These "superjammers" have had experience on jamming at over 20 game jam events online or with physical locations, such as Global Game Jam and Ludum Dare. The jammers in this study reported how game jams have been important platforms of learning for them: they have not only learned technical skills, but also reported improvements in their workflows and various specific issues. From the initial curiosity towards game jams as a challenge, these jammers have later discovered multiple benefits of the events ranging from general enjoyment of creating games to social factors and keeping up their competences as game developers. In this paper, the notion of "superjammers" as a short for exceptional game jam participants is further explored and the lessons of the study is used for planning the next steps of the research into exceptionality in game jam participation.},

abstract = {Game jams are games enthusiasts' encounters for one obvious goal in common: creating games. But more than that, these meetings work as an important networking environment for building social and professional relationships among individuals in the area, in addition to generating an ecosystem of support favorable to the game development market, benefiting all those involved: aspirants, professionals and the market as a whole. For these reasons, participating in game jams has become a relevant factor for the insertion and consolidation of game professionals in the area. However, it is noticeable that women still represent a very small percentage in these events. This work aims to understand the aspects that may be the reason of the lack of female participation in game development marathons, in order to clarify what are the behaviors and environments that either promote or discourage female motivation to participate in game jams. For this purpose, we conducted a case study where we used a mixed method approach to analyze the influence of gender in different perspectives of a game jam. We found results such as the motivational aspects for both genders were very similar; the self-confidence of female participants was lower than male participants; and the significant increase of female registrations after an advertisement campaign targeting women.},

MDA suggests that the components of a game can be broken down into mechanics, which describe processes and actions available in a game, dynamics, which describe the dynamics of actions reaction to each other in game, and aesthetics, which describe the emotional responses evoked in the player by the game.This paper describes how MDA can be applied in a game jam context in order to focus the design and ideation process, and direct team activities into building a cohesive, playable end result.},

These events bring people together not only to make games in a short period of time but to connect beginners, amateurs and professionals. Although seen as a diverse environment, in Games – either as a technology culture or as a professional occupation – we can find prejudice and discrimination against LGBTQIA+. This paper is an exploratory study about diversity in game jams, specifically about the participation of LGBTQIA+ in some hubs at Global Game Jam 2021. We investigated the participation of LGBTQIA+ people at the Global Game Jam 2021, aiming to understand their perspectives and the potential challenges around any prejudice or discrimination they may face during the game jams. We combined quantitative and qualitative research methods. First, we used a survey to collect quantitative (closed-ended questions) and qualitative (open-ended questions) data. The second part consisted of online interviews with some of the respondents from the survey. After analyzing the collected data, we provided a set of recommendations for structure and organization, aiming at a more inclusive and welcoming environment to LGBTQIA+ participants, besides increasing the participation of this public. The recommendations are: Organize diversity-focused game jams and diversity-focused Global Game Jam hubs; make every participant aware of the code of conduct; foster collaboration over competition; introduce aspects that the LGBTQIA+ community can relate to; and promote learning activities.},

Different leadership strategies tend be adopted depending on variations in jam goals, such as community formation, enabling creativity, or teaching and learning. While the goals of game jam organizers are known, details about how organizers lead and organize their jams are lacking. To understand these leadership strategies, we interviewed seventeen game jam organizers who ran online and physical game jams for student groups, hobbyists, and semi-professional game developers. We found that these organizers valued learning, community, and creativity, and employed leadership strategies such as establishing a vision for jam outcomes, attending to participant emotional needs, and providing mentorship to ensure participants remained engaged during their game jams. We also found a tension between creativity and learning oriented leadership strategies, with some organizers choosing to disengage to remove their influence on event outcomes. We use these findings to reflect upon how to balance game jams for both learning and creativity, and how to design for leaderless jams.},

This study discusses how facilitators might introduce radical game design values in their events, using thematic, technological, and expressive strategies.

The Newsjam event convened a mixture of media professionals and non-gamers to test the hypothesis that game-making tools have become so simple those who have never made a game previously could make a game in a single weekend. The results indicate that while it possible to make simple digital toys, the highest quality contemporary newsgames were made by teams that had previously existing experience in game making. 19 participants, produced 5 games in just over 36 hours. Their expertise ranged from first time game maker to seasoned independent developers.},

abstract = {The Serious ‘Slow’ Game Jam (SSGJ) is a new model for use in serious game design and research. Game jams contribute to creative, innovative and collaborative design, however, game jams for serious purposes require an alternative model that integrates domain experts within the jammer community to ensure the validity of their designs and content. Furthermore, a rigorous yet accessible design methodology is required to balance pedagogic and game aspects to support jammers, as well as to assist researchers in subsequent analysis and evaluation. A standard entertainment game jam model does not afford support for these aspects. The SSGJ model addresses these needs through an inclusive, collaborative, and creative framework for multidisciplinary teams, which includes: encouraging reflection and knowledge exchange; improving content validity; and providing continuous support and mentoring to participants. Reflection on the model highlights the importance of framing serious game jams as explicitly educational activities and embedding them into existing training contexts. The SSGJ model contributes to a collaborative serious game design methodology for the wider research community, irrespective of application domains.},

This includes aspects such as advancing development and project management skills, but also improved effort estimations, first prototypes for portfolios, and strengthening networking and communication skills. Other prospects of such efforts can also be support for and the strengthening of local industry by connecting and training new talents, opening recruiting possibilities, and building a vivid and strong local developers network. In recent years, we have run different types of game prototyping projects in different settings at Graz University of Technology. These have included traditional digital 48-hour game jams, analog jams, development projects running for some months, and projects with an interdisciplinary and international setting. Each format supports different learning goals and has different potentials to bridge industry and academia. In this paper we summarize different benefits of the different formats and compare their potential to support (computer science) students in learning different aspects important for their future career and discuss general aspects related to game jams with potential for strengthening the local industry.},

Online Jam" (henceforth "GNOJ") conducted by Aalto University in Finland during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021-2022. Each GNOJ lasted a week, and jammers utilized various online tools, cloud services, communication platforms, and open-source software. Ninety jammers from Finland, Sweden, South Korea, and Japan participated virtually from their home countries. Through post-survey and observation data, we found that jammers highly valued the cultural learning experience offered by jamming. Notably, they encountered unexpected surprises stemming from the diverse local game development practices and different conceptual and terminological connotations across countries during the jam. But jammers displayed proactive engagement in overcoming such cultural differences, with a heightened motivation to learn other languages, cultures, and local game development practices across the world. These findings highlight the pedagogical benefits that cross-cultural online jams can bring to game education. By fostering cultural awareness and competencies in understanding local nuances in game development and communication styles, such initiatives can help future (and current) game developers to effectively prepare multinational work environments and cooperative workflow with remote teams spanning multiple time zones.},

abstract = {Game jams have been attracting an increasingly diverse audience, with thousands of professionals, students, and hobbyists getting together to build game prototypes every year. However, little is understood about about peoples’ motivations to participate in such events and, most importantly, how their motivations differ according to their type and extent of involvement with game development. Through a large-scale survey with attendees of a global-scale game jam, we found that students, hobbyists, indie and professional developers participate for distinct reasons and favor motivations for participation differently. Indie developers are the ones most influenced by social motivations, while students and hobbyists favor the opportunity to strengthen technical skills more than other groups. Finally, game professionals attend game jams to experience teamwork with people other than their regular teammates. Our findings characterize the aspects that influence the attractiveness of game jams and provide a set of recommendations to organizations willing to engage people in their events.},

abstract = {Many game jam studies have been focusing on the potential of the method and the positive sides of the jamming cultures [6, 24]. As a relatively young academic field, perhaps, the game jam scholarly community has been pushing the awareness of the subject towards wider academic audiences - through concentrating on the promise of the format. While there are many studies for game jams [10, 22], the field is still under-explored. This short paper explores game jams specifically from the perspective of the negative experiences – exposing what can be missing from the more optimistic views of game jams. For the purpose of this paper a small online survey was constructed and altogether 17 responses were collected. Additional depth has been drawn from the author‘s extensive experience on various game jams between 2010 and 2021. This study highlights the prevalence of social issues as a source for negative experiences in game jams, but also reflects on the possibility of wider spectrum of cases.},

abstract = {Game jams bring all kinds of creators together to make games from scratch in a relatively short time, often based on shared design constraints. The most influential game jam, Global Game Jam (GGJ) was established in 2009 as an annual event connecting game makers around the globe with shared theme and time-space. The growth of the GGJ indicates the establishment of game jam era: in ten years GGJ expanded from 1 600 to 47 000 participants and diverse set of other game jams are organized modelling GGJ or its online counterpart, Ludum Dare (LD). Even though many game jams are directed towards hobbyist creators or game development students, also professionals take part on these events. Game companies run their internal game jams for various reasons from experimentation and recreation to recruitment and education. Game jams are so widely spread, that they are destined to impact the game making cultures at large. In this paper, I am proposing that we live in the era of game jams and the generation of game makers that have started their development careers within this era are native to game jams.},

However, there is only little research on creativity in game jam formats. Since game jam organisers have great influence on how creativity can be supported in game jams, we explore creativity from the organisers’ perspective. We report insights from an online survey with responses from 27 game jam organisers from 12 different countries with dissimilar levels of organiser experience. We analyse the organisers’ understanding of creativity based on four key aspects from general creativity research: novelty, risk-taking, combinational creativity and creativity constraints. These key aspects guide a deductive, thematic analysis to explore how game jam organisers not only understand, but indeed try to promote the participants’ creativity. On this basis, we discuss how insights from creativity research may further contribute to inform how organisers can successfully facilitate participants’ creativity in game jams.},

abstract = {In less than a year’s time, March 2022 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the first documented game jam, the Indie Game Jam, which took place in Oakland, California in 2002. Initially, game jams were widely seen as frivolous activities. Since then, they have taken the world by storm. Game jams have not only become part of the day-to-day process of many game developers, but jams are also used for activist purposes, for learning and teaching, as part of the experience economy, for making commercial prototypes that gamers can vote on, and more. Beyond only surveying game jams and the relevant published scientific literature from the last two decades, this paper has several additional contributions. It builds a history of game jams, and proposes two different taxonomies of game jams — a historical and a categorical. In addition, it discusses the definition of game jam and identifies the most active research areas within the game jam community such as the interplay and development with local communities, the study and analysis of game jammers and organisers, and works that bring a critical look on game jams.},

This study presents a description of preliminary findings from the development, implementation, and examination of an after-school pilot project combining neuroscience education and the creation of playable media for underserved high school students in Hayward, California.The program, developed by university faculty, graduate students and the Institute for STEM Education, is an interdisciplinary and collaborative way to combine neuroscience and design thinking. Drawing on two existing university programs, the CSUEB Game Jam and Brain Bee, it offers an after-school program that is engaging, content-rich, and transdisciplinary. Combining neuroscience and design thinking into STEAM, the program also answers a call by California Next Generation Science and Engineering Standards [21] for increased integration of different disciplines in inquiry-based approaches.The evaluation research study of the Brain Jam project was guided by questions of how this after-school program was implemented and the consequences for student engagement. The study also looked at the growth in science literacy and practice as well as design thinking. Preliminary findings appear to support the effectiveness of this transdisciplinary, interactive, and problem-centered approach. They suggest that "folding together" game design and neuroscience was effective in supporting deeper thinking and understanding, and increased student interest in both disciplines.},

abstract = {Competitive elements are a common feature of many game jams. However, there has been little research to date on the impact of competition on participants and their behaviours. To better understand how incentives and competition may affect the motivations and behaviour of game jam participants, we surveyed 47 game jam participants and analysed data from 4,564 online game jams. We found that incentives and competition were neither strong deterrents nor significant motivators for game jam participation. However, a significant percentage of the participants surveyed indicated that incentives and competition would affect their behaviour during a game jam. Our findings suggest this effect is dependent on the nature (or contingency) of the incentive. In addition to its practical implications for game jam organisation, this study highlights a largely untapped potential for further research into the complexities of game jams, incentives and competition.},

abstract = {While games may help to support skills practice and attitudinal change, the game creation process itself may also be effective in enhancing empathy and compassion for other people. Nigeria has over 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages amid its 200 million people. We aim to enhance perspective-taking, empathy, and compassion across different ethnic groups using game jams in public schools in Nigeria. In 2021, we piloted a game jam focused on identity exploration and perspective-taking for students ages 12 to 20. Initial results and next steps are shared.},

abstract = {Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure have become popular in the last few years and are being used in many contexts. In this article we explore the Global Service Jam (GSJ), which has a format similar to other global jamming events such as the Global Game Jam. In this type of event, the activities are centered on service prototyping, encompassing the design process of a service. In this article we perform a mixed-method study to understand the motivation of participants in the local edition of GSJ and compare those motivations to the data we gathered from other cities around the world. We also collected data about the main lessons learned and difficulties found by participants during the GSJ.},

abstract = {This paper presents and evaluates the first international game jam held at Ritsumeikan University, Shiga, Japan, in collaboration with the Rochester Institute of Technology, New York, USA. Game jams are events that bring together people with a common love of games to plan, design, and make original, functional physical or computer games within a set time limit. The number of jams has increased rapidly year after year since their conception, with over 48,000 people participating in the latest version of the Global Game Jam [6]. The RU-RIT game jam had several goals. For the committee the main goals were to introduce the concept of a game jam, and pass on the knowledge of how to successfully plan and execute these events to the host institution, Ritsumeikan University. For the participants the goals were (1) to enjoy a fun and playful way to create games in a low-anxiety, mixed language environment, (2) to give the participants the opportunity to make contacts from around the globe, and (3) to learn new skills both related specifically to making games and other practical skills. This paper will further discusses the importance of group making in international game jam situations and aims to provide the reader with a blueprint describing how to create and administer their own international game jam. The paper will conclude by highlighting some of the issues encountered during the game jam.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a framework to guide the design of educational games during game jams based on Critical Pedagogy, an educational theory grounded on the democratisation of knowledge, critical reflection and collaboration for empowering people to tackle social issues. The process and resources that compose the framework are discussed based on a case study exploring everyday sexism. The framework design has been supported by participatory activities and a trial, suggesting the adequacy of the methods and resources in engaging diverse participants with both the educational game design and the social issue. It is expected that the design process introduced here will boost the potential of game jams as a space for learning, collaboration and critical thinking.},

abstract = {Game jamming is a valuable tool and process to connect game developers from a range of disciplines such as art, programming, audio engineering, or story-telling. The Global Game Jam® (GGJ) thus fundamentally supports the process of connecting people, and forms a basis for studying teamwork formation and -mechanics. It is an annual event, where participants (jammers) meet on physical locations to develop games together within a short time-span of 48 hours. People with similar interest but different skill-sets have the chance to meet and collaborate to create prototypes of games together, whether digital or analog. In this explorative study, data from the GGJ website across four years of game jams and their participants are analyzed, towards investigating group interaction and group forming behavior. The focus is on using social network analysis and social metrics to evaluate the influence of a) jammer skillset and b) jam locations, on social and communicative structures among game jammers in the GGJ environment. The findings suggest that different skill-sets support different forms of social structures and also setups in countries refer to different group sizes and different social structures.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the findings of an interview study of game developers participating to a constrained game development event, Survival Mode 2016 game jam. Survival Mode 2016 was organized in Finnish Lapland as the northernmost jamming site of Global Game Jam (GGJ) 2016. The event differed from the typical Global Game Jam site in Finland in terms of participants being mostly experienced game developers and that there were additional design constraints for their projects. In addition to the global theme, the participants of the Survival Mode 2016 had an extra thematic constraint and the setting of the event itself created such constraints as limited Internet connectivity and power supply. The interviewees reflected on their projects and experiences with design constraints providing interesting insight to the role of design constraints in game development and the difference between a jam setting and commercial game creation projects. These observations can be utilized in further studies of game design constraints as well as in the design of different game jam events.},
