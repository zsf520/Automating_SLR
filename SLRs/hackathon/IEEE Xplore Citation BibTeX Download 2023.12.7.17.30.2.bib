  abstract={The unprecedented situation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic holds seed grains for novel phenomena in the field of innovative learning experiences: Virtual hackathon events might represent a new form of remote co-creation, learning and upskilling. The #WirVsVirus hackathon event in Germany has been initiated by the government to compensate the lockdown-related absence of physical innovation experiences. By analyzing the data set of projects initialized during the hackathon event (n = 1,499), plus the qualitative survey feedback from 956 participants, we found that the learning curve as well as the individual learning outcome for the participates is substantial. Our findings presented in this paper lead to the conclusion that hackathons are a prosperous learning environment, even more out-come oriented than other e-Learning formats.},

  abstract={Globally observed trends in aging indicate that older adults constitute a growing share of the population and an increasing demographic in the modern technologies marketplace. Therefore, it has become important to address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young programmers and older adult participants. In our paper we describe a case study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar events and an improved process of developing apps that target older adults.},

  abstract={According to [8] the student's learning inspiration and adequacy can be influenced by several environmental factors which includes the learning approach and social pressure from class mates. The aim of this study is to investigate students' perceptions about the contribution of collaborative learning and the Hackathon to improve computer programming pass rate. The study included both the undergraduate and post-graduate full-time, Information Technology (IT) students at the Durban University of Technology and a selfadministered survey was used. Social cognitive theory and collaborative learning are the core theoretical frameworks that underpins this study. The outcome of students' perception was analyzed using IBM SPSS. It was found that students that collaborated with others on assignments felt that their computer programming marks would improve when participating in Hackathons. The results from this study also revealed that a high number of students are satisfied with their collaborative learning experience.},

  abstract={The hackathons related systematic literature review findings, from the past 15 years, show that academics mostly focus on giving overview, describing and explaining the events. It also seems to be quite popular to present an overview of event arrangements. The research, which appears to be missing, is the new style of hackathons, which were a requirement for online hackathons and remote events because of the social distancing, e.g., what covid-19 did demand from global society. By core design, hackathons have always been social gatherings and innovation events. Especially in these exceptional times with social distancing requirements, hackathon organizers turned towards online models. As this is not the original way these events have been organized, it was hard to get the best practices to how to proceed as there are few to none general guidelines and models for online/remote hackathons. By studying the current academic literature, our systematic literature review concludes that contemporary academic literature does not give too much guidance either. This review concludes that more practical, on-site, and educational problem-based development research studies about online and remote hackathon events are needed. Especially research on means and tools to utilize to organize them and handle exceptions and be successful in new normal.},

  pages={51-60},
  abstract={In order to remain competitive, software companies need to continuously develop new or advance existing products. In recent years, they have increasingly turned towards organizing hackathons for this purpose. During such events, teams of employees engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. While research on hackathons has been growing steadily in recent years, there is a lack of studies focusing on the continuation of hackathon projects after an event has ended in particular in a corporate context. Our study aims to contribute to existing work in this area by focusing on a corporate hackathon series that was organized by a medium-sized Eastern European software company. Our findings support and extend prior research by indicating that teams consisting of members who aim to improve their skills, that engage in project focused preparation, focus on developing a functioning prototype that is aimed at the current customer base, easy to integrate, and related to existing products during the hackathon, had their projects continued in the case we studied. Moreover, we found indications for organizational commitment in the form of resources to continue a project after an event to predicate project integration. We also identified potential barriers towards this resource allocation related to prioritization and prior commitments of the organizational unit that was projected to continue a hackathon project after the event in the case we studied.},

  abstract={The hackathon phenomenon has just completed twenty years. During this period, it shifted from an event where highly skilled developers searched for bugs or randomly created a software solution to an organised event for exploring a set of technologies, challenges or themes. When promoted by software companies, these events are called corporate hackathons and mainly seek to improve their business activities by getting new ideas, prototypes or even business plans. By involving third parties, corporate hackathons become an open innovation strategy used by companies to ultimately leverage platforms and build a community of users around them, as a mechanism to establish a software ecosystem. This paper results from our motivation to understand how corporate hackathons are organised in IT industry. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study on corporate hackathons, focusing on their process (i.e. steps involved in before, during and after a hackathon) and their main characteristics (goals, participants, duration, location, and application domain). As main contribution, we reveal organisation patterns and provide recommendations for companies aiming to conduct hackathons.},

  abstract={Project Based Learning (PBL) develops student knowledge and skills through solving authentic, engaging and complex challenge in a fixed time span. Academic literature reports its application over a wide variety of disciplines, having both immediate and long-lasting positive effect on team working, project management, and creativity when applying technical skills. We aim to enhance student learning in software engineering. 80% of student respondents up to the date feel that programming assignments that last longer than a week overlap with other subjects enough to draw dedication away. While it unquestionably develops transferable skills, such as time management, it also might not necessarily be good through introductory courses, where students face completely new material. As a result, our aim is to employ “hackathon” - a gathering, where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over 12 to 24 hours – as a teaching tool. While there is a precedent of hackathon being used at University level, it was employed to substitute classic approach via excluding lecturing and lab work completely. Current paper presents research design and relevant discussion on measuring and validating learning outcomes when blending hackathon into traditional programming class as one of the components, not a substitute to other types of classes.},

  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Hackathons and game jams are informal venues to engage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students in practical learning and nurturing interdisciplinary competencies (e.g., programming, design, communication). They also offer rich opportunities for networking and boosting the employability of participants. However, due to the not very inclusive culture created around them, these events may become hostile places for women. The low participation of women in hackathons and game jams may result in a loss of opportunity for them to improve their skills or to find jobs. Little is known about the motivations and perceptions of women participating in hackathons and game jams. We aimed at understanding (1) what are the typical gender-related problems women face in hackathons and game jams and how the perspective of men differ in regards to that problem; (2) how women perceive their motivations and their experience when participating in such events; and (3) what deters some women from participating. In this paper, we surveyed 211 participants of 8 events of this nature targeting higher education students with multidisciplinary backgrounds: 2 game jams (one of them women-focused) and 6 hackathons (one of them women-focused). Additionally, we applied a survey to hear the voice of 47 women who never attended these events to understand their lack of motivation. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we compared the perspectives of men and women who participated in the studied hackathons and game jams. The qualitative data allowed us to investigate different experiences of women who reported discomfort in these events. As contributions of this paper, based on the collected data, we report different perspectives that men and women have about gender issues in these events and highlight the typical sexist behavior (bropriating, mansplaining, etc) of men participating in hackathons and game jams. Results showed that learning is the main motivation for both men and women to join these events. We also map the common reasons for women not being motivated to participate in these types of gatherings. Finally, we propose recommendations so that hackathons and game jams can increase gender equality. Our experience suggests these events, if well planned and executed, may become drivers to change attitudes and stereotypes regarding women in computing. By lowering those barriers, women can be more engaged and stimulated so they can also take advantage of more opportunities for STEAM learning in such informal settings.},

  volume={66},
  number={6},
  pages={654-664},
  abstract={Contribution: This article defines “curricular hackathons” and describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and integrative design problems. Background: Design is an essential part of engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for formative design practice. Research Question: How can the hackathon format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology: The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and implementation. Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some level of integration and/or embedding in a program’s curriculum.},

  abstract={Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the MegaM@Rt2 ECSEL project and discuss in details our approach for fostering collaboration in this project. We choose to use an internal hackathon approach that focuses on technical collaboration between case study owners and tool/method providers. The novelty of the approach is that we organize the technical workshop at our regular project progress meetings as a challenge-based contest involving all partners in the project. Case study partners submit their challenges related to the project goals and their use cases in advance. These challenges are concise enough to be experimented within approximately 4 hours. Teams are then formed to address those challenges. The teams include tool/method providers, case study owners and researchers/developers from other consortium members. On the hackathon day, partners work together to come with results addressing the challenges that are both interesting to encourage collaboration and convincing to continue further deeper investigations. Obtained results demonstrate that the hackathon approach stimulated knowledge exchanges among project partners and triggered new collaborations, notably between tool providers and use case owners.},

  abstract={Hackathons are events that are a sort of application development marathons - lasting between 24 and 48 hours - that became increasingly popular as a method for fast learning and bring people in a short space of time to make creative projects. However, the number of women participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers, designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.},

  abstract={The ACM Computing Curricula 2020 states that the Internet of Things (IoT) is a field in computing that currently lacks an officially endorsed curriculum. This means that it is not yet considered a fully established academic discipline with a widely accepted curriculum that has been recognized or approved by organizations like ACM or IEEE. Given the rapid evolution and interdisciplinary nature of IoT, it can be challenging to determine the most appropriate content to include or exclude in IoT courses. This paper presents an elective course designed to quickly introduce students from Computer Science and Information Systems to the world of IoT. The course focuses on learning application-level communication protocols, the basics of rapid hardware prototyping with Raspberry Pi, and a low-code development tool (Node-RED) to quickly develop IoT applications. For their course project, students worked in teams during a weekend hackathon to build a working prototype of an IoT device with a Raspberry Pi, sensors, and actuators. The hackathon took place in a maker space in the information technology innovation park of the region. The paper provides feedback from 29 students from the two cohorts that took the course, and the qualitative data analysis shows that this approach indeed lowered the barrier to computer science and information systems students having their first contact with IoT development.},

The focus is on key competencies of candidates that are indispensable in today's labor market. The paper will show: what are the expectations of companies that actively seek workers? What are the priority competencies? Is there a scale of expected competencies? We want to find out how participants in the labor market are thinking about cooperation with educational institutions and which concrete ways of cooperation are considered effective in terms of training. What is the relationship between business and institutional education in defining and developing competency requirements? We proceed from the assumption that key skills create the competitive advantage of graduates because they talk about how they use their expertise.

  abstract={Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon. Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from Devpost– a hackathon database – and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before determining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this amount is still significant considering time and member constraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.},

  abstract={Hackathon is a popular event designated to boarder participation and perceptions in computing. With the fast growth of Cyber Security major at Gannon University, an innovative Hackathon event targeting high-school students was designed and deployed through both virtual and on-site forms. The virtual hackathon was developed based on OWASP Juice Shop, which was an open-source insecure web application. Students were expected to deploy and "hack" their own website. Scores were evaluated based on the difficulty of hacking tasks. The virtual event provided the maximal broadcasting of Gannon's Cyber Security. Either global or domestic high-school students got an opportunity to experience the challenges in Cyber Security. The on-site hackathon was a one-day event, with both lecturing and testing. Special topics in Cyber Security were delivered in depth. Students and parents had a chance to "meet the professor". Gannon University is hosting the Cyber Security Hackathon in the second year. The University administrators were impressed with the expansion of marketing impact and increment enrollments.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Hackathons are events that bring together people with diverse backgrounds and expertise in a single location over a limited time to develop disruptive ideas and artifacts. The skyrocketing success of Hackathons across various domains and sectors is due to the opportunities they offer to leverage the creative and Intellectual capacity of the crowd, and to develop new relationships, skills, knowledge, solutions, and processes. However, Hackathons' potential in relation to Intellectual Capital (IC) has been overlooked by the literature so far, and few studies focus on their outcomes and evaluation. This study addresses this issue by conceptualizing Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies whose value proposition includes the (re)generation of IC at the system level. Based on this conceptualization, we leverage the authors' participant observation through active involvement in 57 Hackathons globally with various roles (i.e., participant, mentor, facilitator, jury, and organizer) between 2014-2020. Through iterative qualitative analysis carried out on the literature and empirical material, we identify 32 distinctive critical attributes through which Hackathons may differ from one another. We leverage the literature and the empirical material to highlight how each of these 32 attributes may influence the three key dimensions of IC (i.e., Human, Relational, and Structural). Our analysis offers a framework that can be useful for practitioners when approaching Hackathons and serve as a foundation for design and evaluation instruments, while opening the way for future research on Hackathons as emerging organizational forms specifically devoted to IC (re)generation.},

  abstract={Hackathons are thematic events of short duration that focus on the development of software prototypes. These events normally last from one to three days and they are increasingly popular. However, the interest of women in these events is still low. This paper aims to investigate, from a social-cognitive perspective, how experiences of more inclusive hackathon formats affect interest in hackathons themselves. We adopted autoethnography to systematize the first author's experience as a team participant in a female-focused hackathon. The results suggest that event formats can affect participants’ self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations and goals. These beliefs may influence perceptions of their potential performance on the team, confidence in their own skills in the technology and perceptions of opportunities in the technology market.

  abstract={Contribution: This innovative practice full paper presents a novel approach based on active learning pedagogical strategies and entrepreneurship programmes to teach entrepreneurship to computer science and engineering students. The proposed approach has been tailored for undergraduate classes in order to provide the students with the initial stages of developing a technological startup. Background: Within the computer science and engineering literature, there are some interesting works that deal with entrepreneurial education in different levels and concepts. However, there has not been a paper describing a hands-on approach that makes them experience the important initial stages of a startup. Intended Outcomes: By the end of the course the students will be able to: (1) Validate whether or not their idea can become a business; (2) Build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for their solution; (3) Elaborate a Business Model Canvas (BMC); (4) Present their solution and BMC to potential investors. Application Design: There are some very interesting approaches to teach entrepreneurship in programmes outside of the university, such as the startup weekend, which has created several successful startups. Findings: Before taking this module the majority of the students did not have any contact with any type of entrepreneurship education programme or startup related event such as hackathons. While taking the module, several students attended related events. Some of them got involved with other university entrepreneurship initiates.},

To combat this challenge, companies are using hackathons. A hackathon is a highly engaging, continuous event in which people in small groups produce working software prototypes in a limited amount of time. F-Secure, a software product company, views hackathons as a possible solution to the fundamental business problem of how to make revenue from an idea, spanning the phases from creating the idea to producing a software prototype. However, hackathons pose the challenge of how to transform those promising prototypes into finalized products that create revenue and real business value.},

  abstract={Hackathons bring developers, artists and designers together around a shared challenge: ideate, plan and create an application in a highly constrained time frame. A way to socialize, solve problems, and strengthen soft and hard skills, hackathons have grown tremendously in popularity in the last half decade. Despite this growth, it has been noted that females do not participate in hackathons with the same frequency as males. Some theorize that the hackathon culture is intimidating, does not appeal to women, or that it acts to amplify pre-existing cultural biases in computing. In this paper we introduce an alternative format for hackathons to address these issues. Think Global Hack Local (TGHL) is a non-competitive, community-based hackathon that connects non-profit organizations with student developers. Students donate a weekend to solve problems that these organizations otherwise lack the resources to solve. To date, there have been two TGHL hackathons, and we have observed many interesting divergences within the culture of TGHL in comparison to other hackathons. Response has been positive, and nearly all of them indicate that they would do it again. By adopting some of these ideas, we believe that hackathons can become an environment that is more inclusive and fun for all.},

  abstract={This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a “hackathon,” to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students’ motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon event and a model for 21st century learning can be effective in motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and wearables.},

  abstract={In this innovative practice full paper we present a methodology for organizing a hackathon as a learning instrument within the scope of an undergraduate course. Hackathons are short events (1 to 3 days), where participants motivated by a common challenge gather into groups to build a software or hardware prototype. Studies show that learning is one of the main motivators of hackathon participants. Researchers are also pointing out the importance of hackathons as an informal learning approach for college students. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. This motivated us to bring that practice to the classroom, by offering an undergraduate course where students develop their semester project within a hackathon. In an attempt to systematize the steps, compress and optimize the time allocated for the ideation phase of hackathon projects, we propose a methodology for hackathons in an educational setting. The approach combines concepts from Challenge-based Learning and Design Thinking in a sequence of activities that streamlines the ideation process with regular deliveries in short time frames. This results in objective discussions and quick decision taking, fastly arriving at a project idea where students apply what they learned over the semester. We applied our approach in an Internet of Things undergraduate course within the scope of a semester project developed in an authentic 24-hour hackathon that took place in a maker space. This article details the methodology and presents a mixed methods study to analyze the students' perception on using this set of practices and techniques.},

Working closely with a partner NGO, we provided students with ideas, a sample database, programming tutorials and design feedback. Our hackathon was very successful, resulting in high-quality work and student engagement. In addition to reporting on lessons learned, we will also discuss the top two projects. One was Homeless Helpline, an automated voice system that allows homeless clients to call in and receive information about the services available to them in their area. This project ties into our partner NGO's existing database to automatically extract the information needed for the user, allowing anyone with access to a phone - even a payphone or a feature cell phone - to get access to this information, with very little cost to the NGO. The other project we discuss takes a different approach, making the same information available as a smartphone app, allowing the user to get more precise information about the services closest to their current location, alongside directions, etc. The hackathon was successful enough that we intend to make it an annual event. The paper will also discuss our thoughts on how to host your own successful socially-motivated hackathon for undergraduates.},

Some authors have been criticizing the results of these competitions, complaining about the usefulness and quality of the software that is produced. However, academic literature has much anecdotal evidence on that, being scarce on empirical analysis of civic hackathons. Therefore, we intended to gather preliminary data not only to help verifying those claims but also to understand how teams in these competitions are tackling the different activities in their software development process, from requirements to application release and maintenance. In this work, we present preliminary results of these findings.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Governments, universities and companies around the world are seeking ways to promote innovation in order to build solutions towards Smarter Cities. As smart cities grow, living labs are created as platforms to test these solutions in a real-life context before implementing them on cities. Hosting smart cities' themed hackathons is an excellent way for empowering and engaging citizens to be aware of how their active participation can positively affect the quality of life in their cities. Hence, a synergy between living labs and smart cities' hackathons has been proven successful, more specifically in the city of Guadalajara, Mexico, where a series of biannual smart cities' hackathons has been hosted with concrete results. These hackathons work as a platform that encourages the whole ecosystem which involves government, education, industry and citizens to focus on solving punctual problems in order to achieve a smarter city. The solutions and contributions for smarter cities generated at these events can be in the form of applications, creation of datasets, APIs, hardware, wearables and sensors; which are tangible footprints that can be used for posterior research oriented towards the optimization of the city's processes and services. To maximize the potential of these events, they must follow specific organization guidelines; therefore, a model describing the steps for hackathons to become an enabler platform of innovation in a city's ecosystem is proposed.

  abstract={This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and communication of information across traditional engineering and operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured around the technical functions within an engineering company has the capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80% reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with using current/regular internal methods.},

  abstract={Given the current scientific questions of societal significance, such as those related to climate change, there is an urgent need to equip the scientific community with the means to effectively use high-performance and distributed computing (HPDC), Big Data, and tools necessary for reproducible science. The Polar Computing RCN project (http://polar-computing.org) is a National Science Foundation funded Research Coordination Network, which has been tasked with bridging the current gap between the polar science and HPDC communities. In this paper we discuss the effectiveness of “hackathons” as a model for implementing both the pedagogical training and the handson experience required for HPDC fluency. We find hackathons effective in: (i) Conveying to a science user how and why HPDC resources might be of value to their work, (ii) Providing a venue for cross discipline vocabulary exchange between domain science and HPDC experts, (iii) Equipping science users with customized training that focuses on the practical use of HPDC for their applications, (iv) Providing hands-on training with a realistic domain-specific application in a community of one’s peers, but are (v) an incomplete training model that requires supplementation via domain science specific HPDC training materials. In addition to their pedagogical benefits, hackathons provide additional benefits in terms of team building, networking, and the creation of immediately usable products that can speed workflows both for those involved in the hackathon as well as others not involved in the hackathon itself.},

  abstract={On October 16th, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan, from 8:00 to 18:00, the first Intelligent Transportation Systems plus Data Mining challenge was organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving problem: Lane Departure detection. This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting, but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to expect outstanding results ? the best one was only slightly over 3% above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking into consideration for example computer power load of the different algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of view.},

  abstract={Hackathons are time-bounded crowdsourcing events, which have recently prospered in many technology and science domains across the globe. We study Europe’s largest hackathon, Junction, to better understand the distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of this type of hackathon as a form of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Moreover, we determined how they add value to attending companies and participants. In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed. Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection, strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential, and pervasive information technology. Based on our findings, we argue that these properties and mechanisms increase the possibility of finding innovative solutions to companies’ problems in Junction-like mega hackathons. This article concludes with managerial implications for companies to consciously plan and prepare while knowing what to expect during the hackathon.},

  pages={68-79},
  abstract={Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon. Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused, and what factors affect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from Devpost- a hackathon database - and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before determining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this amount is still significant considering time and member constraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects. The number of associated technologies and the number of participants in a project increase reuse probability. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.},

  year={2022},
  volume={65},
  number={4},
  pages={638-646},
  abstract={Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.},

  abstract={Governments, universities, and companies around the world are seeking ways to promote innovation to build solutions towards Smarter Cities. From IBM experience is key to have a Smart city the following three factors implemented: they instrument (sensors installed in the city to capture data), then must be interconnected (send gathered information from sensors to some place) and finally enable technologically to produce new levels of intelligence. As smart cities grow, living labs are created as platforms to test these solutions in a real-life context before implementing them on cities. Hosting smart cities' themed hackathons is an excellent way for empowering and engaging citizens to be aware of how their active participation can positively affect the quality of life in their cities. Nowadays, there are multiple hackathons across the globe, typically the outcome of those hackathons are not being implemented in the urban places because a lack of a place to test "prototypes" in a controlled environment, here is where Living Labs play a significant role in the development of smart cities solutions. T o create high-quality deliverables, a well-controlled Living Lab is needed, also the follow up of all the ideas generated is a key factor. In this work, a method and “model” to successfully implement solutions in smart cities designed in a Hackathon, Semesterathon or Summerathons described, including usage of Agile and Design Thinking methodologies. Also, a model that integrate the smart cities ecosystem and leading edge technologies (i.e. Using Cognitive API's via IBM Bluemix “Platform As A Service”), under this new Era of Cognitive Computing explained. In in this work, we defined and outlined the key performance indicators (i.e. KPI), that will allow improvement in the success rate of the solutions that will be developed and deploy initially at CUCEA Living Lab and finally deployed at smart cities.},

  abstract={Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.},

  abstract={Hackathons are events that originated as competitions for programmers but transformed into project-oriented events given in different contexts and with different sets of goals. Despite the wide range of topics and business fields covered by current hackathons, a lot of events lack female participants. The lack of gender diversity is a problem, as diversity is a well-known and significant contributor to idea generation, innovativeness, and the efficiency of making novel development. This article covered the current literature, identifying the reasons why women show low interest in hackathon participation. Among these reasons, there is impostor syndrome caused by gender stereotypes, the difference between male and female experiences, for example in video games, as well as the undeserved bad reputation of hackathons as sleepless events, aimed only for specialists and guru programmers. However, hackathon organizers have found positive experiences of attracting more women to their events by implementing female-inclusive measures. Based on the literature, we have compiled recommendations to be considered and implemented in event organizing strategies, implementation models, and promotional approaches to achieve better gender balance at hackathon events.

  abstract={Organizations are continuously looking for ways to transform by adopting new practices and technologies in order to become more competitive. They target business growth by increasing their efficiencies, by improving their internal operations and/or delivering novel value-added products and services. This is not easy to accomplish, as it requires defining a new strategy, changing the way of working, training and engaging employees and interacting with the customers to address different global trends.One major challenge companies are facing is how to shift to collaboratively designing new services enabled by digital technologies, integrating talent from an ecosystem of experts. To design new services, organizations can start by reflecting on how they currently execute their innovation process. This latter is all about transforming ideas, data and knowledge into products or services launched successfully to the market. To accelerate their performance, organizations have been changing their practices, from working exclusively in-house to openly collaborating with external talent. Crowdsourcing refers to the necessary activities to collect “out-of-the-box” ideas in order to benefit from the collective brainpower of diverse entrepreneurial individuals and/or their own employees. A Hackathon could be defined as a crowd-sourcing contest, in which a diverse talented crowd is asked to solve a business challenge within 1 to 2 days and only the winners receive compensation or an award. Although hackathons originally focused on coding, lately organizations have been increasingly organizing them to solve business challenges while applying customer-centric approaches such as Design Thinking. This paper provides the foundations to link these approaches and provide insights about a hackathon that enabled innovation experts from different organizations to provide their ideas and identify key services to be delivered by an innovation hub.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 crisis brought about an unprecedented wave of interest into rapid ideation and innovation. Among others, the pandemic triggered a series of collaborative innovation events&#x2014;so-called hackathons&#x2014;to leverage the power of the crowd for crisis response. In contrast to earlier hackathons, these events are different in their speed of mobilization, global scale, and their fully virtual nature with organizers and teams being geographically dispersed. Analyzing this new empirical phenomenon, we characterize COVID-19 hackathons against other forms of innovation crowdsourcing and describe challenges and best practices in the areas of people management, session management, technology, and knowledge management. Based on our empirical findings, we develop a conceptual framework that emphasizes the importance of managing virtual crisis hackathons as the integrated sum of its different parts. Empirical evidence is presented to demonstrate how open innovation efforts such as hackathons can be leveraged for crisis management and more generally for ideation activities in increasingly remote working environments. This article contributes to crowdsourcing research by highlighting key differences of virtual hackathons from the traditional crowdsourcing approaches and hackathons investigated by prior research. Moreover, we affirm the value of mobilizing knowledge from different sources, particularly from a broad spectrum of civil society.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of hackathons in Software Engineering Education. Hackathons have become a growing part of Software Engineering (SE) education in the past decade. Although the academic environment develops technical foundations, a hackathon can develop key competencies to hone lifelong learning. Improving interpersonal, entrepreneurial, and technical skills better prepare SE students for a career after graduation and reinforces engineering-relevant skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and management. This study examines students’ abilities to transfer relevant course skills into the hackathon environment, specifically those related to SE best practices such as software design, SOLID principles (Single-responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion Principle), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Furthermore, through faculty-led hackathon prep sessions and workshops, students are trained to follow an adapted design-thinking process known as the Hackathon Design Thinking Process (HDTP). This study directly addresses the following sub-questions: to what extent do participants feel that hackathons have a positive impact on their SE education, what are the participants’ perceptions of SOLID principles and OOP skill development during the hackathon, and how effectively are participants able to apple SOLID principles and OOP practices during the hackathon? The data is aggregated from a second-year SE undergraduate and a first-year SE masters cohort from participant perception surveys, judges, and project submissions from two hackathons. We utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Google’s Sentiment Analysis, conduct Kendall’s Tau-b Test using IBM’s SPSS Statistics Tool, and compare Class Diagrams with student-submitted code. Results confirm that participants believe hackathons positively impact their education and tend to sacrifice planning time to implement solutions, often disobeying SE design principles and best practices due to the fast-paced nature of hackathons.},

  abstract={Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) usually have limited resources that prevent them from investing in software-based innovation. Sometimes hackathons are used as a resource to crowdsource software for NGOs, but often the resulting projects are not usable or not carried on. These events are not seen as a good option in Software Engineering for social good (i.e., software focused on social change) since they are too short to allow an understanding of the social context of the target institution. Taking that limitation into account, after performing 6 months of ethnography to understand the social context of an NGO, by identifying user needs and eliciting requirements, we organized an inclusive hackathon to address two specific challenges identified in that organization. This paper presents an experience report in the context of an interdisciplinary project with researchers from the Psychology, Design, and Computer Science domains, where the goal is to propose and apply an Open Social Innovation process focused on digital innovative solutions in the context of an NGO from Brazil that supports socially vulnerable people living with HIV/AIDS.},

  abstract={Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.},

  abstract={Crowdsourcing has attracted increasing attention as an open innovation tool that enables firms to access the ideas and solutions of external crowds of participants. Among various crowdsourcing formats, hackathons have emerged as a form of collaborative crowdsourcing that emphasizes team-based collaboration among participants to co-create solutions to firms’ challenges under intense time pressures. Despite their increasing popularity, limited focus has been placed on understanding how hackathons should be organized and managed and the challenges that these time-intense collaborative events generate for both firms and participants. Based on a qualitative, multiple case study of six on-site hackathons, we identify and discuss four key design practices that shape these collaborative crowdsourcing forms, namely 1) problem formulation; 2) participant attraction and team composition; 3) developing the evaluation system; and 4) facilitating idea development. We show that these design practices are interrelated, with decisions about one design practice having important implications for the others, and discuss key challenges that arise from their combination. Overall, our findings highlight how organizing and managing hackathons is a complex matter that requires firms to adopt a more holistic and complementary approach. Implications for innovation management research and practice are discussed.},

  abstract={Hackathons can be defined as platforms for fostering the innovation of small, focused teams who come together to collaborate in solving a particular problem built through a new or existing technology. A community-based hackathon for problem identification was explored in a bid to advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) on ending poverty, attaining equitable quality education and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth as articulated in, “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” by the United Nations continue to be inspire impactful research on how to attain these by the target year 2030. The aim of the study was to identify the problems faced by local communities; craft proposed solutions to create a knowledge base which could be used as input for the capstone projects in the year 2023 at university X. This study used focus groups within the hackathons to gather data from three communities in the KZN, GP and WC provinces of South Africa as part of its effort to understand the application domain and associated requirements. In the paper we present the results of the hackathons. The study found that the attaining of sustainability in communities through poverty eradication and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth can only be achieved if communities sit at the centre of initiatives that seek to improve the lives of ordinary community members. Secondly the study showed the important role communities can play in their development and the power of collaboration between the local community and the universities in solving societal problems. The study also displayed the clear benefits of communities of practice and presents a foundation to sustainable development projects in the community. The study also found that communities are not short of brilliance and with some assistance they can identify and classify their problems as well as develop paper prototypes in a bid to solve the identified problems. The researchers conclude that future collaboration between the local communities and universities could be a game changer for the inclusion of real-life challenges for an authentic student learning experience.},

  abstract={We introduce LYSTO, the Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon, which was held in conjunction with the MICCAI 2019 Conference in Shenzhen (China). The competition required participants to automatically assess the number of lymphocytes, in particular T-cells, in images of colon, breast, and prostate cancer stained with CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Differently from other challenges setup in medical image analysis, LYSTO participants were solely given a few hours to address this problem. In this paper, we describe the goal and the multi-phase organization of the hackathon; we describe the proposed methods and the on-site results. Additionally, we present post-competition results where we show how the presented methods perform on an independent set of lung cancer slides, which was not part of the initial competition, as well as a comparison on lymphocyte assessment between presented methods and a panel of pathologists. We show that some of the participants were capable to achieve pathologist-level performance at lymphocyte assessment. After the hackathon, LYSTO was left as a lightweight plug-and-play benchmark dataset on grand-challenge website, together with an automatic evaluation platform. LYSTO has supported a number of research in lymphocyte assessment in oncology. LYSTO will be a long-lasting educational challenge for deep learning and digital pathology, it is available at https://lysto.grand-challenge.org/.},

  abstract={Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women’s interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon’s gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches. CCS CONCEPTS • Social and professional topics → User characteristics → Gender • Applied computing Education},

To develop a set of skills such as interdisciplinary teamwork, design thinking and time management skills, it is important to create a unique learning environment and this appropriate content must be integrated into the engineering curriculum. The relationship between the acquisition of core knowledge, the implementation of this knowledge and the execution in the project must be sought. Hackathon-like workshops appear to be a good way to establish an initial connection between the knowledge acquired and the application, while developing the skills set necessary for success in collaborative work. The paper presents a way to implement such an interdisciplinary approach, which was tested at Shenkar College, in Israel.},

  abstract={This paper presents an academic educational case of the ‘Jam week’ at Shenkar College of Engineering Design and Art. During the 2021 Jam week – a four days’ hackathon-like course – 700 students working in teams addressed challenges related to loneliness, as defined by five social care organizations. The event was virtually held through an online collaborative whiteboard platform (Miro) and Zoom meetings. The design thinking (DT) methodology was followed, involving multidisciplinary teams of engineering and design students, who collaboratively proposed solutions presented with conceptual videos and posters. Each social organization was allocated with several teams that addressed its challenges, considered in our context as a micro-crowd (MC). We performed a study for examining the influence of the collaborative environment on the MCs’ requirements engineering (RE) activities, and specifically how the structured online boards facilitate the DT process. Following a qualitative analysis of the shared boards, our findings indicate the ways in which the shared collaborative tool and the multidisciplinary nature of the MCs contributed to the high-quality outcomes developed by the teams. We further propose the concept of parallel MC-based RE referring to teams of multidisciplinary developers working in parallel for developing many ideas in a timely and creative manner.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Our societies require talented engineers, who are trained in different engineering fields. Simultaneously these students should have the ability to collaborate and work with people of different disciplines and be able to look for innovation. Engineering programs have been developing different approaches to enhance these required skills, for example through capstones and hackathons. Capstones projects, which are often several months long, aim to prepare students for the transition from school to work. Frequently, these projects are designed to serve companies or startups. Hackathon events are intense and short sessions where students solve a challenge in short periods of time, often between 24 to 36 hours. However, it is needed an approach that exposes students, of different disciplines, to a wider number of industries with a more collaborative approach. We need interventions in which students can experience how their knowledge contributes to the innovation and visions of different stakeholders. Furthermore, these learning interventions, where we promote a collaborative experience among the participants where everybody learns from everybody, should require less time than with capstones or hackathons. The University of Turku developed the Industrial Seminar on Future Technologies course for master and phd advanced students, where we address: multidisciplinarity, collaboration, connection with engineering industry and innovation. Students in this course are exposed to challenges and visions of different companies in diverse domains, e.g. biotechnology, metal industry, maritime. Each seminar session focuses on one company, and we work together to address the session's aim in at most four hours. For each session participants have a pre-assignment, which is aligned to the objective of the session, and a post-assignment that focuses on the session's reflection. An important aspect to make each session successful is the preparation of the session with the local company. Hence this course addresses different objectives: (i) Expose students to industry, (ii) Students gain awareness of how their knowledge is relevant for different industry challenges and visions, (iii) Collaboration between session participants (from different backgrounds and from the guest company), (iv) Possibility to innovate (“think out of the box”), (v) University of Turku builds bridges with the local industry, as together with each guest company we go through a process of “sharpening” the company's challenge or vision for this particular seminar session. In this paper we analyze this course with its outcomes, utilizing the final results of each session, and the feedback from students and industry representatives.},

  abstract={Education is changing rapidly towards digital and online forms in universities. E.g. digitalization and Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)s evolve remote education tools, which changes the teaching approaches. Covid-19 accelerated digital transition from classroom-based education towards hybrid models, then online classes and finally to fully online education. While the education has moved from classrooms to Internet environment, the suitability of this transition has not really been evaluated. This is especially important to teamwork based courses in which the collaboration within teams and between teams is considered a major part of the learning outcomes of the course. Our study presents experiences on transforming a set of software engineering courses from a fully onsite course to a fully online course and lessons we have learned on that transition. We analyze hackathon and capstone style courses for traditional and remote execution modes. We have used hackathons for decades and have experience of different types of implementations. For capstones we have two different courses that we have experience with. Analyzing the team-based courses shows focal points which area hard to solve with online approaches. Online environment does not only make students faceless to the teacher but also to other teammates. This is especially visible in the long-lasting capstone courses.},

  abstract={Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats; consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance; 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance; and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities.},

In this research work, an analytical study has been carried out by considering the data set that remains open to the public by illustrating the available housing properties in machine hackathon platform. The data set has nine features. In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XG Boost). Such models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on the predictive errors obtained between these models.

For instance, novices might participate on collaborative development sessions in order to learn new development practices, tools, and techniques used in a software development project. Besides these potential benefits, little is known about the perception of students engaged in collaborative development efforts. Therefore, in this paper we investigate whether or not the engagement of students in collaborative development efforts contributes to the learning process of software development practices and techniques, as well as the perceived benefits and challenges related to collaborative software development activities. To this end, we first performed several of coding dojo sessions during a period of 18 months. These development sessions have been conducted within the context of a real software modernization effort, which aims to modernize two enterprise systems of the Brazilian Army. After that, we carried out a qualitative study where the participants (students, software developers, and software architects) answered a survey, in order to understand the learning benefits of using coding dojo in software development activities. The results so far are encouraging. Coding Dojos allowed professors and software architects to seamless share their experience in software development with the students. According to the answers, the methodology created a better environment for the team, allowing better discussions and ideas to be shared and implemented. This has helped the team members to solve problems easier than by themselves, bringing additional benefits, such as steep the learning curve in programming languages, usage of development tools, understanding the requirements, and code refactoring.},

  abstract={The Industry 4.0 (I4.0) advent is re-shaping the way systems and processes operate by considering Cyber- Physical Systems combined with a plethora of emergent Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Intelligent Robotics. However, the emergence of such disruptive technologies strongly establishes a demand for upskilling and requalification of active professionals and young undergraduate students. This means that the wide adoption of the 14.0 systems and related tech-nologies is dependent on the efficient implementation of lifelong learning and training initiatives that address these challenges. Having this in mind, this paper describes the implementation of a series of short learning modules and hackathons that relies on a strong hands-on practical experimentation, regarding the upskilling in emergent ICT technologies, particularly focusing on IoT, mobile robotics and Multi-agent Systems. The preliminary efforts contributed to qualify undergraduate students and active professionals in disruptive ICT, with the attendees' feedback illustrating the importance of these kind of short and hands-on learning modules to address towards the continuous demands associated to the diaital transformation.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents development of individual learning paths system in engineering education using the example of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). A set of technological approaches, called Industry 4.0, appeared about 10 years ago. The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future. The system of engineering education is based on the principles of individualization of educational and professional paths, practical orientation, development of soft skills, mobility. Personal education path - it's not just a student's choice, but it's very labor-intensive, properly designed work of educational institution, where not only the whole university is engaged, but also its partner employers.The Moscow Aviation Institute is implementing the integrated concept of "personalization". The peculiarity of individual learning path at the university is that at the first stage of its formation the potential direction and place of professional activity are determined, the necessary competencies to be acquired are accounted, and an individual development plan is formed. The holders of the typical student paths at Moscow Aviation Institute are the internal employer-divisions - Competency Centers, which have become the integrators of forward-looking technologies and are conducting a large number of projects commissioned by the industry. Also, the MAI Competence Centers help students to form the path to the professions in demand in the future, providing an opportunity for practice and mastering additional engineering, technological and managerial competences.Students comprehend their personal learning pathways at three levels. First at the level of the educational program through the identification of elective courses and places of practice after consultation with the tutor. Second, at the academic level, they master the chapters and topics that are the most relevant to student's current or future professional activity. Finally, a committed student can use internships, hackathons, Academic exchange and many other ways to form a unique path, outside the formal learning process.At the same time, an important task is the formation of healthy competition between students in obtaining access to certain modules of individual path.},

  abstract={This paper gives an overview of the software engineering activities of Siemens Healthineers that are related to education and learning. Our training activities have a long history and are done globally throughout the company. We expect that experience and lessons learned are useful for others. Our software engineering education activities range from onboarding of new employees to approaches for continuous learning for highly experienced professionals. We start already very early with training the “next generation” software engineers and focus on growing that talent throughout their career. We share here lessons learned that we have made over the past decades on this topic. This industrial experience report describes our approach by focusing on various “dimensions”. The dimensions include the experience level, the content, and the format. Especially due to the Corona situation, we have held many trainings virtually and we share also our insights. Finally, we include three concrete examples of an aspect of our education and learning activities. These are on applying and conveying the agile mindset to learning to attract young talents, virtual hackathons and systematic link between training and job profiles.},
