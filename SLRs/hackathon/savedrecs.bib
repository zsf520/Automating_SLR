Abstract = {Hackathon as a social event has been identified as a method that assists
   participants collaborate and solve technical design challenges in a
   limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance
   in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for
   teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for
   some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited
   to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to
   investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the
   academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research
   was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South
   African IT programming students. The results indicate that relative
   advantage (beta = 0.142, rho = 0.045), perceived usefulness (beta =
   0.205, rho = 0.036), performance expectancy (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.002)
   and self-efficacy (beta = 0.330, rho = 0.000) have a positive influence
   on the behavioural intention of students to adopt hackathon for learning
   IT programming. The hackathon adoption model was developed for higher
   education. This research helps in the adoption of hackathons in higher
   education.},

Abstract = {This article offers a description and critical evaluation of a novel
   method for inquiry-based learning (IBL) directed at undergraduate
   students: a Global Health Hackathon. The hackathon was piloted as part
   of an Introduction to Global Health' undergraduate course in order to
   enable students to gain and create knowledge about specific global
   health-related challenges and, simultaneously, to acquire tangible and
   transferable skills. We provide a critical evaluation of our practice by
   drawing on relevant academic literature concerned with IBL, course
   material to describe the hackathon and its related components and
   outputs, and student evaluations to reflect on the overall module
   experience. We conclude by sharing reflections and recommendations of
   necessary measures required to institutionalize IBL in a more
   sustainable manner in higher education institutions.},

Title = {One-off events? An empirical study of hackathon code creation and reuse},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {7},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Context Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate
   on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research
   focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the
   evolution of the hackathon code. Objective We aim to understand the
   evolution of code used in and created during hackathon events, with a
   particular focus on the code blobs, specifically, how frequently
   hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much new code they develop,
   if that code gets reused afterwards, and what factors affect reuse.
   Method We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from
   Devpost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project
   characteristics, original author, code creation time, language, and size
   information from World of Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by
   identifying all commits containing blobs created during hackathons and
   identifying all projects that contain those commits. We also conducted a
   series of surveys in order to gain a deeper understanding of hackathon
   code evolution that we sent out to hackathon participants whose code was
   reused, whose code was not reused, and developers who reused some
   hackathon code. Result 9.14\% of the code blobs in hackathon
   repositories and 8\% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during
   hackathons and around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other
   projects by both blob count and LOC. The number of associated
   technologies and the number of participants in hackathons increase reuse
   probability. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrates hackathons
   are not always ``one-off{''} events as the common knowledge dictates and
   it can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.},

Abstract = {A Health Hackathon provides an opportunity for healthcare professionals
   to collaborate with IT developers and designers to solve health issues
   using technology and thus serves as a potential venue for
   interprofessional education. The present paper reports the views and
   experiences of participants on how the KKU mHealth Hackathon 2017 served
   as a venue for interprofessional education. A phenomenological approach
   was used involving semi-structured in-depth interviews of three faculty
   members and three students who participated in the hackathon.
   Participants expressed their learning experiences during the event, as
   well as factors that promoted or hindered learning. Our findings suggest
   that a health hackathon can serve as a suitable venue for
   interprofessional education as interviewees reported how they had learnt
   to successfully collaborate in interprofessional teams, move beyond
   their prior views and appreciate complementary work from other
   professions, focus on solving problems practically, and create a
   collegial, collaborative atmosphere. There were also some potential
   downsides of the hackathon that could be solved with an improved design
   in future occasions. A Health Hackathon can be an important opportunity
   for interprofessional education. Further studies should focus on methods
   to reproduce these positive learning experiences, mitigate the negative
   aspects, and investigate their long-term effects.},

Abstract = {Collaborative design is the use of design practices which tend to favor
   the integration of different experts, and to support creativity and
   innovation. Therefore, in this study, we were particularly interested in
   the collaborative design tools used in the specific context of a
   pedagogical hackathon. During this event, 1310 engineering students
   mentored by professors and industrial experts worked on around 131
   industrial projects. In this article, we will present our study of the
   tools put in place by the participants of these innovative projects
   according to their training. Our study is based on a collection of
   project data. We will show that storyboards are often used in projects
   that tend toward radical innovation. Moreover, these tools are used by
   groups who have not received specific training on using storyboards.},

Abstract = {In silico approaches have acquired atoweringrole in pharmaceutical
   research and development, allowing laboratoriesall around the world to
   design, create, and optimize novel molecularentities with unprecedented
   efficiency. From a toxicological perspective,computational methods have
   guided the choices of medicinal chemiststoward compounds displaying
   improved safety profiles. Even if therecent advances in the field are
   significant, many challenges remainactive in the on-target and
   off-target prediction fields. Machinelearning methods have shown their
   ability to identify molecules withsafety concerns. However, they
   strongly depend on the abundance anddiversity of data used for their
   training. Sharing such informationamong pharmaceutical companies remains
   extremely limited due to confidentialityreasons, but in this scenario, a
   recent concept named ``federatedlearning{''} can help overcome such
   concerns. Within this framework,it is possible for companies to
   contribute to the training of commonmachine learning algorithms, using,
   but not sharing, their proprietarydata. Very recently, Lhasa Limited
   organized a hackathon involvingseveral industrial partners in order to
   assess the performance oftheir federated learning platform, called
   ``Effiris{''}.In this paper, we share our experience as Roche in
   participating insuch an event, evaluating the performance of the
   federated algorithmsand comparing them with those coming from our
   in-house-only machinelearning models. Our aim is to highlight the
   advantages of federatedlearning and its intrinsic limitations and also
   suggest some pointsfor potential improvements in the method.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the role of universities is experiencing a conflict:
   institutions need certificated and specialized professionals, and
   students need real knowledge. One hardly could imagine the
   implementation of this combination in the higher education system, even
   at the beginning of the university career. Bachelor's programs indeed
   tend to be overly specialized and dogmatic, careless of those creative
   processes underlying innovation. For these reasons, I suggest two
   innovations to rebalance the strife. The first consists of the
   possibility for each student to actively choose courses, thus creating
   personalized and heterogeneous study careers. The second innovation
   concerns the implementation of hackathon-based teaching to enrich
   learning through cooperation and competition to solve concrete problems.
   I suggest that these improvements would guarantee the formation of
   professionals and allow students to develop actively their system of
   knowledge, as well as they would break down the barriers to innovation
   in higher education.},

Abstract = {Starting as niche programming events, hackathons have since become a
   popular form of collaboration. Events are organized in various domains
   across the globe, aiming to foster innovation and learning, create and
   expand communities and tackle civic and environmental issues. While
   research around such events has grown in recent years, most studies are
   based on observations of a few individuals during an event and on
   post-hoc interviews during which participants report their experiences.
   Such studies are helpful but somewhat limited in that they do not allow
   us to study how individuals communicate at scale using technology. To
   address this gap, we conducted an archival analysis of communication
   traces of teams during a 48-h event. Our findings indicate that teams
   scaffold their communication around the design of an event, influenced
   by milestones set by the organizers. The officially selected
   communication platform's main use was to organize the event and the
   teams and to facilitate contact between participants and hackathon
   officials. We further investigated the balance of intra-team
   communication on the given platform and the potential use of additional
   communication tools.},

Title = {Curricular Hackathons for Engineering Design Learning: The Case of
   Engineering Design Days},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 4},
Abstract = {Contribution: This article defines ``curricular hackathons{''} and
   describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the
   hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience
   implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students
   with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and
   integrative design problems.Background: Design is an essential part of
   engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are
   provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving
   ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year
   capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities
   are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry
   significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon
   format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for
   formative design practice.Research Question: How can the hackathon
   format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology:
   The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight
   from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the
   University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two
   methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an
   interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and
   implementation.Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a
   curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact
   on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social
   experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a
   design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some
   level of integration and/or embedding in a program's curriculum.},

Title = {``I teach it because it is the biggest threat to health{''}: Integrating
   sustainable healthcare into health professions education},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {325-333},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background
   Steering planetary and human health towards a more sustainable future
   demands educated and prepared health professionals.
   Aim
   This research aimed: to explore health professions educators'
   sustainable healthcare education (SHE) knowledge, attitudes,
   self-efficacy and teaching practices across 13 health professions
   courses in one Australian university.
   Methods
   Utilising a sequential mixed-methods design: Phase one (understanding)
   involved an online survey to ascertain educators' SHE knowledge,
   attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices to inform phase two
   (solution generation), `Teach Green' Hackathon. Survey data was
   descriptively analysed and a gap analysis performed to promote
   generation of solutions during phase two. Results from the hackathon
   were thematically analysed to produce five recommendations.
   Results
   Regarding SHE, survey data across 13 health professions disciplines (n =
   163) identified strong content knowledge (90.8\%); however, only
   (36.9\%) reported confidence to `explain' and (44.2\%) to `inspire'
   students. Two thirds of participants (67.5\%) reported not knowing how
   best to teach SHE. Hackathon data revealed three main influencing
   factors: regulatory, policy and socio-cultural drivers.
   Conclusions
   The five actionable recommendations to strengthen interdisciplinary
   capacity to integrate SHE include: inspire multi-level leadership and
   collaboration; privilege student voice; develop a SHE curriculum and
   resources repository; and integrate SHE into course accreditation
   standards.},

Title = {``From Making to Learning{''}: introducing Dev Camps as an educational
   paradigm for Re-inventing Problem-based Learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Dev Camps are events that enable participants to tackle challenges using
   software tools and different kinds of hardware devices in collaborative
   project-style activities. The participants conceptualize and develop
   their solutions in a self-directed way, involving technical,
   organizational and social skills. In this sense, they are autonomous
   producers or ``makers{''}. The Dev Camp activity format resonates with
   skills such as communication, critical thinking, creativity,
   decision-making and planning and can be considered as a bridge between
   education and industry. In this paper we present and analyse our
   experience from a series of such events that were co-organized between
   an industrial partner acting as a host and several university partners.
   We take this as an indication to envision new opportunities for
   projectbased learning in more formal educational scenarios.},

Abstract = {High-impact, transformative educational practices change the way
   students see themselves and others, as well as impart knowledge.
   Practices from the technology industry may offer innovative strategies
   for fostering transformational learning experiences. We developed and
   implemented two innovation techniques-Hackathon and Innovation Time Off
   (ITO)-in a graduate course on social psychology and public health
   nutrition. The Hackathon occurred in the sixth and seventh weeks of the
   course; the last 4 weeks provided 10\% of class time for ITO projects.
   All enrolled students participated in the pilot study (n = 6; M age =
   27.5 years; 83\% female; 67\% White) and completed reflection papers
   during the final exam period. Student learning was assessed from these
   reflection papers using a rubric for transformative versus
   nontransformative changes in five areas: confidence, pride, skills,
   perspective, and identity. Student responses revealed transformative
   changes in perspective (n = 7). Additionally, nontransformative changes
   were found in confidence (n = 1), identity (n = 2), perspective (n = 4),
   and skills (n = 9). This pilot work suggests that the Hackathon and ITO
   contributed to perceived skill-building in problem-solving and teamwork,
   and the Hackathon may have led to transformative changes in perspective;
   ITO may not be appropriate for learners who need structure; high
   confidence remained unchanged; and these strategies are likely to be
   feasible and replicable.},

Title = {Interdisciplinary Online Hackathons as an Approach to Combat the
   COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of
   people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the
   global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together
   communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented
   manner.
   Objective: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in
   the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on
   challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear
   implementation road map for other organizations to follow.
   Methods: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six
   COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and
   researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to
   assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of
   interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects
   realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event,
   participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5
   optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that
   assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and
   their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their
   confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the
   hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also
   provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey.
   Results: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different
   countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75
   mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased
   confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project
   after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they
   were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants
   who provided feedback, 60\% (n=18) would not have started their project
   without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon
   encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building
   interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by
   their mentors, and creating a functional prototype.
   Conclusions: This study provides insights into how online hackathons can
   contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in
   several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity,
   increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster
   and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation,
   organization, and evaluation of this online hackathon are useful for
   other institutions and initiatives that are willing to introduce similar
   event formats in the fight against COVID-19.},

   how to co-design community-based active ageing with older adults via the
   development of a toolkit to support this goal. Rapid reviews were
   conducted to understand (i) the effective behavioural change techniques
   for older adults, (ii) how to co-design with older adults for
   community-based interventions, and (iii) how to design tools for
   behaviour change that are easy to use. These reviews served as the
   foundation for developing a toolkit to support the co-design of
   community-based active ageing, which was evaluated during an
   interdisciplinary hackathon with older adults. Quantitative data from
   the surveys suggested that the confidence levels of students in
   developing interventions for health behaviour change and in co-designing
   with older adults increased after the hackathon, and the enjoyment of
   participating in the hackathon and of using the toolkit were
   statistically significant factors influencing this increase. Qualitative
   data from interviews and observations revealed how the toolkit was
   (un)used by the participants and what aspects of the toolkit can be
   improved. We encourage future researchers and practitioners to apply and
   adapt our research findings to the communities of older adults that they
   are working with.},

Abstract = {Globally observed trends in aging indicate that older adults constitute
   a growing share of the population and an increasing demographic in the
   modern technologies marketplace. Therefore, it has become important to
   address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of
   developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we
   approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young
   programmers and older adults participants. Below we describe a case
   study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older
   adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our
   results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good
   practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar
   events and an improved process of developing apps that target older
   adults.},

Abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests,
   hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention
   from practitioners and researchers. Yet there is a paucity of research
   on corporate hackathons, which are nearly ubiquitous and present
   significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges. To
   provide a comprehensive understanding of team processes and broad array
   of outcomes of corporate hackathons, we conducted a mixed-methods,
   multiple case study of five teams that participated in a large scale
   corporate hackathon. Two teams were ``pre-existing{''} teams (PETs) and
   three were newly-formed ``flash{''} teams (FTs). Our analysis revealed
   that PETs coordinated almost as if it was just another day at the office
   while creating innovations within the boundary of their regular work,
   whereas FTs adopted role-based coordination adapted to the hackathon
   context while creating innovations beyond the boundary of their regular
   work. Project sustainability depended on how much effort the team put
   into finding a home for their projects and whether their project was a
   good fit with existing products in the organization's product portfolio.
   Moreover, hackathon participation had perceived positive effects on
   participants' skills, careers, and social networks.},

Abstract = {Experiential learning is an effective method to teach User Experience
   (UX) to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Despite its
   popularity, there seems to be no comprehensive overview on (1) the
   current use of experiential learning in UX education at universities and
   (2) student learning outcomes and benefits resulting from the use of
   experiential learning. Hence, we conducted a scoping review to provide
   such overview. We analyzed 45 articles published from 2000 to 2021 and
   we found 12 types of experiential learning employed by HCI educators:
   applied research project, industry/community research project, hands-on
   activity, role-play, interactive workshops, guest speakers, in-house
   work placement, internship, flipped classroom, field project, lab, and
   design hackathon, from most to least frequent. Twenty-six articles
   reported student learning outcomes and benefits: (1) enhanced UX
   technical knowledge, (2) applied textbook knowledge into practice, (3)
   acquired soft skills, (4) student satisfaction, (5) increased awareness
   of user diversity, and (6) increased job marketability. Overall, we
   advance current HCI teaching practices by providing HCI educators with a
   list of experiential learning types that they can adopt in their classes
   to teach UX.},

Abstract = {Purpose Technological platforms encourage the exchange of knowledge and
   creation of new ideas that create new value for participating members
   who pool and combine their knowledge, facilities, tools and skills, thus
   contributing to the development of innovative solutions. This paper
   focuses on hackathon platforms, working as open innovation
   intermediaries, investigating their role and functions and exploring how
   they encourage the collaboration and the innovativeness among
   participants in order to boost their innovative new ideas.
   Design/methodology/approach The research method is a qualitative design
   that includes in-depth interviews of ten stakeholders that play
   different roles in ``Hack for Travel,{''} the case under analysis. It is
   a hackathon organized entirely online, as a response to the crisis
   generated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Findings Findings
   revealed six processes developed by the hackathon platform used to
   effectively organize the event and facilitate participants to cooperate
   and share knowledge in order to boost the spread of innovative ideas.
   Results identify how hackathons should be organized and through which
   processes they work as innovation platforms. Originality/value This is
   one of the first attempts to study the increasing phenomenon of
   hackathons, providing theoretical contribution and practical
   implications about their role in developing innovation.},

Title = {Global Surgery Hackathons: A Case Study From Pakistan},
Journal = {SURGICAL INNOVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {496-501},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background. Hackathons aim to solve problems in a selected field by
   bringing together people from multiple domains and combining their
   expertise. Global surgery is an emerging field with a huge burden of
   disease and massive implications for bettering health care. In this
   study, we describe the first Global Surgery Hackathon held in Pakistan
   and analyze the impacts of the hack and post-hack incubation. Methods.
   This research study used data collected from a Hackathon held at the Aga
   Khan University (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and progress from the
   post-hack incubation teams. Data were collected from applications, from
   sign-in attendance, via evaluation forms, and milestone tracking of the
   incubation teams. A list of factors such as sectors addressed by winning
   projects and grants received was made. Results. The evaluations provided
   by the participants were positive, with mean scores of 4.00 (SD = .78)
   out of 5 on a Likert scale. Pitches made (n = 69, 68\%) by the 109
   participants were sorted into 5 categories: workplace, access, quality,
   safety, and design. Fifteen teams were formed, out of which 5 were
   accepted for incubation. All teams had a minimum viable product at the
   one-year mark. Conclusion. Hackathons are a reliable way to come up with
   effective solutions for targeted problems in various areas of health
   care and using the methodology of a Hackathon, a pool of low-cost,
   innovative solutions can be generated. These solutions can definitely
   impact health outcomes, especially for the field of global surgery.
   Further statistics should be collected to affirm the incubated
   solutions' impact.},

Abstract = {Background Hackathons aim to develop solutions to preidentified problem
   domains and catalyse startup cultures. Recently, the teaching and
   learning potential of hackathons has also been documented. In this
   study, we make the case for utilisation of hackathons as an alternative
   teaching and learning tool geared towards entrepreneurship and as an
   opportunity for interprofessional integration.
   Methods This research study followed up with participants from the third
   hackathon at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. Hack MedEd
   was about solutions to problems of undergraduate and postgraduate
   medical education with an emphasis on low--income to middle-income
   countries. Participant evaluation data were filled at the end of the
   hackathon and gathered from three focused group discussions (FGDs):
   immediately before and after the event, a delayed follow-up after 11
   months was recorded.
   Results Of 116 participants, the majority (71\%) were under 30 years
   old, and over half were female. The evaluations provided by hackers were
   positive overall with a mean score of 4.37 out of 5 on a Likert Scale.
   During the FGDs, participants spoke positively of the process and felt
   that, by the end of the hackathon, they had learnt something new. In the
   delayed follow-up FGD, teams that had undergone incubation expressed
   that they had gained a critical and simple skillset that they might not
   have acquired otherwise.
   Conclusion Hackathons business incubation programmes may be considered
   an alternative teaching and learning tool-especially for individuals
   studying or working within the healthcare discipline within
   low--resource settings.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a rare disease in US,
   however, they account for 8-17\% of deaths in people with epilepsy. This
   disease involves complicated physiological patterns and it is still not
   clear what are the physio-/bio-makers that can be used as an indicator
   to predict SUDEP so that care providers can intervene and treat patients
   in a timely manner. For this sake, UTHealth School of Biomedical
   Informatics (SBMI) organized a machine learning Hackathon to call for
   advanced solutions
   https://sbmi.uth.edu/hackathon/archive/sept19.htm.MethodsIn recent
   years, deep learning has become state of the art for many domains with
   large amounts data. Although healthcare has accumulated a lot of data,
   they are often not abundant enough for subpopulation studies where deep
   learning could be beneficial. Taking these limitations into account, we
   present a framework to apply deep learning to the detection of the onset
   of slow activity after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, as well as
   other EEG signal detection problems exhibiting data paucity.ResultsWe
   conducted ten training runs for our full method and seven model
   variants, statistically demonstrating the impact of each technique used
   in our framework with a high degree of confidence.ConclusionsOur
   findings point toward deep learning being a viable method for detection
   of the onset of slow activity provided approperiate regularization is
   performed.},

Abstract = {Education for sustainability (EfS) in the hospitality sector is
   increasingly recognised as one of the driving forces for sustainable
   development. One way of fostering sustainability in the hospitality
   industry is through sustainability hackathons, which are intensive
   events focusing on ``hacking{''} new sustainability ideas. This paper
   critically explores how the hospitality industry designs and executes
   sustainability hackathons within the context of EfS. An exploratory case
   study was conducted on the Scandic Hotels chain. Data utilised including
   both relevant reports and in-depth interviews with the highest level of
   management of Scandic. The execution of the sustainability hackathon
   illuminates how value-based education, creative problem-solving and
   co-opetition were critical aspects to foster EfS in the hospitality
   industry. Moreover, the hackathon facilitators, i.e. the hotels' General
   Managers, were found to play an essential part in shaping the
   sustainability education and the event's potential impacts. This paper
   contributes to expand knowledge on EfS offered by the hospitality
   industry (as opposed to EfS in formal educational institutions) and make
   practical recommendations on how sustainability hackathons could be
   better facilitated by hotel chains.},

Title = {Hackathons as Stepping Stones in Health Care Innovation: Case Study With
   Systematic Recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background: Until recently, developing health technologies was
   time-consuming and expensive, and often involved patients, doctors, and
   other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end
   product. So far, users have been minimally involved in the ideation and
   creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address
   users' unmet needs, a transdisciplinary and user-led approach, involving
   cocreation and direct user feedback, is required. In this context,
   hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating
   enthusiasm for user-centered innovation.
   Objective: This case study describes preparatory steps and the
   performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health
   care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were
   assessed, leading to the development of systematic recommendations for
   future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care.
   Methods: A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin,
   Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field
   notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the
   research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in
   December 2017 and November 2018 were included.
   Results: In total, 30 participants took part, with 63\% (19/30) of
   participants between 25 and 34 years of age, 30\% (9/30) between 35 and
   44 years of age, and 7\% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of
   43\% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of
   medical experts, including patients and health care professionals, was
   30\% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a
   specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a
   chatbot for skin cancer recognition, an augmented reality exposure-based
   therapy (eg, for arachnophobia), an app for medical neighborhood
   connectivity, a doctor appointment platform, and a self-care app for
   people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals
   initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in
   significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was
   followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for
   conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n <= 30) were developed, including
   aspects of community building, stakeholder engagement, mentoring,
   themes, announcements, follow-up, and timing for each step.
   Conclusions: This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing
   innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and
   potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital
   product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to
   other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led
   innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary
   hackathons.},

Abstract = {Hackathons are time-bounded collaborative events that typically take
   between 1 and 3 days of intense teamwork to build prototypes usually in
   the form of software, aiming to specific challenges proposed by the
   organizers. These events became a widespread practice in the IT
   industry, in universities and in many other scenarios, as a result of a
   growing open-innovation trend in the last decade. Since the main
   deliverable of these events is a demonstrable version of an idea, such
   as early hardware or software prototypes, the short time frame requires
   participants to quickly understand the proposed challenge or even
   identify issues related to a given domain. To create solutions, teams
   follow an ad-hoc but effective design approach, that many times seems
   informal since the background of the participants is rather centered on
   technical aspects (e.g., web and mobile programming) and does not
   involve any training in design thinking. To understand this creative
   process, we conducted a set of 37 interviews with people from 16
   countries, consisting of 32 hackathons winners and 5 hackathon
   organizers. We aimed to identify the design practices (i.e., processes
   and recurring design methods) that are applied by winners in these types
   of events. Also, we conducted a focus group with 8 people experienced in
   hackathons (participants and organizers) to discuss our findings. Our
   analysis revealed that although hackathon winners with IT background
   have no formal training in design thinking, they are aware of many
   design methods and typically follow a sequence of phases that involve
   divergent and convergent thinking to explore the problem space and
   propose alternatives in a solution space, which is the rationale behind
   design thinking. We derived a set of recommendations based on design
   strategies that seem to lead to successful hackathon participation.
   These recommendations can also be useful to organizers who intend to
   enhance the experience of newcomers in hackathons.},

Title = {Learning to empathize with users through design thinking in hybrid mode:
   Insights from two educational case studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {207},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {COVID-19 has imposed new educational challenges, including the need to
   prepare students to the new era of hybrid work. This research aimed to
   shed new light on the manner in which students learn and practice hybrid
   work in educational settings. To this end, two educational studies were
   performed, for examining students practicing design thinking (DT) in
   hybrid mode and the development of their empathy skills during this
   expe-rience. The main case study was conducted in an academic
   hackathon-like course, where students addressed loneliness-related
   challenges during four full days using a configured web platform. In a
   follow-up case study, the adaptability of this approach to small-scale
   settings of a 90-minute DT workshop was explored. The students filled in
   questionnaires, which examined their empathy development in three
   dimensions: Skill, Orientation, and Being. The findings show the
   benefits of the web platform and the extent to which these academic
   educational programs fostered empathy and innovation and highlights the
   challenges, opportunities, and benefits of fostering new educational
   programs that allow hybrid participation, involving external
   stakeholders, and guide the stu-dents to handle real challenges. Such
   hybrid academic programs can prepare students for the hybrid,
   multi-disciplinary work reality towards developing human-centered
   solutions.},

Abstract = {Internet routes controlled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) carry
   our communication and our commerce, yet many aspects of routing are
   opaque to even network operators, and BGP is known to contribute to
   performance, reliability, and security problems. The research and
   operations communities have developed a set of tools and data sources
   for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on February 2016 we
   organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live measurement and
   monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included students,
   researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding agencies,
   working together on projects to measure, visualize, and improve routing
   or the tools we use to study routing. This report describes the tools
   used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of the projects. The
   Hackathon was a success, and we look forward to future iterations.},

Abstract = {Over last few decades, innovation became one of the most meaningful
   resources for successful management. In order to spark invention, the
   first step of innovation, a number of methods have been introduced
   including hackathon. This paper evaluates 14 hackathons over a period of
   over 3 years from various perspectives and with an ethnographic approach
   and different research methods- observation, 36 semi-structured
   interviews and netnography. Material analysis has been performed with
   methods of grounder theory, as well as machine learning as a
   triangulation method. As a result, types and approaches of hackathon,
   together with a new empirical definition, ways of how this method
   mitigates drawbacks of brain storming and a unique relationship between
   concepts of preparation difficulty and likelihood of desired invention
   at the hackathon have been introduced and presented.},

Abstract = {To develop the next generation of healthcare innovators, students at all
   levels of education should be trained and encouraged to employ
   innovative and entrepreneurial approaches to deal with complicated
   challenges of today's health system. Applying innovation and
   entrepreneurship training to solve complex problems and focus on
   solution design has recently become common in medical universities all
   over the world. This paper clarifies the role of hackathons as an
   innovative educational approach in healthcare education systems. We
   propose a process model concerned with organizing hackathon events in
   the healthcare education system. This model can be used in the academic
   and practical design of hackathons for innovation purposes.},

Abstract = {Hackathons are events that are a sort of application development
   marathons - lasting between 24 and 48 hours - that became increasingly
   popular as a method for fast learning and bring people in a short space
   of time to make creative projects. However, the number of women
   participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when
   considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers,
   designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to
   understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We
   sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them
   avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a
   female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of
   Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE ARTS},

Abstract = {Machine learning offers great potential to developers and end users in
   the creative industries. For example, it can support new sensor-based
   interactions, procedural content generation and end-user product
   customisation. However, designing machine learning toolkits for adoption
   by creative developers is still a nascent effort. This work focuses on
   the application of user-centred design with creative end-user developers
   for informing the design of an interactive machine learning toolkit. We
   introduce a framework for user-centred design actions that we developed
   within the context of an European Union innovation project, RAPID-MIX.
   We illustrate the application of the framework with two actions for
   lightweight formative evaluation of our toolkit-the JUCE Machine
   Learning Hackathon and the RAPID-MIX API workshop at eNTERFACE'17. We
   describe how we used these actions to uncover conceptual and technical
   limitations. We also discuss how these actions provided us with a better
   understanding of users, helped us to refine the scope of the design
   space, and informed improvements to the toolkit. We conclude with a
   reflection about the knowledge we obtained from applying user-centred
   design to creative technology, in the context of an innovation project
   in the creative industries.},

Abstract = {Educational hackathons are a new way to respond to some of the biggest
   challenges in education. This exploratory study seeks to define the key
   elements of these hackathons and to offer a theoretical and practical
   starting point for future publications and research. A literature review
   is carried out, with the information then contrasted with the experience
   as organizers of EDhack Raval, the first community-focussed educational
   hackathon in Catalonia. Observations, a questionnaire and interviews are
   used to add depth and objectivity to the wealth of data derived from
   field work. The results point to the valorization of the freedom of the
   creative process, the generation of community networks and social
   learning over the creation of solutions, findings that coincide with the
   latest research.
   Thus, the study concludes that educational agents would do well to
   appropriate, adapt and evaluate the assets of the hacker culture, making
   sure not to commit the error or organising hackathons that promote
   solutionism, elitism and competition.},

Abstract = {Hackathon has been growing and taking various industries by storm thanks
   to its flexibility and ability to fit into them. It has been proven
   successful and helpful in solving different IT and non-IT challenges.
   They also serve as an intriguing educational and networking tool,
   encouraging people to pursue innovative studies and activities. However,
   a hackathon is like a two-edged sword with its downsides - it requires
   significant investment and can fail if mismanaged. It is critical to
   recruit and gather participants suitable to face a particular
   technological or non-technological challenge and to motivate a group to
   perform innovative action and benefit from the learning-by-doing
   approach. This paper identifies 21 reasons to attend hackathons backed
   by existing research and presents a study conducted on 109 hackathon
   participants that help to score, rank and explain those attributes.
   Results have proven the importance of challenge and networking over
   monetary prizes and glory.},

Title = {Machine Learning Benchmarks for the Classification of Equivalent Circuit

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for
   electrochemical systems often consists of defining an Equivalent Circuit
   Model (ECM) using expert knowledge and then optimizing the model
   parameters to deconvolute various resistance, capacitive, inductive, or
   diffusion responses. For small data sets, this procedure can be
   conducted manually; however, it is not feasible to manually define a
   proper ECM for extensive data sets with a wide range of EIS responses.
   Automatic identification of an ECM would substantially accelerate the
   analysis of large sets of EIS data. We showcase machine learning methods
   to classify the ECMs of 9,300 impedance spectra provided by QuantumScape
   for the BatteryDEV hackathon. The best-performing approach is a
   gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically
   generate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw
   spectral data. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of
   Nyquist representations is presented as an alternative, although it
   achieves a lower accuracy. We publish the data and open source the
   associated code. The approaches described in this article can serve as
   benchmarks for further studies. A key remaining challenge is the
   identifiability of the labels, underlined by the model performances and
   the comparison of misclassified spectra.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a large-scale virtual hackathon where we
   observed the way participants found collaborators and undertook
   innovation processes entirely in the virtual world. As an emerging
   social-technical practice, the virtual hackathon leverages the power of
   familiar strangers, the improvisation of low-cost digital services, and
   the crowdsourcing mechanism to enable open innovation under the
   constraint of physical distancing. This study contributes to the
   research by introducing and conceptualizing a modified artifact -
   virtual hackathon. The implication of and the lessons learnt from the
   virtual hackathon are applicable and generalizable to organizations when
   managing virtual collaborations, digital infrastructure, and open
   innovation.},

Abstract = {The author reviews in brief the concepts of and terminology in
   information literacy and analyzes the content of ``information
   literacy{''} concept. She emphasizes the need for information Literacy
   knowledge and skills to promote sustainable personal development. The
   experience of the academic library of Novosibirsk State University of
   Economics and Management (NSUEM) in organizing practice-oriented lessons
   with innovative game models like Intellectual workshops{''},
   ``Bibliographic pursuit{''}, ``Bibliographic hackathon{''}, is
   discussed. These models proved to be effective. The practice-oriented
   lessons and final assessment can be organized both online and offline.
   Individual student consulting is also significant for building
   information literacy. The author concludes that information literacy
   makes an essential part of continuing education. Academic libraries have
   every opportunity to promote, consult, and navigate their users through
   the world of information.},

Abstract = {The quest for invention has become crucial for the economic development,
   with the rise of IT technologies and the process of innovation becoming
   shorter. Hackathon has proven to be a novel invention development
   method, yet its popularity posed a major challenge of standardization
   and management. This paper analyses research performed on 14 hackathons,
   which leads to a deeper understating of processes within the hackathon
   method. An introduction to the relationship between hackathon
   approaches, types, and invention development process are presented. The
   hackathon invention framework and the hackathon equilibrium management
   concept are introduced allowing for the understanding of how different
   preparations and decisions may determine the expectations and the
   probability of the desired invention as the result of the hackathon.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},

Pages = {350-363},

Abstract = {Creating accessible events is a pressing issue for many music
   organisations. In the United States, the term accessibility has strong
   ties to disability, and it is an important concept because what is
   deemed accessible directly impacts who is included and excluded from
   music experiences. Music Community Lab (MCL) runs a series of events in
   New York City called Monthly Music Hackathon NYC. They aim to promote
   `diversity across backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities'. This
   instrumental case study sought to examine how MCL participants
   conceptualise accessibility as well as analyze participants' suggestions
   for improving the accessibility of MCL events. Sixty-two people who
   attended one of three MCL events completed a demographic survey and 57
   of those respondents participated in an interview. Findings reveal that
   63\% (n = 36) of participants associated accessibility with inclusivity
   and 35\% (n = 20) of participants associated accessibility with ease of
   access to resources, places, and experiences. Participants' suggestions
   for improving accessibility included social media marketing (n = 23;
   40\%) and ease of access approaches (n = 11; 19\%) including CART, ASL,
   and live streaming events. Accessibility is challenging for community
   music groups like MCL to navigate because it is a complex construct with
   varied interpretations.},

Abstract = {Public procurement of innovation is a key policy instrument for
   improving the quality of public services and achieving wider benefits
   for society. Recently, innovation contests have re-emerged as a means to
   procure innovative new solutions. There is, however, limited
   understanding of how innovation contests should be organized in the
   public sector. In this study, we investigate the organization of two
   smart city hackathon-style innovation contests in Tampere, Finland. We
   examine the contests' structure and goals, the definition of a problem
   statement, the motivation of potential participants, and their outcomes.
   We find that innovation contests may be used for, not only sourcing
   novel technologies, but also for engaging in conversations with
   companies, and developing an understanding of local problems and
   potential solutions. We further discuss the issues that arise from the
   integration of multiple goals in a single contest. We provide practical
   guidance for organizing innovation contests and evaluate their role for
   public procurement of innovation and local development.},

Abstract = {The hackathon was developed by practitioners and it could be said that
   they used structures and characteristics from other invention
   development methods that intend to spark creativity. This paper aims to
   define and evaluate those characteristics that serve as determinants of
   invention. It analyses research performed on 14 different hackathons
   with the following ethnographic approach: 1000 h of observation, 36
   semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography (netnography).
   Collected data has been analysed with the use of grounded theory methods
   and machine learning, which has been introduced as a triangulation
   method. As a result 9 main characteristics within the hackathon method
   that serve as invention determinants were discovered and holistically
   described. The identified elements have been backed by different
   theoretical backgrounds, but as one they form a flexible and unique
   mixture that helps to understand the hackathon phenomenon, potential
   hazards and its inner mechanisms. The discovered characteristics can
   help in effective organization of hackathons in the future.},

Abstract = {A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer
   hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by
   problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop
   creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the
   evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed
   practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57)
   developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented
   in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5),
   evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The
   evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon
   promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of
   concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged
   were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred
   that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More
   research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of
   social work curricula including the teaching of various research
   methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work
   profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt
   social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and
   e-consultation might benefit from Hackathon brainstorming.},

Abstract = {In 2016, the INSPIRE Conference hosted the first INSPIRE hackathon on
   volunteered geographic information and citizen observatories, also known
   as the INSPIRE Hackathon. The organisers, mostly representatives of
   European research and innovation projects, continued this activity with
   the next INSPIRE Conference in 2017. The INSPIRE Hackathon is a
   collaborative event for developers, researchers, designers and others
   interested in open data, volunteered geographic information and citizen
   observatories. The main driving force for the INSPIRE Hackathon is
   provided by experts from existing EU projects, and its primary objective
   is to share knowledge and experience between the participants and
   demonstrate to wider audiences the power of data and information
   supported by modern technologies and common standards, originating from
   INSPIRE, Copernicus, GEOSS and other initiatives. This paper describes
   the history and background of the INSPIRE Hackathon, the various
   INSPIRE-related hackathons already organised, supporting projects, the
   results of INSPIRE Hackathon 2017 and the authors' vision of future
   activities.},

Title = {The 2006 NESCent Phyloinformatics Hackathon: A Field Report},
Journal = {EVOLUTIONARY BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {3},
Pages = {287-296},
Abstract = {In December, 2006, a group of 26 software developers from some of the
   most widely used life science programming toolkits and phylogenetic
   software projects converged on Durham, North Carolina, for a
   Phyloinformatics Hackathon, an intense five-day collaborative software
   coding event sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center
   (NESCent). The goal was to help researchers to integrate multiple
   phylogenetic software tools into automated workflows. Participants
   addressed deficiencies in interoperability between programs by
   implementing ``glue code{''} and improving support for phylogenetic data
   exchange standards (particularly NEXUS) across the toolkits. The work
   was guided by use-cases compiled in advance by both developers and
   users, and the code was documented as it was developed. The resulting
   software is freely available for both users and developers through
   incorporation into the distributions of several widely-used open-source
   toolkits. We explain the motivation for the hackathon, how it was
   organized, and discuss some of the outcomes and lessons learned. We
   conclude that hackathons are an effective mode of solving problems in
   software interoperability and usability, and are underutilized in
   scientific software development.},

Abstract = {The National Science Foundation (NSF) 2018 Materials and Data Science
   Hackathon (MATDAT18) took place at the Residence Inn Alexandria Old
   Town/Duke Street, Alexandria, VA over the period May 30-June 1, 2018.
   This three-day collaborative ``hackathon{''} or ``datathon{''} brought
   together teams of materials scientists and data scientists to
   collaboratively engage materials science problems using data science
   tools. The materials scientists brought a diversity of problems ranging
   from inorganic material bandgap prediction to acceleration of ab initio
   molecular dynamics to quantification of aneurysm risk from blood
   hydrodynamics. The data scientists contributed tools and expertise in
   areas such as deep learning, Gaussian process regression, and sequential
   learning with which to engage these problems. Participants lived and
   worked together, collaboratively ``hacked{''} for several hours per day,
   delivered introductory, midpoint, and final presentations and were
   exposed to presentations and informal interactions with NSF personnel.
   Social events were organized to facilitate interactions between teams.
   The primary outcomes of the event were to seed new collaborations
   between materials and data scientists and generate preliminary results.
   A separate competitive process enabled participants to apply for
   exploratory funding to continue work commenced at the hackathon.
   Anonymously surveyed participants reported a high level of satisfaction
   with the event, with 100\% of respondents indicating that their team
   will continue to work together into the future and 91\% reporting intent
   to submit a white paper for exploratory funding.},

Journal = {DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION},

Abstract = {African genomic medicine and microbiome datasets are usually not well
   characterized in terms of their origin, making it difficult to find and
   extract data for specific African ethnic groups or even countries. The
   Pan-African H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) recognized the
   need for developing data portals for African genomic medicine and
   African microbiomes to address this and ran a hackathon to initiate
   their development. The two portals were designed and significant
   progress was made in their development during the hackathon. All the
   participants worked in a very synergistic and collaborative atmosphere
   in order to achieve the hackathon's goals. The participants were divided
   into content and technical teams and worked over a period of 6 days. In
   response to one of the survey questions of what the participants liked
   the most during the hackathon, 55\% of the hackathon participants
   highlighted the familial and friendly atmosphere, the team work and the
   diversity of team members and their expertise. This paper describes the
   preparations for the portals hackathon and the interaction between the
   participants and reflects upon the lessons learned about its impact on
   successfully developing the two data portals as well as building
   scientific expertise of younger African researchers.},

Abstract = {Background and purpose: The need for disruptive innovation within the
   pharmacy profession is well documented in the literature. However, there
   is a lack of proper training on innovation and creative thinking for
   student pharmacists and limited time or incentive for health care
   practitioners to be innovative. Hosting an innovation event, such as a
   hackathon, can teach innovative strategies and incentivize innovation by
   student pharmacists. Thus, the aim of this study was to to assess the
   feasibility and student perception of an inaugural school of pharmacy
   hackathon pilot. Educational activity and setting: A hackathon pilot was
   planned on a distant site campus. Over the course of four months, a
   planning team, consisting of a faculty member and a student leader in
   the American Pharmacy Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists, met
   every other week to plan the event. Outcomes included: change in student
   excitement and interest related to the hackathon, number of
   participants, and change in student confidence in the ability to perform
   steps in the innovation process. Findings: The average level of
   excitement prior to the event increased, and student confidence related
   to the ability to perform each step in the innovation process improved.
   Additionally, students agreed that they would be interested in attending
   a similar event in the future and would recommend the event to a friend.
   Summary: Hosting a healthcare hackathon at a school of pharmacy is an
   enjoyable way for pharmacy students to practice and gain confidence with
   innovation skills while addressing Accreditation Council for Pharmacy
   Education Standard 4.3.},

Abstract = {In 2020 Pakistan's first-ever hackathon on school emergencies was
   organised, where schools and community stakeholders collaborated to
   deconstruct problems and develop solutions. The study aimed to
   investigate participants' motivation for and experiences of the
   hackathon. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from
   hackers, mentors, judges and organisers before, during and after the
   event. Findings indicate diversity amongst participants in terms of age,
   gender and experiences. The hackers' motivations were both intrinsic and
   extrinsic. The challenges were insufficient time, absence of investors,
   inconsistent mentoring, low participation from public schools and
   imbalanced gender participation. The hackathon provided a unique
   opportunity for multidisciplinary collaborative problem-solving and
   accessing experts for creativity and innovation. Future research should
   focus on increasing participation and fostering social innovations
   through school-based civic hackathons.},

Abstract = {The OPEN Hackathon of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) 2020 set
   out to address challenges and potential solutions for medical edu-cation
   at the School of Medicine to kick off the 2020/21 winter semester. The
   event lasted 36 hours, during which medical students, teachers and staff
   members had the opportunity to tackle current problems in education and
   to develop co-created, customized solutions through creative teamwork
   for the School of Medicine at the TUM. The resulting solutions are now
   being realized and implemented in teaching. This paper describes the
   process and organization of the hackathon. Furthermore, the result of
   the evaluation of the event are described. In this paper, we aim to
   present the project as a valuable pioneer in the field of developing
   medical-educational topics within the framework of innovative
   methodological formats.},

   corporations and police forces-face challenges promoting diversity and
   inclusion among their workers and affiliates. Instead of training and
   regulations, recent research recommends mechanisms that engage managers
   and leaders in activities that involve behavioral changes. This article
   describes how we put the managerial engagement approach into practice by
   organizing a ``Diversity and Inclusion Hackathon{''} at the 2018 annual
   meeting of the American Political Science Association. With 11 teams
   focused on a range of topics, the hackathon attracted more than 200
   people and produced multiple outputs. It engaged scholars from a range
   of backgrounds, social identities, institutions, ranks, and beliefs in
   the generation of new norms, programmatic ideas, and plans for the
   profession. Although we cannot infer causality, analysis of the APSA
   Annual Meeting evaluation survey reveals that hackathon participants are
   significantly more likely to express positive perceptions of the
   conference.},

Abstract = {UNESCO World Heritage cities can become smart cities if they take into
   account their cultural heritage and integrate diverse actors, including
   universities in their innovation practices. This article addresses the
   hackathon as an innovation contest method in the urban and educational
   context. Specifically, it concentrates on hackathon design, particularly
   the focus of the event, as well as the outputs. Although the design
   plays an integral part in a hackathon, particularly in goal achievement,
   design has not yet been thoroughly studied in mainly descriptive
   hackathon research. To address the subject, this article presents a case
   study of a dual-focused, i.e., combined urban and educational hackathon
   in the City of Rauma, which has a World Heritage Old Town that aims to
   integrate its historical uniqueness with modern city services. As a
   result, the article portrays the process and outputs of a hackathon
   carried out with the collaboration of two higher education institutions
   (HEIs) and the Entrepreneur Association of Rauma. Presenting conclusions
   for both academics and the public sector, the article contributes to the
   literature on urban and educational hackathons in smart cities with a
   heritage context.},

Abstract = {Gamification methods adapt the mechanics of games to educational
   environments for the improvement of the teaching-learning process.
   Serious games play an important role as tools for gamification, in
   particular in the context of software engineering courses because of the
   idiosyncratic nature of the topic. However, the studies on the
   improvement of student performance resulting from the use of
   gamification and serious games in courses with different contexts are
   not conclusive. More empirical research is thus needed to obtain
   reliable results on the effectiveness, benefits and drawbacks. The
   overall objective of this work is to study the benefits generated by
   serious games in the teaching-learning process of Computer Engineering
   degrees, analyzing the impact on the motivation and student
   satisfaction, as well as on the learning outcomes and results finally
   achieved. To this end, an intervention is proposed in the subject of
   Computer Architecture based on two components covering theoretical and
   practical sessions. In the theoretical sessions, a serious game
   experience using Kahoot has been introduced, complementing the master
   classes and class exercises. For the practical sessions, the development
   of projects with groups of students has been proposed, whose results in
   terms of computer performance can be compared through a competition
   (hackathon). Evaluation of the serious game-based intervention has been
   approached in terms of student satisfaction and motivation, as well as
   improved academic performance. In order to assess student satisfaction,
   surveys have been used to assess the effect on student motivation and
   satisfaction. For the evaluation of academic performance, a comparative
   analysis between an experimental and a control group has been carried
   out, noting a slight increase in the experimental group students' marks.},

Abstract = {The `Time is Brain{''} concept has been a major focus in the World
   Stroke Awareness Campaign. Objective: We describe our experience with a
   Hackathon (junction of hack+marathon), a 24 hour event of innovation-
   and technology-based project development, focused around detecting
   stroke. Method: The Hackathon was held during a Brazilian Student's
   union (BRASA) congress involving students from engineering and other
   technological disciplines. Results: Four teamscompleted the 24-hour
   challenge; two teams opted the stroke challenge. One team proposed
   improving detection using a mobile sensor Fit-Bit combined with a
   smart-phone to contact emergency dispatch. The other team developed a
   game, in which kids would play a role as a neurologist; to diagnosis
   stroke with objective to increase awareness. Conclusion: Hackathons can
   focus attention on innovation and improvement opportunities to support
   the World Stroke Campaign, as well as other campaigns to raise awareness
   for other health or social problems.},

Abstract = {Introduction: There is a growing literature demonstrating the benefits
   of engaging knowledge-users throughout the research process. We engaged
   a multi-stakeholder team to undertake a hackathon as part of an
   integrated knowledge translation (iKT) process to develop
   nonpharmacological interventions to enhance the economic lives of people
   with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aims of this research were
   to (1) increase understanding of the economic challenges of living with
   SLE through stakeholder engagement at a research hackathon; (2)
   investigate possible interventions to improve the economic lives of
   individuals affected by SLE in Canada; and (3) document the outcomes of
   the Waterlupus hackathon.
   Methods: Waterlupus was held at the University of Waterloo in May 2019,
   attended by lupus advocacy organization representatives, researchers,
   physicians, individuals with lived experience and students. We conducted
   participant observation with participants' understanding and consent;
   notes from the hackathon were qualitatively analyzed to document
   hackathon outcomes.
   Results: At the conclusion of the 28-hour hackathon event, five teams
   pitched nonpharmacological interventions to address the economic
   challenges of living with SLE. The winning team's pitch focussed on
   increasing accessibility of affordable sun-protective clothing. Other
   Waterlupus outcomes include increased awareness of SLE among
   participants, and professional and informal networking opportunities.
   Conclusion: This paper contributes to a limited literature on health
   hackathons. The successful outcomes of Waterlupus emphasize the value of
   hackathons as an iKT tool. Research about how knowledge-users perceive
   hackathons is an important next step.},

Title = {Learning Models for Traumatic Brain Injury Mortality Prediction on
   Pediatric Electronic Health Records},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {BackgroundTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of
   injury related mortality in the world, with severe cases reaching
   mortality rates of 30-40\%. It is highly heterogeneous both in causes
   and consequences, complicating medical interpretation and prognosis.
   Gathering clinical, demographic, and laboratory data to perform a
   prognosis requires time and skill in several clinical specialties.
   Machine learning (ML) methods can take advantage of the data and guide
   physicians toward a better prognosis and, consequently, better
   healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop and test a wide
   range of machine learning models and evaluate their capability of
   predicting mortality of TBI, at hospital discharge, while assessing the
   similarity between the predictive value of the data and clinical
   significance. MethodsThe used dataset is the Hackathon Pediatric
   Traumatic Brain Injury (HPTBI) dataset, composed of electronic health
   records containing clinical annotations and demographic data of 300
   patients. Four different classification models were tested, either with
   or without feature selection. For each combination of the classification
   model and feature selection method, the area under the receiver operator
   curve (ROC-AUC), balanced accuracy, precision, and recall were
   calculated. ResultsMethods based on decision trees perform better when
   using all features (Random Forest, AUC = 0.86 and XGBoost, AUC = 0.91)
   but other models require prior feature selection to obtain the best
   results (k-Nearest Neighbors, AUC = 0.90 and Artificial Neural Networks,
   AUC = 0.84). Additionally, Random Forest and XGBoost allow assessing the
   feature's importance, which could give insights for future strategies on
   the clinical routine. ConclusionPredictive capability depends greatly on
   the combination of model and feature selection methods used but,
   overall, ML models showed a very good performance in mortality
   prediction for TBI. The feature importance results indicate that
   predictive value is not directly related to clinical significance.},

Title = {An Extended Hackathon Model for Collaborative Education in Medical
   Innovation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {To support the next generation of healthcare innovators - whether they
   be engineers, designers, clinicians, or business experts by training -
   education in the emerging field of medical innovation should be made
   easily and widely accessible to undergraduate students, graduate
   students, and young professionals, early in their careers. Currently,
   medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or
   year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a
   limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure
   and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that
   seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible
   and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended
   hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245
   participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016,
   2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo
   Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to
   self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were
   administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants
   hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of
   expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161)
   saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1\%, P<0.001) from their pre-
   to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is
   presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and
   graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation.
   Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten
   categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of
   extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation
   knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of
   participants surveyed.},

Title = {Healthcare Hackathons Provide Educational and Innovation Opportunities:
   A Case Study and Best Practice Recommendations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Physicians and other healthcare professionals are often the end users of
   medical innovation; however, they are rarely involved in the beginning
   design stages. This often results in ineffective healthcare solutions
   with poor adoption rates. At the early design stage, innovation would
   benefit from input from healthcare professionals. This report describes
   the first-ever rehabilitation hackathon-an interdisciplinary and
   competitive team event aimed at accelerating and improving healthcare
   solutions and providing an educational experience for participants.
   Hackathons are gaining traction as a way to accelerate innovation by
   bringing together a diverse group of interdisciplinary professionals
   from different industries who work collaboratively in teams and learn
   from each other, focus on a specific problem ({''}pain point{''}),
   develop a solution using design thinking techniques, pitch the solution
   to participants, gather fast feedback and quickly alter the prototype
   design ({''}pivoting{''}). 102 hackers including 19 (18.6 \%) physicians
   and other professionals participated, and over the course of 2 days
   worked in teams, pitched ideas and developed design prototypes. Three
   awards were given for prototypes that may improve function in persons
   with disabilities. 43 hackers were women (42.2 \%) and 59 men (57.8 \%);
   they ranged in age from 16 to 79 years old; and, of the 75 hackers who
   reported their age, 63 (84 \%) were less than 40 years old and 12 (16
   \%) were 40 years or older. This report contributes to the emerging
   literature on healthcare hackathons as a means of providing
   interdisciplinary education and training and supporting innovation.},

Title = {Consider ``HACKS{''} when designing hackathon challenges: Hook, action,
   collaborative knowledge sharing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {SEP 16},
Abstract = {Our world's complex challenges increase the need for those entering
   STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) disciplines to
   be able to creatively approach and collaboratively address wicked
   problems - complex problems with no ``right `` answer that span
   disciplines. Hackathons are environments that leverage problem-based
   learning practices so student teams can solve problems creatively and
   collaboratively by developing a solution to given challenges using
   engineering and computer science knowledge, skills, and abilities. The
   purpose of this paper is to offer a framework for interdisciplinary
   hackathon challenge development, as well as provide resources to aid
   interdisciplinary teams in better understanding the context and needs of
   a hackathon to evaluate and refine hackathon challenges. Three cohorts
   of interdisciplinary STEAM researchers were observed and interviewed as
   they collaboratively created a hackathon challenge incorporating all
   cohort-member disciplines for an online high school hackathon. The
   observation data and interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic
   analysis to distill the processes cohorts underwent and resources that
   were necessary for successfully creating a hackathon challenge. Through
   this research we found that the cohorts worked through four sequential
   stages as they collaborated to create a hackathon challenge. We detail
   the stages and offer them as a framework for future teams who seek to
   develop an interdisciplinary hackathon challenge. Additionally, we found
   that all cohorts lacked the knowledge and experience with hackathons to
   make fully informed decisions related to the challenge's topic, scope,
   outcomes, etc. In response, this manuscript offers five hackathon
   quality considerations and three guiding principles for challenge
   developers to best meet the needs and goals of hackathon sponsors and
   participants.},

Journal = {UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Nowadays, different technological solutions are already embedded into
   higher education: Web platforms, collaborative cloud environments,
   massive online courses, the flipped classroom, intelligence collective,
   etc. Besides, the current implementation of the European Higher
   Education Area has opened the doors to these new and revolutionary
   techniques and proposes a strategic action plan for 2019 derived from
   digital transformation, through the promotion of a collaborative
   European hackathon. Among these solutions, wikis are proved to match
   perfectly the requirements of the future learning framework 3.0 in which
   the student is the protagonist of his/her own education. Thus, many
   different universities around the world are nowadays supporting
   activities and events about the edition of wikis. In this work, we are
   interested in a special and universal wiki, Wikipedia. This encyclopedia
   is often used for student learning in high schools and university
   classrooms. However, today, there are few educational university
   projects dedicated to the editing of articles, and even fewer to the
   editing of scientific articles. There is no literature, to the knowledge
   of the authors that gathers both. Therefore, this work has a double
   objective, on the one hand, to highlight the international educational
   projects in which this great encyclopedia is edited and improved,
   especially by indicating the theme of the chosen edition, edition dates
   and achievements. On the other hand, once the action framework has been
   introduced, we show the specific educational project, which has been
   working with students from the first courses of the Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) since 2009 and promoted by one of the
   authors. Finally, and to go into more detail, the authors analyze a
   particular educational experience about the Wikipedia edition carried
   out at the UPM in 2017. The results show that editing Wikipedia produces
   a relevant improvement in the five proposed objectives.},

Abstract = {Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public
   engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity
   over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In
   this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited
   designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design
   Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their
   care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from
   designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in
   representing and involving peoplewith dementia in these events, which
   had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis
   presents insights into participants' motivations, challenges
   participants faced when constructing their ``absent user{''}, and the
   design features teams developed to address the social context of the
   user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for
   collaborative design events, community building through design, and
   reification in design.},

Abstract = {In order to support innovation, the Society of Imaging Informatics in
   Medicine (SIIM) elected to create a collaborative computing experience
   called a ``hackathon.{''} The SIIM Hackathon has always consisted of two
   components, the event itself and the infrastructure and resources
   provided to the participants. In 2014, SIIM provided a collection of
   servers to participants during the annual meeting. After initial server
   setup, it was clear that clinical and imaging ``test{''} data were also
   needed in order to create useful applications. We outline the goals,
   thought process, and execution behind the creation and maintenance of
   the clinical and imaging data used to create DICOM and FHIR Hackathon
   resources.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to check the effectiveness of differentiated
   English for Specific Purposes (ESP) instruction using the hackathon.
   This study used the mixed research method. The participants of the study
   were 24 Information Technology (IT) students of the Physics and
   Technology Institute of National Technical University of Ukraine ``Igor
   Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute{''} who voluntarily took part in the
   study in 2022-2023. They were divided into two experimental groups and
   differentiated according to the social roles and the level of English
   language proficiency. Sensory, interactive and graphic scaffolding as
   the temporary assistance was integrated in the educational process. As
   shown by the results of the experimental learning, the second group,
   where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of
   scaffolding use was defined by both students and teachers, demonstrated
   significantly better results than the first group, where the IT students
   performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was
   defined by IT students only. Scaffolding should be regulated by both the
   teacher and the students. It was concluded that the use of hackathon
   with a focus on learners' differentiation helps to diversify ESP
   learning at technical university and facilitates the development of
   professional communicative skills (speaking and writing) as well as
   other soft and hard skills.},

Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {Objective Medical students, as clinicians and healthcare leaders of the
   future, are key stakeholders in the clinical roll-out of artificial
   intelligence-driven technologies. The authors aim to provide the first
   report on the state of artificial intelligence in medical education
   globally by exploring the perspectives of medical students. Methods The
   authors carried out a mixed-methods study of focus groups and surveys
   with 128 medical students from 48 countries. The study explored
   knowledge around artificial intelligence as well as what students wished
   to learn about artificial intelligence and how they wished to learn
   this. A combined qualitative and quantitative analysis was used. Results
   Support for incorporating teaching on artificial intelligence into core
   curricula was ubiquitous across the globe, but few students had received
   teaching on artificial intelligence. Students showed knowledge on the
   applications of artificial intelligence in clinical medicine as well as
   on artificial intelligence ethics. They were interested in learning
   about clinical applications, algorithm development, coding and algorithm
   appraisal. Hackathon-style projects and multidisciplinary education
   involving computer science students were suggested for incorporation
   into the curriculum. Conclusions Medical students from all countries
   should be provided teaching on artificial intelligence as part of their
   curriculum to develop skills and knowledge around artificial
   intelligence to ensure a patient-centred digital future in medicine.
   This teaching should focus on the applications of artificial
   intelligence in clinical medicine. Students should also be given the
   opportunity to be involved in algorithm development. Students in low-
   and middle-income countries require the foundational technology as well
   as robust teaching on artificial intelligence to ensure that they can
   drive innovation in their healthcare settings.},

   Innovativeness During a Hackathon},

Abstract = {The transactive memory system has been studied extensively, yet we still
   know little about how it influences the effectiveness of temporary
   teams. Additionally, little is known about the boundary conditions of
   the well-established benefits of transactive memory systems on team
   performance. Our primary goal in this study is to build and test a
   theory that investigates the influence of a transactive memory system on
   the performance of temporary teams while accounting for conditional
   effects of both task and relationship conflict. On the surface, a
   transactive memory systems perspective may seem incompatible with
   temporary teams. Transactive memory systems typically require time or
   team member familiarity to develop. However, team members on temporary
   teams often are selected because of their expertise, not team member
   familiarity, and often must quickly and effectively operate under time
   and outcome pressures. We present a theory that suggests transactive
   memory systems should have a meaningful influence on temporary teams,
   and its effect is accentuated in the presence of task conflict and
   attenuated in the presence of relationship conflict. We test our theory
   using a sample of 202 teams participating in the Global Game Jam, the
   world's largest hackathon devoted to designing and developing games
   within a 48-h period. In addition to implications for literatures on
   transactive memory systems and temporary teams, our study adds to a
   growing literature providing practical advice and insight regarding
   hackathons, a pervasive source of innovation and idea generation.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the opportunities of leveraging a hackathon
   format to empower citizens by increasing their abilities to use open
   data to improve their neighbourhoods and communities. The presented
   discussion is grounded in five civic hackathon case studies organised in
   five European cities. The research revealed specialised learning and
   collaborative alignment as two mutually complementary aspects of the
   involved learning processes, which were achieved with the help of
   high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes, respectively. Consequently,
   the paper identifies and discusses three main factors required to
   sustain social learning ecosystems beyond hackathon events, and with the
   purpose of democratising smart city services. These factors include a)
   supporting individuals in obtaining specific expert knowledge and
   skills, b) nurturing data-literate activist communities of practice made
   up of citizens with complementary expert skillsets, and c) enabling
   members of these communities to generate prototypes of open-data
   services of varying fidelity.},

Abstract = {2021 Energy-Climate Hackathon
   What: Approximately 40 participants-with expertise spanning energy,
   computer science, and weather and climate research-joined a week-long
   Energy-Climate data ``hackathon{''} in a run-up to the 2021 UN COP26
   conference. Six projects to promote and grow data and science
   understanding were initiated and developed by teams over the course of
   the week, supported by access to state-of-the-art computational
   resources and stimulated by keynote speakers from industry and academia.
   The hackathon concluded with teams presenting their output to a panel of
   invited experts. The conference was initiated by University of Oxford
   Dr. Sarah Sparrow, Professor David Wallom, Professor Tim Woollings, and
   University of Reading Professor David Brayshaw, Dr. Hannah Bloomfield,
   in partnership with the Met Office, the United Kingdom's national
   meteorological service, and with support from the United Kingdom's
   CEDA-JASMIN service and Gurobi optimization software.
   When: 18 May (half-day ``scoping{''} event) and 21-25 June 2021 (main
   hackathon)

   Consortium convened a joint workshop at the University of Oxford, 27-29
   February 2012, with a small group of experts from Europe, USA, China and
   Japan, to continue the alignment of the Darwin Core with the MIxS and
   related genomics standards. Several reference mappings were produced as
   well as test expressions of MIxS in RDF. The use and management of
   controlled vocabulary terms was considered in relation to both GBIF and
   the GSC, and tools for working with terms were reviewed. Extensions for
   publishing genomic biodiversity data to the GBIF network via a Darwin
   Core Archive were prototyped and work begun on preparing translations of
   the Darwin Core to Japanese and Chinese. Five genomic repositories were
   identified for engagement to begin the process of testing the publishing
   of genomic data to the GBIF network commencing with the SILVA rRNA
   database.},

Title = {ITS plus DM Hackathon (ITSC 2017): Lane Departure Prediction With
   Naturalistic Driving Data},
Journal = {IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE},
Year = {2019},

Number = {4},

Abstract = {On October 16th, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan, from 8:00 to 18:00, the first
   Intelligent Transportation Systems plus Data Mining challenge was
   organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation
   Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent
   Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a
   three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and
   the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from
   eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving
   problem: Lane Departure detection.
   This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions
   submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting,
   but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning
   after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon
   formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of
   class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the
   provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the
   inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to
   expect outstanding results - the best one was only slightly over 3\%
   above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities
   pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking
   into consideration for example computer power load of the different
   algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to
   share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned
   lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of
   view.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning
   model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a ``hackathon,{''}
   to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a
   particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity
   students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to
   foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to
   introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a
   narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students
   participated in the workshop and completed pre-and post-surveys, and a
   free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in
   computing. Analysis revealed that students' motivation to learn about
   the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable
   technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following
   participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and
   outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in
   the computing word associations, with students associating computing
   more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as
   the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon
   event and a model for 21st-century learning can be effective in
   motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers
   in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and
   wearables.},

Title = {Emotion regulation in teamwork during a challenging hackathon:
   Comparison of best and worst teams},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 19},
Abstract = {Research has demonstrated the power of emotion regulation in managing
   challenges students face in different learning contexts. However,
   emotion research in team-learning where challenges become more evident
   is yet in its infancy. The current study examines case studies of two
   teams (high and low performing) in a hackathon where the task involved
   building a novel computer program to demonstrate a physics phenomenon;
   and explores how shared emotion regulation impacts teamwork and the
   types of challenges teams face (e.g., different goals/priorities;
   unreliable members; emotional imbalance; being off track, inefficient
   communication). Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze team
   interactions in terms of emotion regulation strategies student teams
   apply and the challenge types/levels they encounter. Comparative
   excerpts as well as descriptive statistics based on video data of
   student interactions, interview inputs, and responses to several
   questionnaires are provided to show differences among the cases. The
   team with higher shared emotional regulation mainly had external
   challenges that were less frustrating and demanding than relational
   challenges, while the team with lower shared regulation had internal
   challenges as well as external challenges and thus performed poorly. Our
   findings showed that when team members apply shared emotion regulation
   strategies, they build a cohesive atmosphere and synergistic team
   relationships that enable them to contribute to the overall team goals.
   This study also has implications for assisting educational teams in
   challenging environments. We hope that our paper will generate new ways
   of understanding and seeing shared emotion regulation in team settings.},

Title = {Fostering interdisciplinary working within global surgery at an
   undergraduate level: A hackathon based approach},
Journal = {SURGERY OPEN SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {26-31},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual hackathon in
   fostering interdisciplinary working amongst undergraduate students in
   global surgery.
   Methodology: In this study, we developed a 3 day event consisting of
   guest lectures, a documentary screening and a hackathon supported by
   academics and experts in the field, to provide students with the
   opportunity to learn more about and work in interdisciplinary teams
   within global surgery. Students had the option to attend just the
   lectures or both the lectures and hackathon. Quantitative and
   qualitative results were collected through a pre and post session
   survey.
   Results: A total of 21 responses were received for the hackathon and 26
   responses for the general event (response rate for event = 26 \%,
   response rate for hackathon = 24.7 \%). There was a significant
   improvement in understanding of interdisciplinary working in global
   surgery between the pre and post-session survey, with an increase in
   median from 3 (IQR = 2-3.5, n = 21) to 4 (IQR = 4-5, n = 21) (p < 0.05).
   Respondents noted that the benefits of a hackathon were that it was very
   engaging, and brought in diversity of thought and expertise. The
   drawbacks to the hackathon were that it was fast-paced, required prior
   knowledge and the virtual platform it was hosted on.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that hackathons are an effective,
   inclusive and equitable way for students to engage in and learn about
   interdisciplinary working. It is important that as institutions
   recognise and develop global surgery courses, these courses reflect the
   interdisciplinary nature of the field.},

Abstract = {Hackathon-style events are increasingly used to facilitate
   cross-disciplinary learning and innovation in the media industries.
   Based on an observational study of a hackathon organized as part of the
   film festival Nordic Panorama (NP) we analyse the challenges in using
   the hackathon format to facilitate cross-disciplinary learning and
   innovation for filmmakers, developers and designers. We find that many
   participants experienced frustrations resulting from a lack of
   programming skills and their expectation that the hackathon should
   result in something digital'. Additionally, ideals for authorship
   embedded in the working cultures of film and TV professionals impeded
   the team's ability to involve all participants on an equal footing. As
   implications for future hackathons we suggest organizers should consider
   using tools for end-user development and generative toolkits to
   facilitate digital making and collaborative learning. We also suggest
   similar events should avoid including project owners if the group work
   is based on existing projects.},

   tuberculosis (TB) burden estimates to support disease control efforts,

   solicit the development and comparison of several models for small area
   estimation of TB. The TB hackathon was launched in April 2019.
   Participating teams were requested to produce district-level estimates
   of bacteriologically positive TB prevalence among adults (over 15 years
   of age) for 2018. The NTP provided case-based data from their 2010-2011
   TB prevalence survey, along with data relating to TB screening, testing
   and treatment for the period between 2010-2011 and 2018. Five teams
   submitted district-level TB prevalence estimates, methodological details
   and programming code. Although the geographical distribution of TB
   prevalence varied considerably across models, we identified several
   districts with consistently low notification-to-prevalence ratios. The
   hackathon highlighted the challenges of generating granular
   spatiotemporal TB prevalence forecasts based on a cross-sectional
   prevalence survey data and other data sources. Nevertheless, it provided
   a range of approaches to subnational disease modelling. The NTP's use
   and plans for these outputs shows that, limitations notwithstanding,
   they can be valuable for programme planning.},

Abstract = {Stigma and prejudice are barriers to developing policies addressing
   homelessness. Awareness development, using civic hackathons, may be
   beneficial in reducing stigma and promoting policy while offering unique
   training to social work students. The current study explores the
   feasibility of hosting a university-based homelessness hackathon;
   associated changes in self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
   investment in addressing homelessness; and development of innovative
   solutions. Participants (N=32) attended a 7-hour event, involving expert
   panels, rapid iteration, and solution pitches. Pre- and postevent
   surveys demonstrate changes in knowledge and attitudes related to
   homelessness as well as civic responsibility. The event was less
   successful in generating deployable solutions. Findings suggest the
   benefit of university-based hackathons to train social work students and
   offer considerations for implementing hackathons in educational
   settings.},

Title = {Assessments of students' gains in conceptual understanding and technical
   skills after using authentic, online learning modules on hydrology and
   water resources},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {OCT 6},
Abstract = {The need to adapt quickly to online or remote instruction has been a
   challenge for instructors during the COVID pandemic. A common issue
   instructors face is finding high-quality curricular materials that can
   enhance student learning by engaging them in solving complex, real-world
   problems. The current study evaluates a set of 15 web-based learning
   modules that promote the use of authentic, high-cognitive demand tasks.
   The modules were developed collaboratively by a group of instructors
   during a HydroLearn hackathon-workshop program. The modules cover
   various topics in hydrology and water resources, including physical
   hydrology, hydraulics, climate change, groundwater flow and quality,
   fluid mechanics, open channel flow, remote sensing, frequency analysis,
   data science, and evapotranspiration. The study evaluates the impact of
   the modules on students' learning in terms of two primary aspects:
   understanding of fundamental concepts and improving technical skills.
   The study uses a practical instrument to measure students' perceived
   changes in concepts and technical skills known as the Student Assessment
   of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. The survey was used at two-time points
   in this study: before the students participated in the module (pre) and
   at the conclusion of the module (post). The surveys were modified to
   capture the concepts and skills aligned with the learning objectives of
   each module. We calculated the learning gains by examining differences
   in students' self-reported understanding of concepts and skills from
   pre- to post-implementation on the SALG using paired samples t-tests.
   The majority of the findings were statistically at the 0.05 level and
   practically significant. As measured by effect size, practical
   significance is a means for identifying the strength of the conclusions
   about a group of differences or the relationship between variables in a
   study. The average effect size in educational research is d = 0.4. The
   effect sizes from this study {[}0.45, 1.54] suggest that the modules
   play an important role in supporting students' gains in conceptual
   understanding and technical skills. The evidence from this study
   suggests that these learning modules can be a promising way to deliver
   complex subjects to students in a timely and effective manner.},

Title = {The Soundscape Hackathon as a Methodology to Accelerate Co-Creation of
   the Urban Public Space},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The design of urban public spaces is typically performed by architects
   and urban planners, which often only focus on the visual aesthetics of
   the urban space. Yet, a visually pleasing public open space designed for
   relaxing will be underused if it sounds unpleasant. Ideally, sonic
   design should be integrated with visual design, a need the soundscape
   approach answers. The current trend of co-creating the urban space
   together with all stakeholders, including local residents, opens up new
   opportunities to account for all senses in the urban design process.
   Unfortunately, architects and urban planners struggle to incorporate the
   soundscape approach in the urban design process and to use it in the
   context of co-creation. In this work, a hackathon is proposed to
   generate creative concepts, methods and tools to co-create the urban
   public space. A soundscape hackathon was organized in the spring of
   2019. Participants were challenged to apply their own immersive
   approaches or virtual and/or augmented reality solutions on selected
   urban soundscapes. They presented their results to colleagues in the
   field and to a professional jury. This paper describes the process and
   results of the event and shows that a hackathon is a viable approach to
   accelerate the co-creation of the urban public space.},

Title = {Perspectives on Great Lakes coastal management: A case study of the
   Point Pelee foreland, Canada},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {228},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coastal systems on the Laurentian Great Lakes are highly affected by
   meter scale variability in water levels that occur across a range of
   temporal scales, from hourly wind set-up and seiches to inter-annual
   highs and lows driven by longer-term patterns of precipitation and
   evaporation. High lake level periods are often associated with increased
   coastal erosion and flooding, stress on sensitive wetland ecosystems,
   and damage to infrastructure. During the late 2010s, water levels on the
   Great Lakes neared or exceeded record highs, initiating a renewed
   interest in coastal management across the region. The objective of this
   study was to inform and engage regional experts and local interest
   groups and to examine their perspectives on the important processes,
   coastal man-agement solutions, and applied research needed for the
   conservation of the Point Pelee (PP) foreland in Lake Erie. A virtual
   conference, the Point Pelee `Hackathon,' used a crowd-sourced approach
   to problem solving where participants were presented `the sum of the
   discourse,' or the current state of knowledge on coastal processes and
   management affecting the region. The conference covered a range of
   topics through invited speaker pre-sentations, followed by individual
   surveys and moderated group discussions. Q-methodology surveys
   incorpo-rated concepts informed by the sum of the discourse and
   identified statistically significant sources of agreement and
   disagreement on management challenges and solutions among `like-minded'
   individuals. Common view-points identified harbours \& jetties and
   sediment nourishment projects as an important cause of erosion and
   mitigation strategy, whereas highly opposed viewpoints were held on the
   importance of sediment supply and adopting a `do-nothing' approach for
   coastal management. Emergent and more nuanced viewpoints were also found
   within group discussions, highlighting important considerations that can
   be used to advance the discourse on proposed management solutions. The
   results of this study can be used to guide the development of a regional
   coastal management strategy, and a similar methodology can be used to
   inform and engage stakeholders and examine perspectives on a range of
   issues affecting the world's marine and lacustrine coasts.},

Title = {NCBI's Virus Discovery Hackathon: Engaging Research Communities to

Abstract = {A wealth of viral data sits untapped in publicly available metagenomic
   data sets when it might be extracted to create a usable index for the
   virological research community. We hypothesized that work of this
   complexity and scale could be done in a hackathon setting. Ten teams
   comprised of over 40 participants from six countries, assembled to
   create a crowd-sourced set of analysis and processing pipelines for a
   complex biological data set in a three-day event on the San Diego State
   University campus starting 9 January 2019. Prior to the hackathon,
   141,676 metagenomic data sets from the National Center for Biotechnology
   Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) were pre-assembled into
   contiguous assemblies (contigs) by NCBI staff. During the hackathon, a
   subset consisting of 2953 SRA data sets (approximately 55 million
   contigs) was selected, which were further filtered for a minimal length
   of 1 kb. This resulted in 4.2 million (Mio) contigs, which were aligned
   using BLAST against all known virus genomes, phylogenetically clustered
   and assigned metadata. Out of the 4.2 Mio contigs, 360,000 contigs were
   labeled with domains and an additional subset containing 4400 contigs
   was screened for virus or virus-like genes. The work yielded valuable
   insights into both SRA data and the cloud infrastructure required to
   support such efforts, revealing analysis bottlenecks and possible
   workarounds thereof. Mainly: (i) Conservative assemblies of SRA data
   improves initial analysis steps; (ii) existing bioinformatic software
   with weak multithreading/multicore support can be elevated by wrapper
   scripts to use all cores within a computing node; (iii) redesigning
   existing bioinformatic algorithms for a cloud infrastructure to
   facilitate its use for a wider audience; and (iv) a cloud infrastructure
   allows a diverse group of researchers to collaborate effectively. The
   scientific findings will be extended during a follow-up event. Here, we
   present the applied workflows, initial results, and lessons learned from
   the hackathon.},

   and Building Team Coordination Mechanisms During a Hackathon},

Abstract = {For effective teamwork, especially in demanding learning situations like
   a hackathon, coordination is crucial as it contributes to mutual trust
   and shared mental models of team members. However, teams experience
   challenges that mar team coordination. Research has shown that
   interpersonal skills such as socially-shared emotion regulation (SSER)
   can be key in dealing with such challenges. We examined the relationship
   between SSER and mutual trust, and SSER and shared mental models in the
   context of a hackathon. Adapted from a small SSER scale, we built a
   27-item questionnaire to examine SSER and its relationship with mutual
   trust and shared mental modelsin programming teams. We also used heat
   maps to provide an overview of individual team members' perceptions of
   their teams' SSER strategy application, mutual trust, and strength of
   shared mental model bonds within the team. Regarding the relationship
   between SSER and shared mental models, our analyses revealed
   signification association (correlation) between: (a) SSER situation
   modification and shared mental model: task and communication skills and
   (b) SSER situation modification and shared mental model: team dynamics
   and interaction. For the relationship between SSER and mutual trust, our
   analyses revealed significant relationships between: (a) SSER situation
   modification and perceived trustworthiness, (b) SSER cognitive change
   and perceived trustworthiness, (c) SSER response modulation and
   cooperative behaviors, and (d) SSER response modulation and monitoring
   behaviors. These relationships highlight the power of SSER in building
   key team coordination mechanisms and strengthening team performance.},

Abstract = {Background: Mapping out the research landscape around a project is often
   time consuming and difficult.
   Objective: This study evaluates a commercial artificial intelligence
   (AI) search engine (IRIS.AI ) for its applicability in an automated
   literature search on a specific medical topic.
   Methods: To evaluate the AI search engine in a standardized manner, the
   concept of a science hackathon was applied. Three groups of researchers
   were tasked with performing a literature search on a clearly defined
   scientific project. All participants had a high level of expertise for
   this specific field of research. Two groups were given access to the AI
   search engine IRIS.AI . All groups were given the same amount of time
   for their search and were instructed to document their results. Search
   results were summarized and ranked according to a predetermined scoring
   system.
   Results: The final scoring awarded 49 and 39 points out of 60 to AI
   groups 1 and 2, respectively, and the control group received 46 points.
   A total of 20 scientific studies with high relevance were identified,
   and 5 highly relevant studies ({''}spot on{''}) were reported by each
   group.
   Conclusions: AI technology is a promising approach to facilitate
   literature searches and the management of medical libraries. In this
   study, however, the application of AI technology lead to a more focused
   literature search without a significant improvement in the number of
   results.},

Abstract = {Drawing on three semi-structured focus group interviews with a sample of
   14 social hackathon participants in southern Estonia, this article
   reports the findings of participants' experiences of the co-creation
   process in developing new services or innovative solutions to community
   problems by using a method of social hackathon. In general, hackathon
   was perceived as a creative and `out-of-the-box' type of approach, a
   non-traditional way of thinking and an openness to constructing
   solutions in a new and creative way. Furthermore, the hackathon was
   recognised as a fitting tool for the social worker to find solutions in
   the community with service users.},

Abstract = {A hackathon is a social event that is focused on building small and
   innovative technology projects. The 2018 Hackathon hosted by the
   Washington State University (WSU) Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine
   aimed to solve rural health problems in Washington state. One major
   modification to the regular format of a healthcare hackathon was the
   inclusion of research librarians. Librarians with health sciences and
   business expertise provided research and library services at a
   designated Research Station, which included literature, patent, and
   internet searches. Participant and hackathon librarian observations,
   verbal feedback, and librarian survey results demonstrate the positive
   value/outcome of library services to the health hackathon winners. The
   winning hackathon teams used the services by the Research Station
   extensively. Areas of strength for this event included collaboration
   between librarians, promotion of library services, and efficient
   information retrieval. Areas for improvement included making regular
   contact with hackathon teams during the event and clearer signage and
   marketing.},

Title = {How We Do It: Creation of a Workforce Development-Focused Track at a
   Surgical Hackathon},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Healthcare hackathons are fast-paced, mentored events that
   bring together individuals with diverse skillsets to identify clinical
   needs and propose solutions. Traditionally geared toward device
   development and workflow optimization, platforms that address women and
   minorities in surgery are rare. We aimed to expand the traditional
   healthcare hackathon model to include a novel workforce development (WD)
   track to address concerns faced by surgeons and trainees.
   DESIGN: The WD track was created as part of the first surgical hackathon
   at our academic institution. In a single-day event, participants
   identified concerns (pain points) of diversity and sustainability in
   surgery, formed interdisciplinary teams, and pitched solutions. Pain
   points, project themes, and postevent survey results were analyzed and
   compared between WD and other tracks.
   SETTING: Participants were surveyed at Yale School of Medicine, an
   academic medical tertiary center, in September 2018.
   PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one total participants. Twentyfive (80.6\%)
   responded to the survey.
   RESULTS: Of 57 problem pitches, 23 (40.4\%) were related to WD. Issues
   highlighted 5 themes: training and career exploration, leadership and
   communication of skills, mental health and burnout prevention, surgeon
   discrimination and harassment, and work-life balance. Participants
   formed 6 groups, with 1 focused on WD. There was no difference between
   participants in the WD track and non-WD track counterparts with regard
   to excitement for continuing their project beyond the hackathon (4.00,
   standard deviation {[}SD] 0.89, vs. 3.63, SD 1.12, p = 0.43), and in
   their perception of the mentorship they received (4.00, SD 1.00, vs.
   4.11, SD 0.78, p = 0.84). The project presented within the WD track, on
   culturally sensitive scrub wear, was 1 of 3 prizewinners.
   CONCLUSIONS: The first WD track at a healthcare hackathon identified 5
   themes of unmet workforce needs. The pilot demonstrated that WD tracks
   can be implemented in hackathons with similar results to traditional
   tracks and create innovative and sustainable solutions to surgical
   workforce concerns. (C) 2020 Association of Program Directors in

Abstract = {How do people negotiate commitments to engaging in joint activity while
   at the same time anticipating and managing the inherent risks of
   collaboration? We explore this question through the ethnographic example
   of a hackathon, a collaborative software-design competition. We focus
   specifically on the earliest and, in many ways, most uncertain phase of
   collaboration, in which commitment and activity simultaneously emerge:
   team formation. We analyze mercurial allegiances in terms of a
   technoliberal participation ideology closely associated with the mores
   of the digital economy, which paradoxically emphasizes intensive
   project-based collaboration but limited interpersonal responsibility. We
   examine the verbal and nonverbal resources (such as stance-taking,
   politeness, reported speech, humor, and gesture) that prospective
   teammates use to modulate expressions of commitment, and the ways in
   which they pursue self-interested projects while maintaining social
   relatedness in order to accomplish joint activity in a context of social
   volatility.
   Comment les individus negocient-ils des engagements pour participer a
   une activite conjointe tout en anticipant et gerant les risques
   inherents a la collaboration? Nous etudions cette question a travers
   l'exemple ethnographique d'un << hackathon >>, un concours de
   programmation informatique collaborative. Nous nous concentrons
   particulierement sur la formation de l'equipe qui est la premiere phase
   de la collaboration, a bien des egards la plus incertaine, et d'oU
   l'engagement et l'activite emergent simultanement. Nous analysons les
   allegeances volatiles en termes d'une ideologie de la participation
   etroitement liee aux mOEurs de l'economie numerique, ces solidarites
   temporaires soulignent paradoxalement une collaboration a forte
   intensite mais une responsabilite interpersonnelle limitee. Nous
   examinons les ressources verbales et non-verbales (telles que la prise
   de position, la politesse, le discours rapporte, l'humour, et la
   gestuelle) utilisees par des coequipiers potentiels pour moduler les
   expressions d'engagement ainsi que les facons dont ils poursuivent des
   interets personnels tout en maintenant des rapports sociaux, ceci dans
   le but d'accomplir une activite conjointe dans un contexte de volatilite

Abstract = {The detailed understanding of tsunami hazard risk using numerical
   simulations requires a numerical model that can accurately predict
   tsunami inundation phenomena on land. In such models, the structural
   effects are indirectly considered using the variation of bottom
   roughness as a proxy for the differences in building densities. Only a
   few studies have conducted inter-model tests to investigate tsunami
   inundation in complex coastal urban cities. During the tsunami analysis
   hackathon held in September 2020, eight research groups met to have a
   detailed discussion on the current urban inundation problems. In this
   study, we conducted an intermodel comparison of the numerical tsunami
   models, using the data from physical experiments that were performed on
   a detailed urban model. Our objective was to investigate the necessary
   conditions of an accurate numerical model based that can ensure high
   reproducibility and practicality. It was confirmed that the accuracy of
   topographic data is an important parameter for tsunami inundation
   simulations in complex urban areas. Based on the computational cost and
   accuracy, we suggest that a resolution of 1 cm of topographic data is a
   sufficient condition for tsunami inundation simulations on 1/250 scale
   model.},

   to address the challenge of adapting the Darwin Core standard for a wide
   variety of sample data. Topics addressed in the workshop included 1) a
   review of outstanding issues in the Darwin Core standard, 2) issues
   relating to publishing of biodiversity data through Darwin Core
   Archives, 3) use of Darwin Core Archives for publishing sample and
   monitoring data, 4) the case for modifying the Darwin Core Text Guide
   specification to support many-to-many relations, and 5) the
   generalization of the Darwin Core Archive to a ``Biodiversity Data
   Archive{''}. A wide variety of use cases were assembled and discussed in
   order to inform further developments.},

Abstract = {Objective: This study was intended to demonstrate the applicability of
   the hackathon in idea generation for managing emergencies and disasters
   with a particular focus on flash floods. Methods: A 4-day hackathon
   event was held, having 60 students, 9 mentors and 6 judges gathered to
   explore different ideas, and to solve problems of Iran flooding from
   mid-March to April, 2019. Of these, 10 teams with 6 students were
   accordingly formed to brainstorm and discuss the idea, while 9 mentors
   offered advice and guided them to manage their ideas. Then, all teams
   focused on designing their business models. Finally, the hackathon teams
   finalized their lean canvas and presented their ideas to the judging
   panel and the other participants. Results: A total of 10 ideas were
   presented, and based on the knowledge and experience of the judges, 3
   ideas that were more practical and useful were selected. Conclusions: As
   participants in a hackathon identify and present real-world problems,
   while ensuring that the prototype solutions address the end-user's
   needs, it could be used to drive innovation, generate ideas, promote
   change in emergencies and disasters, and can increase our preparedness
   for future events. It helps us to develop tools and applications to
   better respond to these events.},

Title = {Community-engaged mHealth intervention to increase uptake of HIV
   pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among gay, bisexual and other men who
   have sex with men in China: study protocol for a pilot randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},

Abstract = {Introduction The large number of key populations in China who would
   benefit from HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the context of
   limited health system capacity and public awareness will pose challenges
   for timely PrEP scale-up, suggesting an urgent need for innovative and
   accessible interventions. This study aims to develop and pilot test a
   theory-informed, tailored mobile phone intervention that was codeveloped
   by young gay men, HIV clinicians and public health researchers to
   increase engagement in PrEP education and initiation among Chinese gay,
   bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM), who bear a
   disproportionate burden of HIV infections and remain underserved in the
   healthcare system.
   Methods and analysis This two-phase study includes a formative
   assessment using in-depth interviews (N=30) and a 12-week experimental
   pilot study using a two-arm randomised controlled trial design (N=70).
   The primary intervention is delivered through a WeChat-based mini-app (a
   program built into a Chinese multipurpose social media application)
   developed by young GBMSM from a 2019 crowdsourcing hackathon. Using
   mixed methods, we will further investigate the specific needs and
   concerns among GBMSM in terms of using PrEP as an HIV prevention
   strategy, how their concerns and PrEP use behaviours may change with
   exposure to the mini-app intervention during the study period and how we
   can further refine this intervention tool to better meet GBMSM's needs
   for broader implementation.
   Ethics and dissemination This study and its protocols have been reviewed
   and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of
   North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA (19-3481), the Guangdong Provincial
   Dermatology Hospital, China (2020031) and the Guangzhou Eighth People's
   Hospital, China (202022155). Study staff will work with local GBMSM
   community-based organisations to disseminate the study results to
   participants and the community via social media, workshops and journal
   publications.},

Abstract = {Participation in research in beneficial but can be challenging at a
   participant, clinician and organisation level. A novel online
   recruitment and data collection platform has been designed to improve
   accessibility to research and reduce the burden for participants and
   centres. The pilot study has demonstrated the platform to be feasible,
   acceptable to patients and accurate. Useful template when resources
   limited.
   Background Participation in research can be beneficial for patients and
   healthcare providers, but may prove demanding at patient, clinician and
   organizational levels. Patient representatives are supportive of online
   research to overcome these challenges. The aim of this pilot study was
   to develop an online recruitment platform and test its feasibility and
   acceptability while evaluating the accuracy of participant-reported
   data.
   Methods The online research platform was developed in a 1-day
   `hackathon' with a digital design company. Women who underwent
   implant-based breast reconstruction in 2011-2016 were invited by letter
   containing the web address (URL) of the study site and their unique
   study number. Once online, participants learned about the study,
   consented, entered data on demographics, treatment received and
   patient-reported outcome measures (BREAST-Q (TM)), and booked an
   appointment for a single hospital visit for three-dimensional surface
   imaging (3D-SI). Real-time process evaluation was performed. The primary
   endpoint was recruitment rate.
   Results The recruitment rate was 40 per cent. Of the 100 women, 50
   logged on to the platform and 40 completed the process through to 3D-SI.
   The majority of discontinuations after logging on occurred between
   consenting and entering demographics (3 women, 6 per cent), and between
   completing the BREAST-Q and booking an appointment for 3D-SI using the
   online calendar (3 women, 6 per cent). All women completed the online
   BREAST-Q (TM) once started. Participants took a median of 23 minutes to
   complete the online process. Patient-reported clinical data were
   accurate in 12 of 13 domains compared with electronic records (95 per
   cent concordance). Process evaluation demonstrated acceptability.
   Conclusion The results of this pilot demonstrate the online platform to
   be acceptable, feasible, and accurate for this population from a single
   institution. The low-burden design may enable participation from centres
   with less research support and participants from hard-to-reach groups or
   dispersed geographical locations, but with online access.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this manuscript is to report our experience in the 2021
   SIIM Virtual Hackathon, where we developed a proof-of-concept of a
   radiology training module with elements of gamification. In the 50 h
   allotted in the hackathon, we proposed an idea, connected with
   colleagues from five different countries, and completed an operational
   proof-of-concept, which was demonstrated live at the hackathon showcase,
   competing with eight other teams. Our prototype involved participants
   annotating publicly available chest radiographs of patients with
   tuberculosis. We showed how we could give experience points to trainees
   based on annotation precision compared to ground truth radiologists'
   annotation, ranked in a live leaderboard. We believe that gamification
   elements could provide an engaging solution for radiology education. Our
   project was awarded first place out of eight participating hackathon
   teams.},

Abstract = {This article assesses the experience with i-Log at the European Big Data
   Hackathon 2019, a satellite event of the New Techniques and Technologies
   for Statistics (NTTS) conference, organised by Eurostat. i-Log is a
   system that enables capturing personal big data from smartphones'
   internal sensors to be used for time use measurement. It allows the
   collection of heterogeneous types of data, enabling new possibilities
   for sociological urban field studies. Sensor data such as those related
   to the location or the movements of the user can be used to investigate
   and gain insights into the time diaries' answers and assess their
   overall quality. The key idea is that the users' answers are used to
   train machine-learning algorithms, allowing the system to learn from the
   user's habits and to generate new time diaries' answers. In turn, these
   new labels can be used to assess the quality of existing ones, or to
   fill the gaps when the user does not provide an answer. The aim of this
   paper is to introduce the pilot study, the i-Log system and the
   methodological evidence that emerged during the survey.},

Title = {An investigation of the features facilitating effective collaboration
   between public health experts and data scientists at a hackathon},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH},

Abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study is to explore facilitating
   factors for collaboration at hackathons, intensive events bringing
   together data scientists ('hackers') with experts in particular subject
   areas.
   Study design: This is a qualitative study.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with organisers before
   and after the event. The initial exploratory interviews influenced the
   content of questionnaires which were distributed to all participants
   asking about their motivations and experiences. Thematic analysis was
   used to explore key features of collaboration.
   Results: Facilitating factors were clustered under the themes of
   preparation (the right amount of pre-event information, methods to
   maximise attendance and identification of suitable challenges),
   participants (enough people to progress and a mixture of skills and
   experience), working together (mutual understanding of the aim, getting
   the best out of each other, overcoming challenges together, effective
   facilitation and an enjoyable and valuable experience) and follow-up
   (recognised process for feedback and support for the development of
   prototypes).
   Conclusions: The findings of the study provide insight into fostering
   collaboration in this context and provide evidence that may be used to
   tailor future events for the effective delivery of technological and
   marketing-based solutions to public health challenges. Hackathons
   provide a methodological advance with potential for broad public health
   application. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by

Title = {Learning sustainable work through critical design: a case study of a
   hackathon to prepare the future workforce},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Pages = {641-651},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to explore the future of work by investigating how work
   can be practiced to meet global sustainability goals. The authors draw
   from empirical findings from a case of critical design session with
   university students. The aim of the design session was, on the one hand,
   to embed sustainability into education and, on the other hand, to
   prepare students with necessary conceptual tools to be prepared for
   future work. The research questions explored are: What do students learn
   through engagement in critical design, and how can that foster
   sustainable work?
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research approach is a case study, drawing on critical design
   activities with 45 students at a university course. The data consists of
   students' reflections on their design efforts and one researcher's field
   notes from the design session.
   Findings
   The findings show that the students engaged in critical design learn
   different aspects of sustainable work: how to be solution oriented, how
   to use technology to do good in the world and outside-the-box thinking
   skills.
   Originality/value
   The authors contribute extended insight into what it means to work for
   sustainable development, hence doing sustainable work, and how
   sustainable work can be conducted in practice. The authors discuss three
   dimensions of sustainable work that we argue are essential to understand
   how professionals can work towards increased sustainability. The three
   dimensions are: participation-based work, practice-based work and
   context-based work.},

Abstract = {Despite originating in the tech industry, hackathons have now been
   adopted in a variety of domains. However, little is known about the
   status of hackathon literature within educational research. As the
   number of studies grows, it is essential to develop an understanding of
   the current state and identify prevalent topics and trends shaping the
   literature. Toward this goal, this study conducted a bibliometric
   analysis and scoping review on hackathon research in the field of
   education. A total of 249 documents written by 1,309 authors and
   published in 180 unique sources for the period 2014-2022 were
   identified. Collectively, the dataset amassed 1,312 citations with an
   average of 6.69 citations per document. The most prevalent subject areas
   were computer science, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and
   business. Word frequency analysis showed that ``innovation{''} was the
   most occurring word, which represents the fundamental objective of
   hackathon events. The most influential work was the analysis of
   hackathons as an informal learning platform. Engineering education was
   the most trending topic while healthcare is an emerging research
   cluster. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the
   hackathon literature and its research landscape in an educational
   setting.},

Abstract = {Background The new concept of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis
   (D2T RA) refers to RA patients who remain symptomatic after several
   lines of treatment, resulting in a high patient and economic burden.
   During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in
   structured and unstructured routine care data. Methods Routine care data
   of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented
   Database. Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA
   patients were clinically classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as
   a validation set. Machine learning techniques, text mining, and feature
   importance analyses were performed to identify and predict D2T RA
   patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data. Results
   We identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA
   definition in structured and unstructured routine care data.
   Additionally, we developed a D2T RA identification model derived from a
   feature importance analysis of all available structured data (AUC-ROC
   0.88 (95\% CI 0.82-0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential of
   longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA
   patients using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to
   the time of starting the first biological treatment, we predicted future
   development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71-0.75)). Conclusions
   During this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different
   techniques for the identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in
   structured as well as unstructured routine care data. The results are
   promising and should be optimized and validated in future research.},

Abstract = {Hackathons are intense, short, collaborative events focusing on solving
   real world problems through interdisciplinary teams. This is a report of
   the mHealth hackathon hosted by Khon Kaen University in collaboration
   with MIT Sana and faculty members from Harvard Medical School with the
   aim to improve health care delivery in the Northeast region of Thailand.
   Key health challenges, such as improving population health literacy,
   tracking disease trajectory and outcomes among rural communities, and
   supporting the workflow of overburdened frontline providers, were
   addressed using mHealth. Many modifications from the usual format of
   hackathon were made to tailor the event to the local context and
   culture, such as the process of recruiting participants and how teams
   were matched and formed. These modifications serve as good learning
   points for hosting future hackathons. There are also many lessons
   learned about how to achieve a fruitful collaboration despite cultural
   barriers, how to best provide mentorship to the participants, how to
   instill in the participants a sense of mission, and how to match the
   participants in a fair and efficient manner. This event showcases how
   interdisciplinary collaboration can produce results that are
   unattainable by any discipline alone and demonstrates that innovations
   are the fruits of collective wisdom of people from different fields of
   expertise who work together toward the same goals.},

Abstract = {Background: Interdisciplinary approaches are needed to address complex
   societal problems, such as the opioid crisis. We sought to explore the
   feasibility and potential issues encountered in planning and
   implementing a 24-hour hackathon competition to bring together teams
   from law enforcement, public health, and data science to develop
   solutions to the opioid epidemic. Methods: We enlisted an advisory board
   and planning committee, including key stakeholders (e.g., high-level
   representatives from government agencies) to plan the event. Teams
   completed an online registration form with questions about team
   composition. Each team captain completed a survey at the event
   describing prior experiences with their team, knowledge and interest
   around the opioid epidemic, and hackathon expectations. Results:
   Twenty-nine teams (108 individuals) registered. Seventy-six percent had
   a technical/engineering background. Participants were from industry
   (55\%), academia (30\%), public health/medicine (9\%), and
   government/public policy (6\%). Nineteen teams attended the event. Team
   captains were primarily 18-29 years of age, had moderate experience and
   interest in the opioid crisis, and had never attended an opioid-related
   event. Conclusions: It is feasible to implement a 24-hour opioid-focused
   hackathon and recruit teams/participants from a broad range of
   disciplines. We discuss the solutions developed, barriers encountered,
   and insights gained throughout the planning and implementation process.},

Title = {Open innovation in the face of the COVID-19 grand challenge: insights
   from the Pan-European hackathon `EUvsVirus'},

Abstract = {Being a grand challenge of global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic requires
   collective and collaborative efforts from a variety of actors to enable
   the expected scientific advancement and technological progress. To
   achieve such an open innovation approach, several initiatives have been
   launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources
   that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular
   tool that has gained some momentum during COVID-19 times is hackathons,
   which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals
   who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time,
   with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and
   analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European
   Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3-day online hackathon to connect
   civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and
   beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus-related
   challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as
   a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective open innovation in the
   face of COVID-19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online
   setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can
   play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as
   in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, both urgent action and long-term
   thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the
   `usual suspects', through knowledge recombination with atypical
   resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general
   public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on open
   innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational
   boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level.},

Title = {A Systems Engineering Hackathon - A Methodology Involving Multiple
   Stakeholders to Progress Conceptual Design of a Complex Engineered

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process
   and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and
   development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in
   this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a
   diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision
   criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and
   communication of information across traditional engineering and
   operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is
   highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where
   stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members
   were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a
   hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured
   around the technical functions within an engineering company has the
   capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale
   for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon
   method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better
   manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall
   design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it
   can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80\%
   reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with
   using current/regular internal methods.},

Abstract = {Background Hackathons are a popular trend in the technology domain and
   is considered a powerful tool to spur creativity and innovation. In a
   health hackathon, an interdisciplinary team of health, technology and
   management experts work collaboratively to solve a common problem.
   Health hackathon can be one of the quickest means to derive technology
   or process-based solutions to the challenges faced by clinicians.
   Methods A 2-day hackathon: Hacking Cancer was conducted at a tertiary
   cancer centre in India to develop quick, cost-effective solutions in
   cancer care. Twelve oncology-related problem statements were explored.
   Undergraduate and postgraduate students of health and dental sciences,
   pharmacy, nursing, engineering and business management were the
   participants.
   Outcomes One hundred and fifty-seven participants expressed interest,
   and 90 participated in the event. The participants did a time-bound
   exploration of 12 challenges in oncology elucidated problem statements.
   The oncology specialists mentored the participants during the hackathon.
   Seventeen teams presented their solutions. Judges reviewed the solutions
   and scored the teams based on feasibility, relevance and applicability.
   The top-scoring three projects were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
   better-improving adherence to treatment in ALL patients, Donate
   Life-application for voluntary blood donation and Lumiflex-a novel
   illuminated flexible abdominal retractor. They received seed funding to
   develop prototypes and implement their ideas.
   Conclusion Hacking Cancer was an effective way of developing quick,
   cost-effective solutions to the common problems faced in cancer care.
   The pool of local participants developed solutions that were relevant
   and applicable to the practice setting. This one was the first oncology
   themed hackathon in the country.},

Title = {Creating and curating a community of practice: introducing the evidence
   synthesis Hackathon and a special series in evidence synthesis
   technology},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 19},
Abstract = {Evidence synthesis is a vital part of evidence-informed decision-making,
   but high growth in the volume of research evidence over recent decades
   has made efficient evidence synthesis increasingly challenging. As the
   appreciation and need for timely and rigorous evidence synthesis
   continue to grow, so too will the need for tools and frameworks to
   conduct reviews of expanding evidence bases in an efficient and
   time-sensitive manner. Efforts to future-proof evidence synthesis
   through the development of new evidence synthesis technology (ESTech)
   have so far been isolated across interested individuals or groups, with
   no concerted effort to collaborate or build communities of practice in
   technology production. We established the evidence synthesis Hackathon
   to stimulate collaboration and the production of Free and Open Source
   Software and frameworks to support evidence synthesis. Here, we
   introduce a special series of papers on ESTech, and invite the readers
   of environmental evidence to submit manuscripts introducing and
   validating novel tools and frameworks. We hope this collection will help
   to consolidate ESTech development efforts and we encourage readers to
   join the ESTech revolution. In order to future-proof evidence synthesis
   against the evidence avalanche, we must support community enthusiasm for
   ESTech, reduce redundancy in tool design, collaborate and share capacity
   in tool production, and reduce inequalities in software accessibility.},

Title = {14 examples of how LLMs can transform materials science and chemistry: a
   reflection on a large language model hackathon},
Journal = {DIGITAL DISCOVERY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1233-1250},
Month = {OCT 9},
Abstract = {Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many
   scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful
   in chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we
   organized a hackathon. This article chronicles the projects built as
   part of this hackathon. Participants employed LLMs for various
   applications, including predicting properties of molecules and
   materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge
   from unstructured data, and developing new educational applications. The
   diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated
   in less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the
   future of our fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also
   indicates that the applications of LLMs are not limited to materials
   science and chemistry but offer potential benefits to a wide range of
   scientific disciplines.
   We report the findings of a hackathon focused on exploring the diverse
   applications of large language models in molecular and materials
   science.},

Abstract = {Open science and collaboration are necessary to facilitate the
   advancement of Parkinson's disease (PD) research. Hackathons are
   collaborative events that bring together people with different skill
   sets and backgrounds to generate resources and creative solutions to
   problems. These events can be used as training and networking
   opportunities, thus we coordinated a virtual 3-day hackathon event,
   during which 49 early-career scientists from 12 countries built tools
   and pipelines with a focus on PD. Resources were created with the goal
   of helping scientists accelerate their own research by having access to
   the necessary code and tools. Each team was allocated one of nine
   different projects, each with a different goal. These included
   developing post-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analysis
   pipelines, downstream analysis of genetic variation pipelines, and
   various visualization tools. Hackathons are a valuable approach to
   inspire creative thinking, supplement training in data science, and
   foster collaborative scientific relationships, which are foundational
   practices for early-career researchers. The resources generated can be
   used to accelerate research on the genetics of PD.},

Abstract = {A hackathon is best described as an `innovation marathon'. Derived from
   the words `hacking' and `marathon', it brings together multidisciplinary
   teams to collaborate intensely over a short period of time to define a
   problem, devise a solution, and design a working prototype.
   International scientific meetings are conducive to successful
   hackathons, providing an audience of expert professionals who describe
   challenges and ensure the proposed solutions address end-user needs.
   Collaborations with local organizations and academic centers are crucial
   to attracting complementary specialties such as IT advisors, engineers,
   and entrepreneurs to develop sustainable projects. The core process of
   first identifying and deconstructing a problem followed by solution
   iteration is applicable to challenges at workplaces around the world.
   Ultimately, this model can be used to drive innovation and catalyze
   change in the global health community. The planning, execution, and
   outcomes of a hackathon event organized in conjunction with the
   International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED 2016)
   are described in this article. Physicians, public health practitioners,
   veterinarians, IT professionals, engineers, and entrepreneurs came
   together for 2 days to develop solutions at the intersection of emerging
   infectious diseases and climate change. Projects that resulted from the
   IMED 2016 Hackathon included environmental impact assessment software
   for humanitarian organization relief efforts; enhanced communication
   tools to prevent disease outbreaks; a participatory mobile application
   to speed the elimination of rabies in Indonesia; integrated disease
   surveillance platforms; and an improved search function for infectious
   disease outbreak reports in the ProMED-mail network. (C) 2017 The

Title = {Youth social innovation during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines:
   a quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses from a crowdsourcing
   open call and online hackathon},
Journal = {BMJ INNOVATIONS},

Abstract = {Introduction Young people have played a pivotal role as part of the
   COVID-19 response, including developing health messages and social
   innovations. Social innovation in health engages multiple stakeholders
   in linking social change and health improvement. The study examined the
   feasibility of youth ideas and innovations to address the impacts of the
   COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative descriptive
   analyses.
   Methods In partnership with the WHO, academic institutions, youth
   organisations and civil society groups, we conducted a crowdsourcing
   open call among Filipino youth (15-30 years old) using a structured
   Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases/Social
   Innovation in Health Initiative process. The open call had three
   categories: youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID-19 world (entries
   were texts, images, videos and music), youth-led COVID-19 social
   innovations, and youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19.
   Each submission was evaluated by three independent judges. Finalists
   were selected in each of the categories alongside four grand winners.
   All finalists were invited to attend a 1day online civic hackathon.
   Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the
   post-COVID world=76; youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17; youth-led
   social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused
   on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon
   provided the participants mentorship for further development of their
   ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication
   campaigns and improved social innovations.
   Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response
   to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth
   voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation
   call is recommended.},

Title = {A Men Who Have Sex With Men-Friendly Doctor Finder Hackathon in
   Guangzhou, China: Development of a Mobile Health Intervention to Enhance
   Health Care Utilization},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHeath)-based HIV and sexual health promotion
   among men who have sex with men (MSM) is feasible in low- and
   middle-income settings. However, many currently available mHealth tools
   on the market were developed by the private sector for profit and have
   limited input from MSM communities.
   Objective: A health hackathon is an intensive contest that brings
   together participants from multidisciplinary backgrounds to develop a
   proposed solution for a specific health issue within a short period. The
   purpose of this paper was to describe a hackathon event that aimed to
   develop an mHealth tool to enhance health care (specifically HIV
   prevention) utilization among Chinese MSM, summarize characteristics of
   the final prototypes, and discuss implications for future mHealth
   intervention development.
   Methods: The hackathon took place in Guangzhou, China. An open call for
   hackathon participants was advertised on 3 Chinese social media
   platforms, including Blued, a popular social networking app among MSM.
   All applicants completed a Web-based survey and were then scored. The
   top scoring applicants were grouped into teams based on their skills and
   content area expertise. Each team was allowed 1 month to prepare for the
   hackathon. The teams then came together in person with on-site expert
   mentorship for a 72-hour hackathon contest to develop and present
   mHealth prototype solutions. The judging panel included experts in
   psychology, public health, computer science, social media, clinical
   medicine, and MSM advocacy. The final prototypes were evaluated based on
   innovation, usability, and feasibility.
   Results: We received 92 applicants, and 38 of them were selected to
   attend the April 2019 hackathon. A total of 8 teams were formed,
   including expertise in computer science, user interface design, business
   or marketing, clinical medicine, and public health. Moreover, 24
   participants self-identified as gay, and 3 participants self-identified
   as bisexual. All teams successfully developed a prototype tool. A total
   of 4 prototypes were designed as a mini program that could be embedded
   within a popular Chinese social networking app, and 3 prototypes were
   designed as stand-alone apps. Common prototype functions included
   Web-based physician searching based on one's location (8 prototypes),
   health education (4 prototypes), Web-based health counseling with
   providers or lay health volunteers (6 prototypes), appointment
   scheduling (8 prototypes), and between-user communication (2
   prototypes). All prototypes included strategies to ensure privacy
   protection for MSM users, and some prototypes offered strategies to
   ensure privacy of physicians. The selected prototypes are undergoing
   pilot testing.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability
   of using a hackathon to create mHealth intervention tools. This suggests
   a different pathway to developing mHealth interventions and could be
   relevant in other settings.},

Abstract = {This special communication describes activities, products, and lessons
   learned from a recent hackathon that was funded by the National Center
   for Advancing Translational Sciences via the Biomedical Data Translator
   program (`Translator'). Specifically, Translator team members
   self-organized and worked together to conceptualize and execute, over a
   five-day period, a multi-institutional clinical research study that
   aimed to examine, using open clinical data sources, relationships
   between sex, obesity, diabetes, and exposure to airborne fine
   particulate matter among patients with severe asthma. The goal was to
   develop a proof of concept that this new model of collaboration and data
   sharing could effectively produce meaningful scientific results and
   generate new scientific hypotheses. Three Translator Clinical Knowledge
   Sources, each of which provides open access (via Application Programming
   Interfaces) to data derived from the electronic health record systems of
   major academic institutions, served as the source of study data. Jupyter
   Python notebooks, shared in GitHub repositories, were used to call the
   knowledge sources and analyze and integrate the results. The results
   replicated established or suspected relationships between sex, obesity,
   diabetes, exposure to airborne fine particulate matter, and severe
   asthma. In addition, the results demonstrated specific differences
   across the three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, suggesting
   cohort- and/or environment-specific factors related to the services
   themselves or the catchment area from which each service derives patient
   data. Collectively, this special communication demonstrates the power
   and utility of intense, team-oriented hackathons and offers general
   technical, organizational, and scientific lessons learned.},
