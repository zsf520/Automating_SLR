article,Toward a Framework for Teaching Artificial Intelligence to a Higher Education Audience,"Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science [84]. The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article shares the insights from both students and lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in teaching and learning of these topics.","Allen, Becky and McGough, Andrew Stephen and Devlin, Marie","self-efficacy, Artificial intelligence, pedagogy",10.1145/3485062,2021,29
inproceedings,Improving Higher Education: Learning Analytics &amp; Recommender Systems Research,"An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. Studies in the U.S. report that average six-year graduation rates across higher-education institutions is 59% and have remained relatively stable over the last 15 years. For those that do complete a college degree, less than half complete within four-years. Requiring additional terms or leaving college without receiving a bachelor's degree has high human and monetary costs and deprives students from the economic benefits of a college credential (over $1 million in a lifetime and even higher in STEM fields). Moreover, when students do not succeed in graduating, local and national communities struggle to create an educated workforce. Estimates indicate that by 2020 over 64% of the jobs in the U.S. will require at least some post-secondary education. These challenges have been recognized by the U.S. National Research Council, which identified that there is a critical need to develop innovative approaches to enable higher-education institutions retain students, ensure their timely graduation, and are well-trained and workforce ready in their field of study. Failure to do so represents a significant problem as it deprives the U.S. of the highly skilled workforce that it needs to successfully compete in the modern world.This talk describes various efforts under way to develop ""Big Data"" methods to analyze in a comprehensive manner, the large and diverse types of education and learning-related data in order to improve undergraduate education. These methods are motivated by and are designed to address various interrelated issues that have a significant impact on college student success and include: (i) academic pathways towards successful and timely graduation from the student perspective; (ii) effective pedagogy by instructors; and (iii) retention and persistence of students from the institutional and advisor perspective. In addition, the talk will discuss areas in which research methods and approaches originally developed by the recommender systems community can be applied to this domain.","Karypis, George","student modeling, educational data mining, learning analytics",10.1145/3109859.3109870,2017,1
inproceedings,Psychology in Higher Education,"In recent years, with the vigorous development of China's economy, society and culture, ideological and political education and mental health education in colleges and universities are facing new challenges. Simple ideological and political education is no longer suitable for the development of young people. In the reality of education, due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of ideological and political work, and do not have the relevant psychological knowledge, many educators treat all problems, especially psychological problems as ideological and political problems, which will have a negative impact on the growth of young people. Therefore, we need to strengthen the effectiveness of ideological and political education, make ideological and political education more scientific, predictable and targeted. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of psychology in higher education. This paper first expounds the concept of psychology, and then introduces the application value of psychology in college education and teaching. This paper takes teachers from four colleges and universities in Sichuan province as the research object, uses questionnaire survey method, and makes statistics on 178 questionnaires. The analysis results show that 62% of the teachers realize the importance of psychology to education work.","Liu, Ruifeng and Wu, Min",,10.1145/3456887.3457003,2021,4

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges for the Public Sector,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which ""intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity"" [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.","Susar, Deniz and Aquaro, Vincenzo","E-government, Public Sector, Digital Government, Artificial Intelligence, Public Administration, Sustainable Development Goals",10.1145/3326365.3326420,2019,9
article,"Artificial Intelligence: The Societal Responsibility to Inform, Educate, and Regulate","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field; one that is mysterious to the general public. The mention of the word AI fills the imaginations of many with thoughts of talking robots, jobs being replaced, and possibly even the destruction of mankind. Perhaps imaginations are running wild due to, perhaps driven by the loose definition of AI as systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence that allows Hollywood to take some creative license. The experts in the field tend to work directly with AI and often for large companies, allowing for the imagination and news headlines to be where the public gets their information. Many wonder if this new technology is going to be an overall benefit to society or if it will bring unmitigated disaster. When the imagination runs wild, instead of understanding, news stories can perpetuate concerns and anxieties rather than hope and optimism.","Hilton, Alexander D.",,10.1145/3362077.3362088,2019,7
inproceedings,Simulation for Higher Education Sustainability: A Growing Institution Case Study,"We propose to reduce the complexity of sustainable development when we apply the simulation paradigm to a higher education institution by using a decomposition of both sustainability and the institution. It opens the possibilities to formalize their partial components and to identify many meaningful relationships among them. We formalized such relationships as a set of specific processes that we used in the created simulation case study. We consider the simulation models created within the case study as a tool to support higher education institution sustainability. In the simulation case study, we analyzed the faculty-students relationship described by the related institution admission processes. The simulation case study is connected with economic-constituent relations sustainability metrics. The simulation case study has been applied at a young fast growing higher education institution in the United States.","Kurkovsky, Anatoly","simulation case study, higher education, sustainable development",,2017,10

inproceedings,Introducing Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals with LearningML: Artificial Intelligence Made Easy,"This paper is a summary of the webinar hold on October 22nd at the “Computational thinking and robotics in education” track in which the LearningML project was presented. The LearningML project aims to bring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to children and people interested in acquiring knowledge on this subject in an easy way. AI has heavily irrupted in society and everyone is using, more or less consciously, application based on AI. Therefore, some kind of AI literacy is needed if we are to educate critically thinking citizens able to understand technologies that have a relevant impact on their lives. In this presentation we show how LearningML can help us to reach this goal trough programming applications based on Machine Learning (ML), the most prevalent subfield of AI today.","Rodr\'{\i}guez-Garc\'{\i}a, Juan David and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Robles, Gregorio","machine learning, assessment, computational thinking, K-12, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3434780.3436705,2021,3
article,Developing an Intelligent Cloud for Higher Education,"With rapid development in the IT world, technologies are becoming more dynamic and advanced. Today, technologies are changing with customer requirements. In the IT world, research is carried out to make technology better to meet the requirements that change with time. With the advancement in the IT world, online services have proliferated. Now a days, cloud computing is the hottest buzzword in the IT world. Cloud computing is not limited to the E-Governance and business worlds, but is also making a great impact in the education world. With growing demand for education, technologies and research, all universities and education institutions have their eyes on cloud computing. The main pillars of educational institutions are students, faculties, administrations and libraries. Faculty and students do research and need quality data while students of a particular field need a subject-oriented knowledge. Manually getting these kinds of data is time consuming as students depend on literature, books, different kind of software and hardware. With cloud computing in higher education, cost-effective measures can be taken to minimize the dependency on books, hardware and software. In this paper, we discuss how Artifical Intelligence based cloud computing in higher education will improve quality and ease the process of getting e-resources (software/hardware platform, storage etc.). This study will help in understanding effective cost-cutting measures. We also discuss how cloud computing in the library and administration will brighten the education prospects.","Yadav, Nikita and Khatri, Sujata and Singh, V.

inproceedings,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Lawyer's Perspective","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a research direction that was already put under scrutiny, in particular in the AI&amp;Law community. Whilst there were notable developments in the area of (general, not necessarily legal) XAI, user experience studies regarding such methods, as well as more general studies pertaining to the concept of explainability among the users are still lagging behind. This paper firstly, assesses the performance of different explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP), in explaining the predictions for a legal text classification problem; those explanations were then judged by legal professionals according to their accuracy. Secondly, the same respondents were asked to give their opinion on the desired qualities of (explainable) artificial intelligence (AI) legal decision system and to present their general understanding of the term XAI. This part was treated as a pilot study for a more pronounced one regarding the lawyer's position on AI, and XAI in particular.","G\'{o}rski, \L{}ukasz and Ramakrishna, Shashishekar","grad-CAM, SHAP, survey, XAI, LIME, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3462757.3466145,2021,9

article,Quantum Mathematics in Artificial Intelligence,"In the decade since 2010, successes in artificial intelligence have been at the forefront of computer science and technology, and vector space models have solidified a position at the forefront of artificial intelligence. At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way.","Widdows, Dominic and Kitto, Kirsty and Cohen, Trevor","information retrieval, natural language, mathematical foundations",10.1613/jair.1.12702,2022,35
inproceedings,MathE - Improve Mathematical Skills in Higher Education,Higher education students of scientific subjects often lack the basic mathematical skills to follow lectures and make the most of the lecturer's teachings. It is necessary to identify the gaps in each students' understanding of the concepts and offer teachers adequate resources to motivate and provide their students the skills and competences they miss. The main goal of MathE - Improve Maths Skills in Higher Education is to encourage training and exchange in order to enhance and strengthen the quality of teaching and to support the use of digital and online technologies to improve pedagogies and assessment methods. MathE also aims to set up transnational teacher training courses and strengthen cooperation between universities that already offer such courses.,"Pacheco, Maria F. and Pereira, Ana I. and Fernandes, Florbela","pedagogical innovation, higher education, open learning, distance learning, digital resources, school development",10.1145/3318396.3320116,2019,4
article,"Artificial Intelligence, Artists, and Art: Attitudes Toward Artwork Produced by Humans vs. Artificial Intelligence","This study examines how people perceive artwork created by artificial intelligence (AI) and how presumed knowledge of an artist's identity (Human vs. AI) affects individuals’ evaluation of art. Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.","Hong, Joo-Wha and Curran, Nathaniel Ming","human-machine communication, human-computer interaction, schema theory, CASA, creativity, Artificial intelligence, art",10.1145/3326337,2019,16

inproceedings,Facilitating Computing Students' Transition to Higher Education,"Students who progress to higher education from further education colleges are faced with academic, social, and logistical challenges during their transition. In general, they find university life more challenging compared to students who have been at university for two years already. The Associate Student Project (ASP) is an intervention programme within the School of Computing that provides support to students who make this transition. This support includes access to online resources, orientation events, university lectures and workshops, throughout their two years at further education college. This study aims to measure the impact of the ASP through a survey on academic behavioural confidence and a comparison of the grade point average of three student groups: independent direct entrants (n=53), associate students (n=27), and native students (students who entered university at first year, n=75). Analysis revealed that, while independent direct entrants (IDE) were less confident about their studies than native students (NS), there was a closer parity of confidence between native and associate students (AS). In addition, AS' confidence on tasks that relate to requesting information is higher than the other groups, perhaps due to the ASP's emphasis on providing good information to AS and encouraging dialogue. Associate students found interventions that provide insight into university life prior to their transfer useful. Additionally, the grade point average of AS was not found to be significantly different in comparison to native students. This paper reports on the success of these interventions in building student confidence and explores the impact for transitional students.","Fabian, Khristin and Taylor-Smith, Ella and Meharg, Debbie and Varey, Alison","widening participation, student transitions, higher education, further education, direct entrants",10.1145/3351287.3351298,2019,7
inproceedings,Foundations for Esports Curricula in Higher Education,"Esports has generated an industry of increasing economic and cultural importance. In recent years, universities and other higher education institutions have responded to its growth by establishing programmes of study which aim to satisfy the needs of innovators operating in the area. However, there is not yet consensus on what an esports curriculum should include. Despite being a technology-driven sector with ethical and professional dimensions that intersect computing, current ACM and IEEE curricula do not mention esports. Furthermore, existing courses tend to provide teaching and training on a wide variety of topics aside from those traditionally in computer science. These include: live events management; psychological research; sports science; marketing; public relations; video (livestream) production; and community management; in addition to coaching and communication. This working group examined the requirements for developing esports studies at universities with a focus on understanding career prospects in esports and on the challenges presented by its interdisciplinary complexity.

article,Higher Education Check-Ins: Exploring the User Experience of Hybrid Location Sensing,"A large body of literature is dedicated to understanding people's check-in behavior when they use location sharing services to pair their location with a venue, e.g., a restaurant, a park, etc. Check-in behavior in higher education settings, e.g., where students and instructors have academic purposes for check-ins, is under-studied. In this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes.","Huang, Yun and Sang, Yisi and Wu, Qunfang and Yao, Yaxing","hybrid sensing, check-ins, location sharing, bluetooth low energy beacon, automatic location sensing",10.1145/3359168,2019,26

This paper illustrates findings from an empirical study with the purpose of familiarizing two classes of 11-12-year-old children (N=37) with central concepts related to AI, using existing material with modifications. During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.","Khalid, Kashifa and Iivari, Netta and Kinnula, Marianne and Sharma, Sumita",,10.1145/3569219.3569390,2022,5
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Auction Design,"Motivated by online advertising auctions, we study auction design in repeated auctions played by simple Artificial Intelligence algorithms (Q-learning). We find that first-price auctions with no additional feedback lead to tacit-collusive outcomes (bids lower than values), while second-price auctions do not. We show that the difference is driven by the incentive in first-price auctions to outbid opponents by just one bid increment. This facilitates re-coordination on low bids after a phase of experimentation. We also show that providing information about the lowest bid to win, as introduced by Google at the time of the switch to first-price auctions, increases competitiveness of auctions.","Banchio, Martino and Skrzypacz, Andrzej","auction design, algorithmic bidding, Q-learning",10.1145/3490486.3538244,2022,2
inproceedings,A is for Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Activities on Young Children's Perceptions of Robots,"We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.","Williams, Randi and Park, Hae Won and Breazeal, Cynthia","child-robot interaction, ai education, social robots, early childhood education",10.1145/3290605.3300677,2019,11

article,Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: A Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI.

inproceedings,How Do Elementary Students Conceptualize Artificial Intelligence?,"Countries around the globe have acknowledged the pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives and the importance of educating our students on how AI technologies work. For example, the Chinese education ministry has integrated AI into the mandatory high school curriculum, including a pilot textbook to teach students about the fundamental AI technologies like deep learning and recognition. However, there are fewer examples of AI education at the primary level, and these are typically focused on decision-making, machine learning, and programming. We have recently started to develop our own elementary AI curriculum. To develop the curriculum, we first needed to explore what students already knew about AI. Although there are a few small studies on how primary students conceptualize AI, we conducted a study to examine how 10 nine- and ten-year-old students conceptualized artificial intelligence by focusing on two main questions: (1) How do elementary students conceptualize artificial intelligence? (2) What are elementary students' experiences with artificial intelligence? Students? definitions of AI tended to focus on programming and robotics. Students described examples of AI that included robotic vacuums, Siri/Alexa, YouTube, and search engines. They also showcased some misconceptions around AI designs and implementations.","Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Anne and Glazewski, Krista and Jeon, Minji and Hmelo-Silver, Cindy and Mott, Bradford and Lee, Seung and Lester, James","artificial intelligence, elementary education, perceptions",10.1145/3408877.3439642,2021,1

inproceedings,Ontology-Based Recommender System in Higher Education,"Academic advising is limited in its ability to assist students in identifying academic pathways. Selecting a major and a university is a challenging process rife with anxiety. Students at high school are not sure how to match their interests with their working future or major. Therefore, high school students need guidance and support. Moreover, students need to filter, prioritize and efficiently get appropriate information from the web in order to solve the problem of information overload. This paper represents an approach for developing ontology-based recommender system improved with machine learning techniques to orient students in higher education. The proposed recommender system is an assessment tool for students' vocational strengths and weaknesses, interests and capabilities. The main objective of our ontology-based recommender system is to identify the student requirements, interests, preferences and capabilities to recommend the appropriate major and university for each one.","Obeid, Charbel and Lahoud, Inaya and El Khoury, Hicham and Champin, Pierre-Antoine","education, recommender system, ontology-based",10.1145/3184558.3191533,2018,4
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence for Conversational Robo-Advisor,"With the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, the combination of AI with financial technology (FinTech) has become a development trend in the financial industry. However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor.","Day, Min-Yuh and Lin, Jian-Ting and Chen, Yuan-Chih","deep learning, financial technology (FinTech), artificial intelligence (AI), robo-advisor, conversational commerce",,2020,8
inproceedings,Gender Perspective in Artificial Intelligence (AI),"In Spain, the majority of university students are women, but the gender distribution in different fields of study is uneven and there are certain disciplines, as engineering and some experimental sciences where less than 30% are women. This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies.

The job market for artificial intelligence has been promising as many practical applications have become viable nowadays. Over the years, many universities and colleges offers an introductory artificial intelligence course to undergraduate students. With the progress in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, one introductory AI course is insufficient and an approach to integrating artificial intelligence across undergraduate curriculum is essential and appealing. In this poster, we present our project based approach to integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts to a variety of undergraduate courses.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Risk in Design,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are more and more integrated into everyday lives, both scholarly and popular discourses on AI's often revolve around charting the various risks that may be associated with them. The manner and magnitude of risk that various researchers identify and foresee varies; however, what is common between them is, undoubtedly, the concept of risk itself. This concept, we argue, has been largely taken for granted by the fields involved in the research on AI's; in other words, ""risk"" has been employed with an everyday sensibility without due critical examination. In this paper, we address risk as a concept directly, by examining interdisciplinary theories and literatures on risk to discuss examples of AI technologies. Through this work, we aim to begin a critical discussion of the importance of theorising risk within design research and practice, and within the development of emerging technologies.","Luusua, Aale and Ylipulli, Johanna","urban ai, general ai, objective risk, artificial intelligence, risk, theory, experience, subjective risk, narrow ai",10.1145/3357236.3395491,2020,10

inproceedings,Spatial-Data-Driven Student Characterization in Higher Education,"Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of student-related datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework.","Heo, Joon and Chung, Kyong-Mee and Yoon, Sanghyun and Yun, Sung Bum and Ma, Jong Won and Ju, Sungha","Spatial data, Student Characterization, Higher Education, Learning Analytics",10.1145/3152341.3152343,2017,4

My work advocates for a new approach toward the interaction between AI methods and the social that centers principles of distributive justice. As AI increasingly drives consequential social decision-making, we must consider not only what can be done but what ought to be done.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Empowered Domain Modelling Bot,"With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.","Saini, Rijul","natural language processing (NLP), bot, machine learning (ML), natural language (NL), domain model, artificial intelligence (AI)",10.1145/3417990.3419486,2020,6

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in the Government: Responses to Failures and Social Impact,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervading the government and transforming how public services are provided to consumers---from allocation of benefits to law enforcement, risk monitoring and the provision of services. Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI's failures? In thirteen preregistered studies (N = 3,724), we document a robust effect of algorithmic transference: algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans---as outgroups characterized by greater homogeneity than ingroups of comparable humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm at a higher rate than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Assessing AI's impact on consumers and societies, we show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may engender algorithmic transference and undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize.","Longoni, Chiara and Cian, Luca and Kyung, Ellie","social impact, artificial intelligence, public policy, government, algorithm",10.1145/3514094.3534125,2022,1

The aim of this work is to contribute with information about the feelings generated in university students and to know the main characteristics of Higher Education in Ecuador in times of pandemic. Specifically, the question What are the feelings of university students in times of the COVID-19? was answered. For this purpose, a quantitative, transversal and non-experimental research was carried out. Fifty-five unstructured anonymous interviews were conducted. It was applied to students from 16 Higher Education Institutions. Feelings were analyzed using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and through the computer programs MATLAB and NVIVO applied to the 500 phrases, obtained from 55 interviews with an average of 47 words per phrase. When carrying out the sentiment analysis, it was obtained that approximately 64% was negative, 11% neutral and 25% positive.

inproceedings,Do People Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A Cross-Topic Multicultural Study,"In the era of 4.0 industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are the undisputed protagonists on a world-wide stage. In the last decade, expert and learning systems have been widely applied to a plethora of tasks that were considered, in the past, as solvable only by a human. And on top of that, machines are becoming more reliable and accurate than human experts.However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it. In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains.","Kolasinska, Agnieszka and Lauriola, Ivano and Quadrio, Giacomo","human perception, machine learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3342428.3342667,2019,6

Although the domain of AI has seen substantial improvements over recent years, its effectiveness is limited by the capabilities of current computing technology. Recently, there have been several architectural innovations for AI using emerging nanotechnology. These architectures implement mathematical computations of AI with circuits that utilize physical behavior of nanodevices purpose-built for such computations. This approach leads to a much greater efficiency vs. software algorithms running on von Neumann processors or CMOS architectures, which emulate the operations with transistor circuits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these architectural directions and categorize them based on their contributions.

inproceedings,Better Metrics for Evaluating Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"This paper presents objective metrics for how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be quantified. Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.","Rosenfeld, Avi","system evaluation, explainable artificial intelligence, interpretable machine learning, human-agent systems",,2021,6

Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills.

inproceedings,Artificial Concepts of Artificial Intelligence: Institutional Compliance and Resistance in AI Startups,"Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI"" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.","Winecoff, Amy A. and Watkins, Elizabeth Anne","organizational theory, artificial intelligence, ethical systems, industry practice, qualitative methods",10.1145/3514094.3534138,2022,12

inproceedings,Graduates' Prediction System Using Artificial Intelligence,"Graduation rates are an essential metric for universities to gauge the effectiveness of their programmes. Prediction models can be used to assess students' likelihood of completing their degrees, as well as to analyse the rate of completion of programmes that they offer.Several studies have been done previously using predictive models in various universities around the world. At King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB), Prachuabsupakij and Wuttikamolchai developed a web application that used the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict student's graduation. Other studies made use of other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, neural network and classification and regression tree algorithms. These studies achieved a successful prediction rate of an average of above 70% accuracy.The University of Namibia does not have any predictive models of any kind and neither has any study of this nature ever been done. It was for this reason that this study was conducted using the School of Computing as the case study. The study would then develop a graduates' prediction system for the school of computing.The system is a web-based application that requires a user to log in before accessing its features, such as displaying the predicted outcomes. A sample of 500 student data was used to create the student dataset. The prediction was done using four different prediction models which were then comparatively analysed. Those prediction models are Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest.The web-based application consists of an interactive dashboard to allow the user to visualize the prediction results which can be view using different types of charts all to the user's convenience.This study managed to attain its main object of creating a student graduation prediction system for the school of computing and the sub-objective were also met. The predictions of this study were purely based on the students' academic results in the form of credit scores and other factors were not considered.

It needs to completely deduce all links, such as the coupling of intelligent technology innovation, the coupling of intelligent new products in the industrial chain, the coupling of intelligent policy network collaborative subjects, and the coupling of the market, The ultimate goal is to realize the coupling route of artificial intelligence system + large-scale operational sports industry.","Yang, Bo","Artificial intelligence, Commercial sports industry, Coupling model, Influence application",10.1145/3545822.3545833,2022,6

inproceedings,Gender Bias in Artificial Intelligence: The Need for Diversity and Gender Theory in Machine Learning,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machine's ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language. Awareness of this research and incorporating it into approaches to machine learning from text would help prevent the generation of biased algorithms. Leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence are also primarily female, suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it. Gender balance in machine learning is therefore crucial to prevent algorithms from perpetuating gender ideologies that disadvantage women.","Leavy, Susan","text analytics, machine learning, gender bias",10.1145/3195570.3195580,2018,3

inproceedings,Should Artificial Intelligence Governance Be Centralised? Design Lessons from History,"Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply inadequate.","Cihon, Peter and Maas, Matthijs M. and Kemp, Luke","centralization, institutional design, governance fragmentation, global governance, artificial intelligence policy, regime complex",10.1145/3375627.3375857,2020,7
inproceedings,Automated Condition Monitoring Using Artificial Intelligence,"Machine maintenance is a major part of total operating costs for manufacturing and production plants, hence, having a cost-effective maintenance strategy is key to success. Most standard solutions operate on a time-driven approach where repairs or replacements are carried out after a given amount of time. This results in healthy machines being replaced unnecessarily incurring losses in both time, resource, and parts. Predictive maintenance utilises sensors capable of collecting real-time operating data and analytical techniques to predict when a machine will require maintenance. This research develops a vibration analysis tool that can detect and differentiate a machines operating conditions without any human analysis or intervention demonstrated via a case study. By using spectrograms in conjunction with image recognition and unsupervised learning, the tool is capable of being applied to many different machines without modification. Results show that features extracted using convolutional auto-encoding and t-SNE, are capable of being clustered in an unsupervised manner accurately based on case study test conditions. Future work looks at the application of this tool into a real-time data stream that can determine operating conditions in real-time.","Griffiths, Ieuan","Predictive maintenance, Unsupervised learning, Fault detection, Machine maintenance, Signal processing, Neural networks, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Condition monitoring",10.1145/3448823.3448863,2021,7

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Education: Ethical Issues and Its Regulations,"After the birth of human beings, biological evolution essentially ceased. Since then, the evolution of human civilization has been initiated, with curiosity driving science and the desire for control driving technology. The development of science and technology has unfolded in two dimensions of outward and inward, the outward from the solar system, the galaxy to the universe; the inward pointing to human itself, from the movement of life to the movement of consciousness, giving rise to artificial intelligence (AI). For the first time, the ""human-like"" nature of AI has shaken the social activity in which the world is the stage and humans are the main actors, leading to the ethical issues of AI, of course, including the ethical issues of AI in education(AIEd). The ethical issue of AIEd is the problem caused by the transformation of the actors by implanting humanoids into the human educational community. The main issues include the ethical problem of AI, the adaption of new human and new norms of human behaviors, and the stage for the activities of the actors—the field of AIEd. The regulations of ethical issues of AIEd should aim at the pursuit of human well-being and focus on practice, mainly from the aspects of customs transfer, norms construction and legislation constraints.","Zhang, Liguo and Fu, Kefeng and Liu, Xiaolin","Regulations, Artificial Intelligence, AI in Education, Ethical Issues, Educational Ethics",10.1145/3524383.3524406,2022,6

As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog traditional hurdles such as poor infrastructure and bureaucracy. At the same time, an investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society: it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage. In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for AI in India. We detail opportunities that are cross-cutting (bridging India's linguistic divisions, mining public data), and also specific to one particular sector (healthcare). We list challenges that originate from existing social conditions (such as equations of caste and gender). Thereafter we distill out concrete steps and safeguards, which we believe are necessary for robust and inclusive development as India enters the AI era.","Kalyanakrishnan, Shivaram and Panicker, Rahul Alex and Natarajan, Sarayu and Rao, Shreya","artificial intelligence, india",10.1145/3278721.3278738,2018,7
inproceedings,Estimating Student Dropout in Distance Higher Education Using Semi-Supervised Techniques,"Nowadays, distance higher education has rapidly increased due to advance and integration of information and communications' technology. Students who attend online distance courses have often family obligations and job commitments and are usually in 'high risk' of dropout during their attendance. It is of a highly importance to identify such students, through paying extra attention and support to them could possibly minimize the possibility of student failure or even dropout. The present research intends to study whether semi-supervised techniques could be useful in student dropout prediction in distance higher education. Semi-supervised learning aims to generate reliable predictions using few labeled and many unlabeled data. Labeled data are difficult obtainable quite often, as they require many experts, a lot of human effort and time in experiments. As far as, we are aware in several studies propose and compare supervised methods for students' dropout prediction rates in higher education, but none of them investigates the effectiveness of semi-supervised methods. The results of our experiments reveal that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved using few labeled data in comparison to well known supervised learning algorithms. For that purpose we have developed a web-based tool to estimate if an individual student is going to dropout.","Kostopoulos, Georgios and Kotsiantis, Sotiris and Pintelas, Panagiotis","distance higher education, tri-training algorithm, semi-supervised learning, C4.5 decision tree, dropout",10.1145/2801948.2802013,2015,6

These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics?

We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study.

inproceedings,Conceptual Challenges of Researching Artificial Intelligence in Public Administrations,"Research has been advancing on the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administrations. However, there is limited consensus and agreement on what is considered Artificial Intelligence, as different understandings and approaches in research and practice exist. This paper explores and compares the varying ways AI has been described and understood in previous Information Systems and eGovernment research. Following, a survey amongst Belgium civil servants is analysed to assess what they associate with the term Artificial Intelligence. The findings show that many civil servants tend to associate AI with being able to conduct intelligent tasks, have certain capabilities or are specific applications they are familiar with. Specific algorithms or learning methods, often included in research papers, are not associated with the term AI. These results show that researchers and policymakers may have opposite or even paradoxical views on what is or is not AI, which could have significant consequences for researching the adoption of AI in government, as well as comparing different research findings. In this respect, the paper proposes to use an integrative lens to study AI in government, by including different dimensions and understandings.","van Noordt, Colin","Public administration, Perceptions, Civil Servants, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3543434.3543441,2022,8

inproceedings,Hard Choices and Hard Limits in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is supposed to help us make better choices. Some of these choices are small, like what route to take to work, or what music to listen to. Others are big, like what treatment to administer for a disease or how long to sentence someone for a crime. If AI can assist with these big decisions, we might think it can also help with hard choices, cases where alternatives are neither better, worse nor equal but on a par. The aim of this paper, however, is to show that this view is mistaken: the fact of parity shows that there are hard limits on AI in decision making and choices that AI cannot, and should not, resolve.","Goodman, Bryce","hard choices, fairness, AI ethics, value alignment",10.1145/3461702.3462539,2021,10

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Conversational Agents: A Study of Factors Related to Perceived Humanness in Chatbots,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in service-oriented businesses in the form of chatbots. A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.","Svenningsson, Nina and Faraon, Montathar","chatbot, AI, humanness, user experience, design guideline, conversation, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3375959.3375973,2020,11
inproceedings,The Seductive Allure of Artificial Intelligence-Powered Neurotechnology,"Neuroscience explanations-even when completely irrelevant-have been shown to exert a ""seductive allure"" on individuals, leading them to judge bad explanations or arguments more favorably. There seems to be a similarly seductive allure for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, leading people to ""overtrust"" these systems, even when they have just witnessed the system perform poorly. The AI-powered neurotechnologies that have begun to proliferate in recent years, particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), represent a potentially doubly-alluring combination. While there is enormous potential benefit in applying AI techniques in neuroscience to ""decode"" brain activity and associated mental states, these efforts are still in the early stages, and there is a danger in using these unproven technologies prematurely, especially in important, real-world contexts. Yet, such premature use has begun to emerge in several high-stakes set-tings, including the law, health &amp; wellness, employment, and transportation. In light of the potential seductive allure of these technologies, we need to be vigilant in monitoring their scientific validity and challenging both unsubstantiated claims and misuse, while still actively supporting their continued development and proper use.","Giattino, Charles M. and Kwong, Lydia and Rafetto, Chad and Farahany, Nita A.","decoding, overtrust, EEG, neurotechnology",10.1145/3306618.3314269,2019,6
inproceedings,"Robot-Robot Interaction, Toward New Conversational Artificial Intelligence Aesthetic","Artificial Intelligence nowadays is an intriguing medium for the new generation of contemporary artists. They are many approaches to the utilization of AI as creative media. Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis. Consequently, we aim to raise some of the fundamental questions about artificial intelligence's impact on future human-AI society.

Experts have gone so far as to chart the future development of AI systems that surpass human intelligence as a single civilization-shifting event, known as the ""technological singularity"" or ""the Singularity."" But in the more near future, AI promises to have more concrete applications throughout our everyday lives, including in education, a challenge that China has already taken up. At present, the main applications of this so-called ""weak"" artificial intelligence in Chinese education are MOOC, web classes, and the flipped class model, with the results already proving outstanding. With the deeper combination of AI and education, we can look forward to benefits like the increasing usefulness of after-school tutoring robots, reliving teachers of burdensome responsibilities, and balancing global education resources. We should, however, also use AI in education reasonably by contextualizing gathered data, strengthening legal protections, and developing moral guidelines in machine programming. Addressing these three points will address the concerns of many laypeople as AI systems are implemented, offering protection for their fragile beginnings in education and encouraging the development of better ones in the future.","Peng, Liu and Xiaohong, Si","Education and teaching in China, Development prediction, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3234825.3234839,2018,4

inproceedings,Teachers’ Perspective on Artificial Intelligence Education: An Initial Investigation,"Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.","Polak, Sara and Schiavo, Gianluca and Zancanaro, Massimo","AI Education, Digital Competencies, Computing education",10.1145/3491101.3519866,2022,7

inproceedings,Training Path of College Tennis Talents Based on Artificial Intelligence,"Tennis is a unique and beautiful sport. In recent years, tennis has become more and more enthusiastic around the world, and some tennis academies have sprung up like bamboo shoots. With the gradual improvement of the tennis atmosphere, the tennis crowd has gradually increased, but at this time there is a lack of a comprehensive tennis training base and a scientific and systematic talent training model to promote the development of Chinese tennis in the future. And it happens to be a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this article studies and discusses the training path of tennis talents in colleges and universities based on artificial intelligence. Through an in-depth analysis of the training path of our country's tennis competitive talents, the current stage of our country's tennis talent training mainly relies on the following three methods: sports team training model; club training model; government, enterprise, and family joint training model. Through the introduction of artificial intelligence-related technologies, experiments on these three methods are conducted in the artificial intelligence environment. The results show that, compared with ordinary tennis talent training models, the physical and humanistic qualities of college tennis talents get 30%. The improvement of the service period and technical level of college tennis competitive talents has also reached 10% compared with the traditional training path. This shows that in the current global environment, combining the training path of tennis competitive talents in colleges and universities with the emerging artificial intelligence technology, the effect is very significant, and it is the development trend of future tennis competitive talent training.","Lv, Lili and Xu, Yijun",,10.1145/3495018.3495290,2022,5

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Perspectives: Protecting and Empowering Intelligent Human Beings,"As 'control' is increasingly ceded to AI systems, potentially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) humanity may be facing an identity crisis sooner rather than later, whereby the notion of 'intelligence' no longer remains solely our own. This paper characterizes the problem in terms of an impending loss of control and proposes a relational shift in our attitude towards AI. The shortcomings of value alignment as a solution to the problem are outlined which necessitate an extension of these principles. One such approach is considering strongly relational Indigenous epistemologies. The value of Indigenous perspectives has not been canvassed widely in the literature. Their utility becomes clear when considering the existence of well-developed epistemologies adept at accounting for the non-human, a task that defies Western anthropocentrism. Accommodating AI by considering it as part of our network is a step towards building a symbiotic relationship. Given that AGI questions our fundamental notions of what it means to have human rights, it is argued that in order to co-exist, we find assistance in Indigenous traditions such as the Hawaiian and Lakota ontologies. Lakota rituals provide comfort with the conception of non-human soul-bearer while Hawaiian stories provide possible relational schema to frame our relationship with AI.","Maitra, Suvradip","indigenous perspectives, value alignment, human rights, ethics, relational shift",10.1145/3375627.3375845,2020,7

article,Trailblazing the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity Discipline: A Multi-Disciplinary Research Roadmap,"Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

inproceedings,Learning Analytics in Higher Education: The Student Expectations of Learning Analytics,"The report's purpose is to discover whether individual differences are connected with student expectations for learning analytics. The aim was to evaluate if the Big Five personality traits are connected to student predictions about learning analytics. Learning analytics is well-positioned to greatly improve student learning. There are many unanswered questions that are intertwined in that belief, which deals with learning analytics as a whole. Students' learning processes can be better supported and understood by using learning analytics. The goal of this investigation is to examine students' ideas about learning analytics tools' attributes and their interest in applying these features for education. In a first-stage investigation, researchers interviewed 364 university students. Smart PLS was used to carry out data analysis. Research that involves exploratory research will benefit from using partial least squares (PLS). The equal engagement of all stakeholders, from external organisations to individual students, is a challenge faced by each university given the global interest in learning analytics. Student expectations of learning analytics elements were discovered, and students are looking for support with planning and organising their learning processes, tools for self-assessment, delivery of adaptive recommendations, and personal evaluations of their learning.","Abdul Jalil, Nasir and Wong Ei Leen, Mikkay","Learning analytics, Higher Education, Educational Technology",10.1145/3502434.3502463,2022,6
inproceedings,"Formalizing Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Prerequisites, Causes and Goals of Human Trust in AI","Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.","Jacovi, Alon and Marasovi\'{c}, Ana and Miller, Tim and Goldberg, Yoav","distrust, contractual trust, trustworthy, artificial intelligence, sociology, warranted trust, trust, formalization",10.1145/3442188.3445923,2021,12

article,Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence: Evidence from a Survey of Machine Learning Researchers,"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang &amp; Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

article,In the Black Mirror: Youth Investigations into Artificial Intelligence,"Over the past two decades, innovations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have extended into nearly all facets of human experience. Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.","Lee, Clifford H. and Gobir, Nimah and Gurn, Alex and Soep, Elisabeth","ethics-centered, computational thinking, engagement, machine learning, media, agency, Critical pedagogy, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3484495,2022,25

This leads to new developments and challenges in education with regard to competency-based learning and recognition practices, especially as educational biographies become increasingly diverse and extensive repetitions of qualifications should be avoided. Until recently, a common assessment strategy for previously developed competencies has not been established in higher education. In this study, competencies expected in German vocational and higher educational programming training were identified, compared and evaluated with regard to equivalence. The methodological approach started with an extensive review of general frameworks and curricula, before competency descriptions and analyses of reference documents of German vocational and university programming education were gathered and systematically compared. As part of the iterative design process, a comparison matrix was developed, and common features along with gaps and overlaps of competencies were identified. Even though both educational tracks pursue different goals, they share a great number of expected programming competencies. In the context of lifelong learning, the proposed process can be utilized for improving the permeability and recognition practises in both vocational training and higher education.","Kiesler, Natalie and Thorbr\""{u}gge, Carsten","competency, comparison, programming education, vocational training, educational system analysis, recognition, higher education",10.1145/3502718.3524818,2022,7
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Organizational Memory in Government: The Experience of Record Duplication in the Child Welfare Sector in Canada,"In recent years, the topic of artificial intelligence in government has become a major area of study. Governments have been eager to adopt artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including for the prediction of risk in social services. Child protection services are exploring predictive analytics for the initial screening of cases. While research identifies data quality issues as a major barrier, little is known about the characteristics of these issues in child protection, their relationship to organizational memory contained in administrative data, and their impact on the ability of an organization to adopt these technologies. This study gained insight into the socio-technical limitations of duplicate records when trying to bring organizational memory to bear in predictive decision support by interviewing and observing staff use of information technology systems. The study's findings suggest that record duplication in case management systems in child protection could pose a significant challenge to the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies such as predictive analytics for decision assistance. There is a need to address foundational information management and system issues before artificial intelligence approaches such as this can be introduced in the child protection sector.","M.

article,Exploitation for Multimedia Asian Information Processing and Artificial Intelligence-Based Art Design and Teaching in Colleges,"Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and learning due to its quick progress. &nbsp;Any creation made with the help of artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Meets Kinesthetic Intelligence: Mouse-Based User Authentication Based on Hybrid Human-Machine Learning,"Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset).

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on the Prediction of Economic Indicators,"Economic indicators are key statistics based on economy, some examples of economic indicators are inflation rate, gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, consumer price indices (CPI), interest rate, exports, consumption of energy, among others. Most of the published studies are focused on contextualizing and predict a particular economic indicator without considering the current general situation on how non-linear models have been used in predicting some of the economic indicators. This article, has analyzed in the scientific production the artificial intelligence methods mostly used in the development of prediction models of economic indicators. The study was carried out by means of a systematic literature review (SLR) using the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar bibliographic databases (BD) as resources. The documents and general information analyzed qualitatively are filtered between the range of years 2015 to 2019 to which an adequate set of quality and selection criteria were applied. The approach of the research questions allowed to describe the outcomes in categories where the studies by predicted economic indicator and applied artificial intelligence method have been successfully included. The outcomes that have been obtained in this article represent a starting point for researchers, academics and professionals who wish to carry out studies related to the prediction of economic indicators using some artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In conclusion, some of the artificial intelligence methods used to predict economic indicators are artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive systems of diffuse neuro inference (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), support vector regression (SVR), machines extreme learning and other machine learning (ML) techniques.","Ram\'{\i}rez, Kevin Mero and Hormaza, Jaime Meza and Soto, Sebasti\'{a}n Ventura","economic indicator prediction models, nonlinear models, Artificial intelligence models",10.1145/3410352.3410827,2020,8

inproceedings,Innovative Application of Artificial Intelligence Technology in College Physical Education,"With the gradual enrichment of people's material life, more people have a stronger desire to pursue spiritual life. As an important carrier of physical education (PD) in colleges and universities, (artificial intelligence) AI technology, its role cannot be ignored. However, at this stage, the intelligent construction of college gymnasiums in our country is still in its infancy, and there is still a lot of room for development. The purpose of this article is to study the innovative application of AI technology in college PD. Taking the gymnasium of the college of PD as the object, through the analysis of the intelligent system of the gymnasium of the sports college, the integration and linkage functions of its AI system are discussed, and related issues in the planning and design of the intelligent system of the college gymnasium are proposed, and these issues are discussed. It is proposed that relevant design factors should be fully considered when designing the intelligent system of college gymnasiums, so as to realize the goals of advanced technology, maturity, reasonable economy, practical functions, safety and reliability, and sustainable development. The college gymnasium is an important support point for the development of college sports teaching innovation. Its AI system has strong professionalism. In the early stage of its planning and design, the entire gymnasium needs to be accurately positioned in conjunction with the corresponding sports items, and the gymnasium accepts the main personnel are the starting point, and the relevant information system layout is guided by the difference of different spatial information needs, which fully reflects the ""people-oriented"" principle. The experimental results show that the scores of students in the experimental group are mostly 85 points and above, while the results of students in the control group are concentrated in the range of 65 to 85. The practical ability of PD students under the AI gymnasium has improved significantly. Students are explaining and organizing actions. There is a good learning ability in teaching activities.","Lou, Zhen",,10.1145/3482632.3483082,2021,5

As the use of data analytics become more common, educators are often required not only to make sense of the analytics, but also make meaning pedagogically to better support the learner and the learning. This paper discusses the conceptualization and implementation of targeted learner support and intervention with the use of learning analytics and data visualization for the adult learner in higher education. The key objective is to leverage on learners’ metrics in a format with visual indicators that give an overview of various aspects of the learning so that higher education institutions can profile their adult learners and anticipate their needs with customized advisories and intervention approaches. The learner metrics is presented in two different dashboards, applying both descriptive and predictive analytics, to provide deeper insights.","Chong, Sylvia and Lee, Yew Haur and Tang, Yoke Wah","adult learners, data visualization, Learning analytics",10.1145/3421682.3421698,2020,6
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in the Construction of an Adaptive Pedagogical Model for Mathematics Leveling,"There is an enormous disadvantage for students who, due to different situations, have decided to return to higher education after a prolonged period of time, in the face of an educational system designed for optimal conditions for students. The disadvantage deepens when already in their adult stage, the time for academic dedication decreases due to their work occupations. This proposal aims to adapt the pedagogical model to their needs, specific needs in logic and mathematical operability, time, mobility, and location. Achieving this requires the design of a hybrid application based primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to achieve the adaptation to the student through the correct training of neural networks, resulting in the identification of the specific requirements of each user and the selection and application of strategies, teaching techniques and content of the mathematics program to be learned and apprehended by the person who must remedy the shortcomings caused by the cessation and in many cases by a poor academic process. The following is a tour through the different aspects that support the proposal; from the need presented by students with academic cessation to the approach of a technological and specific solution for each individual starting from the generality of the causes to the possibility of giving a unique result thanks to the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.","Mart\'{\i}nez, Efra\'{\i}n and Queiruga-Dios, Araceli and Rasteiro, Deolinda","Machine Learning, Apps, Mathematics, neural networks, Artificial intelligence, Academic Assignments, pedagogical model",10.1145/3486011.3486551,2021,5

inproceedings,"Implications of AI (Un-)Fairness in Higher Education Admissions: The Effects of Perceived AI (Un-)Fairness on Exit, Voice and Organizational Reputation","Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.","Marcinkowski, Frank and Kieslich, Kimon and Starke, Christopher and L\""{u}nich, Marco","higher education systems, reputation, exit, procedural fairness, voice, algorithmic decision making, distributive fairness, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3351095.3372867,2020,9
inproceedings,Curriculum Design for a Multidisciplinary Embedded Artificial Intelligence Course: (Abstract Only),"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are rapidly developing fields, garnering increased attention from the public, as well as academia and industry. Recent advances allow us to use our smart devices at home to control TVs, speakers, and lights. A smart speaker that is plugged into the wall can handle powerful processing that can service complex user requests. However, as we rely more and more on AI conveniences, we expect them to be at our disposal when we are moving around. In this poster, we present preliminary work on the development of a new upper-level undergraduate course open to all computer science, electrical engineering, and applied mathematics students at Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT). The new course, titled Embedded AI (EAI), introduces topics from embedded systems, artificial intelligence, digital signal processing, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. The proposed course includes lectures introducing the theory behind each topic and laboratory assignments that provide the students with the hands-on experience. At the end of the semester, students develop an embedded AI project of their own. An interdisciplinary academic team of computer scientists and electrical and computer engineers has been working on a curriculum and researching different platforms, datasets and sensors that will ultimately enable students at WIT to develop an embedded device that can support AI tasks as well as give the students the practical skills that employers seek.

inproceedings,Understanding How People Reason about Aesthetic Evaluations of Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making remarkable achievements even in creative fields such as aesthetics. However, whether those outside the machine learning (ML) community can sufficiently interpret or agree with their results, especially in such highly subjective domains, is being questioned. In this paper, we try to understand how different user communities reason about AI algorithm results in subjective domains. We designed AI Mirror, a research probe that tells users the algorithmically predicted aesthetic scores of photographs. We conducted a user study of the system with 18 participants from three different groups: AI/ML experts, domain experts (photographers), and general public members. They performed tasks consisting of taking photos and reasoning about AI Mirror's prediction algorithm with think-aloud sessions, surveys, and interviews.

inproceedings,A Review of Taxonomies of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Methods,"The recent surge in publications related to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has led to an almost insurmountable wall if one wants to get started or stay up to date with XAI. For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.","Speith, Timo","explainable artificial intelligence, XAI, interpretability, taxonomy, transparency, review, explainability",10.1145/3531146.3534639,2022,12

article,The Design of Reciprocal Learning Between Human and Artificial Intelligence,"The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.","Zagalsky, Alexey and Te'eni, Dov and Yahav, Inbal and Schwartz, David G. and Silverman, Gahl and Cohen, Daniel and Mann, Yossi and Lewinsky, Dafna","AI, feedback, cyber-security, accuracy, human intelligence, context, text classification, explainabilitiy",10.1145/3479587,2021,36

article,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creativity of Videos,"This study explored the impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) has on the evaluation of creative elements in artistic videos. The aim was to verify to what extent the use of an AI algorithm (Style Transfer) contributes to changes in the perceived creativity of the videos. Creativity was evaluated in six quantitative items (Likert-type scale) and one qualitative question (qualitative description of the creativity expressed in the video by two words or expressions). Six videos were shown to both control (N = 49) and experimental group (N = 52) aiming at determining possible differences in creativity assessment criteria. Furthermore, both groups contained experts (Experimental, N = 27; Control, N = 25) and non-experts (Experimental, N = 25; Control, N = 24). The first round of videos composed of six videos that were the same for both the experimental and control condition (used to check for bias). No significant differences were found. In a second round, six videos were shown with AI transformation (experimental condition) and without that transformation (control group). Results showed that in two cases the perceived creativity increased in experimental condition, in one case a decrease occurred. In most evaluations no differences were observed. Qualitative evaluations reinforce the absence of a general pattern of improvements in AI transformations. Altogether, the results emphasize the importance of human mediation in the application of AI in creative production: a hybrid approach, or rather, Hybrid Intelligence.","Rebelo, Ana Daniela Peres and In\^{e}s, Guedes De Oliveira and Damion, D.

inproceedings,Investigating Soft Skills Development at a Higher Education Institution in South Africa,"There seems to be a gap between what industry expect from employees on the one hand, and the soft skills of recent graduates from Higher Education Institutions on the other. The aim of this paper was to investigate if the perceptions of IT-students regarding their own soft skills have changed over a period of 3 years. To do this a questionnaire was distributed in 2019 to the same students who completed this questionnaire in 2016, and the results were analysed. The results of this study showed that although soft skills should increase from student's first year of study to their final year, this is not how the students perceive the development of their own soft skills. The biggest improvements were in the students' perceptions of their skills in cross-cultural relationships, work ethic, decision-making and critical thinking. The skills for client management, time management, professionalism and leadership were perceived as lower. The results confirmed that the IT-students' own perceptions are not a reliable way of measuring their soft skills. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of factors for further study, and according to this results the important soft skills were: Communication; Conflict management; Critical thinking; Interpersonal relations and teamwork; Leadership and Emotional intelligence; Multidisciplinary thinking; Professionalism and work ethic; and Self-management. These can now be used in further research on soft skills.","Taylor, Estelle","Soft skills, industry, higher education, information technology",10.1145/3371647.3371669,2020,7

inproceedings,Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Human Embryo Cell Cleavage Stages Analysis,"Many couples struggle with infertility, and opt for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Selecting the embryo with the highest chance of resulting in pregnancy, is one of the most critical steps of the ART procedure. The implantation potential of an embryo is associated with its morphology which includes assessing cell cleavage stages. Today, the assessment is mainly done manually by visual examination by embryologist and therefore is often subjective. Deep learning (DL) models can be used to automatically classify cell cleavage stages, and make the embryo assessment process efficient, objective. However, it is important that embryologists understand and trust the DL predictions, and in this paper we evaluate the potential of three explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. First, we compare the two XAI techniques Grad-CAM and LIME to identify important characteristics in embryo images associated with specific embryo cleavage stages. Both approaches identified biologically relevant morphological characteristics, but generally Grad-CAM was more consistent than LIME. Secondly, we suggest an approach on how to use the XAI technique SHAP to identify image characteristics that caused some images to be misclassified. The identified image characteristics had meaningful biological interpretation such as fragmentation. Overall the study demonstrates that DL in combination XAI can be useful in embryo assessment and selection.","Sharma, Akriti and Stensen, Mette H. and Delbarre, Erwan and Haugen, Trine B. and Hammer, Hugo L.","embryo cell cleavage stage, embryo morphology assessment, assisted reproduction technology, deep learning, explainable AI",10.1145/3512731.3534206,2022,8

The advancement of knowledge needed to adequately manage these resources has traditionally been achieved through specialization. In this strategy of dividing and ruling, what was gained in depth was lost in coverage. Yet, the most recent problems are intensely interdisciplinary, revealing that the previous specialization strategy is currently not wrong, but clearly insufficient. Strangely (or not), various courses in higher education continued to follow the traditional specialization strategy. As a result of this state-of-affairs, several conferences currently exist, both in the field of Education or in the field of Sustainability, but it has been particularly difficult to attract participants to deepen the theme of Teaching Sustainability.

inproceedings,Theories of Parenting and Their Application to Artificial Intelligence,"As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely. These principles may encourage new thinking about the development, design, training, and release into the world of increasingly autonomous agents.","Croeser, Sky and Eckersley, Peter","artificial intelligence, parenting, machine learning, ethics",10.1145/3306618.3314231,2019,6
inproceedings,The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Emotion Detection: A Study Based on the Effect of Parenting Style on Micro-Expression Recognition Ability of College Students,"Accurate recognition of micro-expressions facilitates emotional communication, and correct capture of expressions is associated with deception detection. The combination of artificial intelligence and psychology can be widely used in various fields such as national life, agricultural production, product development, and garrison construction. This study analyzes and explores whether there is a correlation between parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability, which can provide a basis for subsequent artificial intelligence to detect emotions. This paper mainly uses offline collection of micro-expression recognition data and filling out questionnaires at the same time to collect data and conduct survey research. A total of 175 questionnaires were collected, of which 175 were valid. 110 data of micro-expression recognition were collected, of which 100 were valid. The results found that there was a significant correlation between the parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability of college students. Specifically, the rejection dimension of parents was significantly and negatively correlated with micro-expression recognition ability. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of fields, among which the combination of machine learning and expression recognition can effectively improve the possibility of screening out suspicious people in specific situations.","Duan, Yuanyuan and Shen, Xunbing","micro-expression recognition, parenting style, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3500931.3500956,2021,5

article,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Image Analysis of Bacterial Cells and Biofilms,"The current study explores an artificial intelligence framework for measuring the structural features from microscopy images of the bacterial biofilms. <italic>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</italic> G20 (DA-G20) grown on mild steel surfaces is used as a model for sulfate reducing bacteria that are implicated in microbiologically influenced corrosion problems. Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.","Ragi, Shankarachary and Rahman, Md Hafizur and Duckworth, Jamison and Jawaharraj, Kalimuthu and Chundi, Parvathi and Gadhamshetty, Venkataramana",,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3138304,2021,11

A Perception Bias Towards Artificial Intelligence?,"Via generative adversarial networks (GANs), artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced many areas, especially the artistic field, as symbol of a human task. In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.","Ragot, Martin and Martin, Nicolas and Cojean, Salom\'{e}","GAN, artificial intelligence, bias, AI, can, painting, computational creativity, authorship, arts",10.1145/3334480.3382892,2020,10

inproceedings,Redefining Teacher Qualification in the Artificial Intelligence Era: A Professional Capital Perspective,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is challenging teacher professionalism, thus how to define a teacher in the AI era has become a hot topic in education. Many studies adopted a teacher literacy perspective on redefining a teacher for artificial intelligence in education(AIEd), while ignoring the sociological observation of the challenges faced with teachers in their professional field. This paper was framed by the core concept “professional capital” from sociology, the revolutionary power in the field, analyzed the trend of education field evolving from traditional education to AIEd. Based on the analysis, the paper proposed that, teacher professional capital is the impetus that empowers teachers to reconstruct their professional identity in the AI era. Teacher professional capital for AIEd mainly manifests itself in three forms: teacher human capital(THC), representing teacher agency to teach with AI at the individual level; teacher social capital(TSC), representing the synergetic resources circulating in teachers’ social networks at the interpersonal system; teacher decisional capital(TDC), representing the collaborative decision-making power at the human-AI level. In teachers’ professional practice, THC empowers teachers the capability to transit from traditional education field to AIEd field; TSC endows teachers the power to leverage other people's professional capital to teach with AI; TDC ensures teachers professional autonomy to teach with AI in a reasonable and legal manner.","Liu, Xiaolin and Li, Yaoqing","Education Field, Pedagogy Innovation, Teacher Professional Development, Teacher Professional Capital, Artificial Intelligence in Education",10.1145/3524383.3524405,2022,5

article,Early Exploration of MOOCs in the U.S. Higher Education: An Absorptive Capacity Perspective,"Advanced information technologies have enabled Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which have the potential to transform higher education around the world. Why are some institutions eager to embrace this technology-enabled model of teaching, while others remain reluctant to jump aboard? Applying the theory of absorptive capacity, we study the role of a university's educational IT capabilities in becoming an early MOOC producer. Examining the history of MOOC offerings by U.S. colleges and universities, we find that prior IT capabilities, such as (1) the use of Web 2.0, social media and other interactive tools for teaching and (2) experience with distance education and hybrid teaching, are positively associated with the early exploration of MOOCs. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of educational IT capabilities is moderated by social integration mechanisms and activation triggers. For example, when instructional IT supporting services are highly decentralized, educational IT capabilities have a greater impact on the probability of a university offering a MOOC. In addition, for colleges facing an adverse environment, such as those experience a decline in college applications, the effect of IT capabilities on the exploration of MOOCs is much stronger.","Huang, Peng and Lucas, Henry C.","absorptive capacity, distance learning, MOOC, online education, IT capability",10.1145/3456295,2021,28

A major offensive strategy exploits steganography to conceal scripts or URLs, which can be used to steal credentials or retrieve additional payloads. A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.","Guarascio, Massimo and Zuppelli, Marco and Cassavia, Nunziato and Caviglione, Luca and Manco, Giuseppe","malware, magecart, artificial intelligence, steganography, information hiding",10.1145/3538969.3544437,2022,7

In this paper, we present a gap analysis of the current state of the art by comparing practices of 39 companies that work with AI systems to the seven key requirements for trustworthy AI presented in the “The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. The key finding of this paper is that there is indeed notable gap between AI ethics guidelines and practice. Especially practices considering the novel requirements for software development, requirements of societal and environmental well-being and diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness were not tackled by companies.","Vakkuri, Ville and Kemell, Kai-Kristian and Tolvanen, Joel and Jantunen, Marianna and Halme, Erika and Abrahamsson, Pekka","Responsible AI, Artificial Intelligence Ethics, Gap Analysis",10.1145/3530019.3530030,2022,10

A corpus-based error analysis methodology was adopted. From the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC), all word formation errors tagged as [fm2] were collected, processed and analyzed. It was found that Chinese college students mainly made four types of errors in word formation. The most common word formation errors in Chinese college students’ writings were erroneous irregular inflections and compound words. The author argues that overgeneralization and the complex processes of English word formation are the main causes of these errors. The findings are significant in helping Chinese English learners identify their errors in word formation and telling teachers what errors learners have made in word formation.","Xia, Lixin","Word formation, English learning and teaching, Error analysis, Corpus linguistics, Interlanguage",10.1145/3463531.3463546,2021,6

inproceedings,An Exploratory Diagnosis of Artificial Intelligence Risks for a Responsible Governance.,"Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.","Teixeira, S\'{o}nia and Rodrigues, Jos\'{e} and Veloso, Bruno and Gama, Jo\~{a}o","Ethical Risks, Governance, Technological Risks, Risk Perception, Diagnosis of the Situation, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3560107.3560298,2022,7
inproceedings,Investigating the Benefits of Applying Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Enhance Learning Experiences in Capstone Courses,"This research seeks to improve the learning experiences in Software Engineering Programs using Virtual Assistants based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Students of Software Engineering Capstone Courses face real world situations and challenges that grant them valuable experiences for their professional preparation. However, since this knowledge is acquired through real-life exposure projects, it is difficult to transmit it among different generations of students. In consequence, all the gained knowledge, experiences, and computer codes developed are lost and cannot be reused outside the project context when they finish their assignment at the end of the semester. To address this challenge, this thesis considers the development of AI based virtual assistants applied in higher education, in a form of a lesson learned system, a recommender system integrated with a chatbot, to help students , solve problems similar to those they face in the different stages of their software project development by recommending previous lessons learned. The innovative contribution lies in the implementation of the described techniques from the state-of-art artificial intelligence field in an educational platform with the goal to leverage the experience gained during years of the teaching a Capstone Course in Software Engineering to new student generations who might benefit from this universal knowledge gained previously, in order to assist software engineering students to enhance their learning experience.","A.

inproceedings,With a Rise in Computing Disciplines Comes a Greater Choice of Computing Degrees in Higher Education,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) internationally are increasingly recognising the importance of understanding student study choices. This is especially true in the field of computing in which skills shortages in the labour market are high but so too are student dropout rates. Loss of interest in the computing field has been reported among the reasons for students dropping out. The aim of this study is to offer a fresh perspective of the factors influencing undergraduate student’s interest and choice of specialisation in computing. Previous studies have mainly focused on five ACM-identified computing disciplines: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. With the ever-growing nature of computing, two more disciplines recently emerged: Cybersecurity and Data Science. HEIs continuously endeavour to expand computing programmes into specialist areas within these disciplines such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, robotics and creative computing. For prospective students, this maze of options can make for a difficult decision. 137 first-year computing students were invited to participate in a mixed-methods survey to explore their choices around cybersecurity and other newer specialisations. The results of the survey were matched with findings from recent literature, and show that personal interest, family, media, career prospects and prior experiences still influence student choices, with media appearing to have a greater impact compared to earlier studies. HEIs can use this when developing effective recruitment strategies in computing.","Redmond, Fiona","computing education, specialisations, disciplines, computing, student choices",10.1145/3564721.3565946,2022,11

inproceedings,Accessible PDFs: Applying Artificial Intelligence for Automated Remediation of STEM PDFs,"People with visual impairments use assistive technology, e.g., screen readers, to navigate and read PDFs. However, such screen readers need extra information about the logical structure of the PDF, such as the reading order, header levels, and mathematical formulas, described in readable form to navigate the document in a meaningful way. This logical structure can be added to a PDF with tags. Creating tags for a PDF is time-consuming, and requires awareness and expert knowledge. Hence, most PDFs are left untagged, and as a result, they are poorly readable or unreadable for people who rely on screen readers. STEM documents are particularly problematic with their complex document structure and complicated mathematical formulae. These inaccessible PDFs present a major barrier for people with visual impairments wishing to pursue studies or careers in STEM fields, who cannot easily read studies and publications from their field. The goal of this Ph.D. is to apply artificial intelligence for document analysis to reasonably automate the remediation process of PDFs and present a solution for large mathematical formulae accessibility in PDFs. With these new methods, the Ph.D. research aims to lower barriers to creating accessible scientific PDFs, by reducing the time, effort, and expertise necessary to do so, ultimately facilitating greater access to scientific documents for people with visual impairments.","Schmitt-Koopmann, Felix M. and Huang, Elaine M. and Darvishy, Alireza","Page Object Detection, Document Analysis, Tagged PDF, Math Viewer, PDF Accessibility, Accessibility, PDF/UA, Formula Recognition, Reading Order",10.1145/3517428.3550407,2022,6

inproceedings,A Pedagogical Approach in Interleaving Software Quality Concerns at an Artificial Intelligence Course,"The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks. The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases. The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.","Cernau, Laura Diana and Dio\c{s}an, Laura Silvia and undefinederban, Camelia","code quality, software engineering, software metrics",10.1145/3548660.3561332,2022,7

However, there is a current lack of research relating to best practice for teaching this complex topic area which encompasses both computing and mathematics knowledge. This paper outlines an initial study that set out to determine the threshold concepts within this domain through use of the One Minute Paper technique with students currently studying AI. Our results identified a number of specific models which students found troublesome including the support vector machine, recurrent neural network and the multilayer perceptron. The results indicated that topics related to deep learning were more complex for the students to fully comprehend and students may require greater in-depth tuition and alternative support mechanisms in this area in particular. Further investigation is needed to determine the heterogeneity of content delivered on courses relating to AI as well as additional studies at other HE institutions to gather more data on potential threshold concepts and the best methods to teach them.","Allen, Becky and Devlin, Marie and McGough, A.Stephen","Threshold Concepts, Higher Education, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3437914.3437974,2021,4
inproceedings,What Do Governments Plan in the Field of Artificial Intelligence? Analysing National AI Strategies Using NLP,"The primary goal of this paper is to explore how Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) can assist in reviewing, understanding, and drawing conclusions from text datasets. We explore NLP techniques for the analysis and the extraction of useful information from the text of twelve national strategies on artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, we are using a set of machine learning algorithms in order to (a) extract the most significant keywords and summarize each strategy document, (b) discover and assign topics to each document, and (c) cluster the strategies based on their pair-wise similarity. Using the results of the analysis, we discuss the findings and highlight critical issues that emerge from the national strategies for artificial intelligence, such as the importance of the data ecosystem for the development of AI, the increasing considerations about ethical and safety issues, as well as the growing ambition of many countries to lead in the AI race. Utilizing the LDA topic model, we were able to reveal the distributions of thematic sub-topics among the strategic documents. The topic modelling distributions were then used along with other document similarity measures as an input for the clustering of the strategic documents into groups. The results revealed three clusters of countries with a visible differentiation between the strategies of China and Japan on the one hand and the Scandinavian strategies (plus the German and the Luxemburgish) one on the other. The former promote technology and innovation-driven development plans in order to integrate AI with the economy, while the latter share a common view regarding the role of the public sector both as a promoter and investor but also as a user and beneficiary of AI, and give a higher priority to the ethical &amp; safety issues that are connected to the development of AI.","Papadopoulos, Theodoros and Charalabidis, Yannis","topic modelling, Automated Text Analysis, NLP, AI strategies, machine learning, document similarity",10.1145/3428502.3428514,2020,12

inproceedings,Imagining Artificial Intelligence Applications with People with Visual Disabilities Using Tactile Ideation,"There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.","Morrison, Cecily and Cutrell, Edward and Dhareshwar, Anupama and Doherty, Kevin and Thieme, Anja and Taylor, Alex","ai, design, accessibility, blind, artificial intelligence, multicultural, ideation, visually impaired",10.1145/3132525.3132530,2017,10

Predicting the impact, will allow us to pay more attention to those news that can affect people more, avoiding misinformation and fake news. However, the problem is that there is no way of predicting the impact that a press article can have. Therefore, the aim of this work is to implement a machine learning model that allows us to predict, with the best possible accuracy, the virality of online press articles (defining virality as the amount of clicks that an article receives when it is opened). In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which focuses on machine learning projects. The best obtained result corresponds to the model where the core of the architecture was based on BERT, a pre-trained model, which, for a pair of press articles headlines, predicted whether the first headline would be more viral than the second one. On the other hand, the evaluation was carried out by comparing the amount of clicks for a pair of articles. For a practitioner point of view, digital marketers can use our results to select the best words for their online marketing campaign. For a theoretical point of view, our results present an innovative natural language processing approach based on one of the best breed of Neural network models (BERT).","L.

inproceedings,Application Research of Basketball Physical Training Based on Artificial Intelligence,"The purpose of athletes playing basketball is to shoot and score. Basketball requires athletes to have the ability to quickly change offense and defense, and have strong physical fitness. Basketball is a combination of skills and physical fitness. Athletes who want to use superb skills flexibly in the game must have corresponding physical fitness. Physical fitness is the basic condition for athletes to play for a long time. With the continuous development of basketball, the confrontation intensity in the basketball game is becoming more and more fierce, and the physical fitness requirements of basketball players are getting higher and higher. This article first analyzes the current research status of basketball physical training, then studies the training process and specific characteristics of basketball physical training, and finally designs the experiment. Taking 4 basketball teams from 4 major colleges and universities in a certain city in China as the research object, through the four teams were randomly selected into a control group and an experimental group. The control group used the previous training method, and the experimental group used the new training method. After the experiment, the teams in the experimental group and the control group were tested on physical fitness indicators. The test results showed that the improvement of the experimental group's performance on all indicators was greater than that of the control group.","Liu, Yuanyuan and Wang, Shasha",,10.1145/3482632.3483005,2021,5
inproceedings,Exploring Why Underrepresented Students Are Less Likely to Study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,"There is little research on why underrepresented minorities are less likely to specifically study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). We surveyed 159 undergraduate students about their interest in, exposure to, and personal views on ML/AI in order to explore variations in responses by self-reported gender and race/ethnicity groups. We found that students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are ~6 times less likely to take a traditional ML/AI course than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity, but no significant difference was found between gender representation. Additionally, students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are more likely to report interest in social, cultural, and political impacts of ML/AI rather than the more technical aspects of ML/AI itself, which is a prevalent interest of students not underrepresented by race/ethnicity. We explore potential reasoning for this difference through further analysis of their survey responses. Encouragingly, we find that regardless of representational status 72.0% of students who report lack of interest in a traditional introductory course are interested in a ML/AI course that focuses more on the political, philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI and its impacts on society. Our findings suggest that a 'CS Principles"" style introductory ML/AI course, emphasizing social and political impacts, could be an effective way to promote diversity in ML/AI.","Barretto, Daphne and LaChance, Julienne and Burton, Emanuelle and Liao, Soohyun Nam","diversity, machine learning, underrepresented students, race and ethnicity, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3430665.3456332,2021,7
inproceedings,Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms,"Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.","Pandey, Akshat and Caliskan, Aylin","geolocation, prediction, disparate impact, AI ethics, algorithmic bias, price discrimination",10.1145/3461702.3462561,2021,12

inproceedings,An Artificial Intelligence Method for Digital Government Assessment: An Application of Neural Networks Analysis of a Ranking of Digital Government of Mexican States,"Development of accurate measurement systems to assess digital government advance is a critical topic of digital agenda of academia and governments around the world. There are several quantitative approaches such as rankings and indicators that have contributed to measure the progress of digital government initiatives in the public sector, but more sophisticated computational tools are usually unexploited. This article proposes a computational multi-parametric analysis of multiple metrics of digital government advance using a computational technique, the neural networks, for the analysis of the evolution of digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009-2015. Neural networks analysis has been used in different areas such as scientometric performance profiles, and disciplines like physics, chemistry, management, economics and demography. The neural networks analysis helps to identify clusters of characterizations that represents digital government advance patterns of performance. It also locates various profiles of digital government progress with similar patterns of performance and atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools. The results of this computational technique are robust showing that artificial intelligence tools are useful instruments to evaluate digital government advance overtime.","Villase\~{n}or-Garc\'{\i}a, E.

inproceedings,An Artificial Intelligence-Based Model-Driven Approach for Exposing off-Nominal Behaviors,"With an increase in the automation of cyber-physical systems (e.g., automated vehicles and robots), quality problems such as off-nominal behaviors (ONBs) have also increased. While there are techniques that can find ONBs at the requirements engineering stage as it reduces the cost of addressing defects early in development, they do not meet the current industrial needs and often ignore functional safety. These techniques suffer from limitations such as scalability, need for significant human effort and inability to detect overlooked or unknown ONBs. To address these limitations we need a technique that analyzes requirements with respect to functional safety, but with less human effort. To achieve this, we propose our artificial intelligence-based model-driven methodology that provides a means to find ONBs during requirements engineering with minimal human effort. Our methodology utilizes existing approaches such as causal component model (CCM) and systems theoretic process analysis (STPA). We describe the details of each step of our approach and how our approach would support finding ONBs. Using our research and the results of our studies, we intend to provide empirical evidence that considering ONBs during requirements engineering stage and analyzing requirements with respect to functional safety can help create more robust designs and higher-quality products.","Madala, Kaushik",,10.1109/ICSE-Companion.2019.00085,2019,4

inproceedings,Modelling Mobile Signal Strength by Combining Geospatial Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,"Estimating mobile signal strength accurately is a crucial task for network providers and their customers. However, current methodologies to estimate mobile signal strength present limitations in their practical implementation (i.e. physical based models), portability (i.e. spatial interpolation methods), simplicity and accuracy (i.e. path loss models). In this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of geospatial Big Data and advanced Artificial Intelligence to predict mobile signal strength at scale. Particularly, we used open access geo-spatial information about weather, tree coverage, land use, imperviousness, altitude and network infrastructure (i.e. a total of 174 features) to train and test uncertainty-aware artificial neural networks to predict mobile signal strength on data from the NetBravo crowdsourcing platform across all the United Kingdom (UK). Our model scored a best performance of 7.9 (standard deviation of 0.2) dBm for Root Mean Squared Error and 5.7 (standard deviation of 0.4) dBm for the Mean Absolute Error. Feature importance analysis showed that mobile cell tower characteristics and geospatial features showing the distribution of imperviousness and tree cover density over the line of sight between the mobile cell tower and the receiver as well as relative humidity were among the top 20 most important features.","Fraccaro, Paolo and Benatan, Matt and Reusch, Katharina and Fare, Clyde and Edwards, Blair and Pyzer-Knapp, Edward","Mobile Signal Strength, Geospatial, Big Data, Artificial Neural Networks Learning",10.1145/3448823.3448879,2021,5

However, choosing appropriate AI technologies to process real-time traffic data is an area that needs spotlighting. The aim of this paper is to discuss recent advancements in urban AIDSs based on AI techniques. We carried out a review for twelve previous AIDS study proposed since 2009. We compared these AIDSs in term of traffic data sources, input variables, and type of incident. Also, a comparison of simulators, techniques and the evaluation metrics has been used. The results indicated that hybrid AI techniques reported the best detection performances. In this context, fixed or fusion data sources were also given good results compared to others. This review shows reliable results of AI classification techniques applied in AIDS approaches. This finding urges to continue improve the performances of the proposed AI techniques. In future research, testing others AI techniques with smart technologies may increase the incident detection efficiency.","Samia, Hireche and Abdeslem, Dennai","inductive loop detectors, Urban automatic incident detection, floating car data, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3384544.3384557,2020,6
inproceedings,The Relationship of Higher Education Access with Final Marks in a Core Chemical Engineering Topic,"This present work cracks to understand the relationship between final marks in a topic with competences that are core of Chemical Engineering and students’ access grades to a Portuguese Higher Education Institution (HEI). The study is based on data gathered through a questionnaire concerning students’ perceptions about assessment and teaching-learning methodologies in four academic years (2016-2017 to 2019-2020). The student´s access grades were included in the questionnaire since 2018-19 academic year allowing to establish a relationship with the final marks obtained in a core Chemical Engineering Topic, Fluid Mechanics. From the analysis made, it can be said that students who obtained higher access grades to HEI may have also a higher Chemical Engineering curricular unit final mark, although the low linear relationship obtained (r =0.45) for the year 2019-20.","Sena-Esteves, M.

inproceedings,"Constructing the Mode of ""Four-in-One"" Software Engineering Master Training Based on Artificial Intelligence","Building a ""Four-in-One"" software engineering master's cultivation model based on artificial intelligence is an inevitable requirement of the development of the times and the realization of industrial development. However, due to the outdated cultivation mode of the Master of Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering, there are few or no courses related to artificial intelligence in terms of curriculum setting, and the textbooks are not updated in time, which makes students lack of grasp of cutting-edge knowledge and scientific research methods. In terms of scientific research practice, it is simple in form and low in technology content, which leads to the insufficiency of students' comprehensive engineering application ability, and becomes the bottleneck of the cultivation of senior talents in software engineering under the background of artificial intelligence. With four modules of scientific selection system, multi-module curriculum system, practical training system and school-enterprise cooperation mechanism, the ""Four-in-One"" training mode is constructed to cultivate high-level, open, compound and international software talents.","Duan, Yuanpeng and Gong, Weixin",,10.1145/3495018.3495332,2022,4

inproceedings,Preconceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Their Change through Co-Constructed Explorations,"Most explainable AI (XAI) approaches focus on mathematically correct and complete explanations. In contrast to that, everyday explanations are social practices that are influenced by many factors, e.g. the social and institutional context of the explanation. Everyday explanations are therefore co-constructed by both the explainer and the explainee. Assuming that everyday co-constructed explanations are easy to understand for citizens, they can help to make AI understandable for people who do not have affinity for technology. In this context, concrete and simplified examples that are adapted to the needs of the learner can reduce the complexity of the explanation furthermore. This Ph.D. project investigates the effects of co-constructed explanations created while exploring notional machines on the mental models of AI of everyday people. The goal is to identify aspects of AI technology which are relevant for everyone, to empower people to become a responsible and active members of society in a digitalized world where AI technology is ubiqitious.","Lenke, Michael",,10.1145/3488042.3490511,2021,2

inproceedings,Towards Accountability in the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Public Administrations,"We argue that the phenomena of distributed responsibility, induced acceptance, and acceptance through ignorance constitute instances of imperfect delegation when tasks are delegated to computationally-driven systems. Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.","Loi, Michele and Spielkamp, Matthias","artificial intelligence, public administrations, accountability, AI guidelines",10.1145/3461702.3462631,2021,10

inproceedings,Toward Non-Intuition-Based Machine and Artificial Intelligence Ethics: A Deontological Approach Based on Modal Logic,"We propose a deontological approach to machine (or AI) ethics that avoids some weaknesses of an intuition-based system, such as that of Anderson and Anderson. In particular, it has no need to deal with conflicting intuitions, and it yields a more satisfactory account of when autonomy should be respected. We begin with a ""dual standpoint'' theory of action that regards actions as grounded in reasons and therefore as having a conditional form that is suited to machine instructions. We then derive ethical principles based on formal properties that the reasons must exhibit to be coherent, and formulate the principles using quantified modal logic. We conclude that deontology not only provides a more satisfactory basis for machine ethics but endows the machine with an ability to explain its actions, thus contributing to transparency in AI.","Hooker, John N. and Kim, Tae Wan N.","modal logic, explainable ai, deontology, machine ethics, autonomous machine ethics, kantian ai, artificial intelligence ethics, accountable ai",10.1145/3278721.3278753,2018,7

A similar degree of change applies to market dynamics, volatile customer requirements, shortened product lifecycles and the amounts of environmental uncertainties in the context of organisational innovation management. Strategic Foresight (SF) offers an approach to deal with environmental uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has huge potential to support SF by means of collecting and analysing data as well as automatizing information research and analysis tasks. The current paper analyses the potentials and organisational practices at the nexus of AI and SF. In the form of expert interviews, current practices and expected future application potentials of AI in SF are analysed. Furthermore, challenges and potential weaknesses of AI in this context are discussed and an outlook on potential future visions of AI in SF from practitioners’ points of view is provided. The results show that currently AI is only applied in a very limited way to support SF, mostly in terms of supporting trend and customer data analysis. However, the results also indicate high future potentials of AI in SF. Experts agree that AI will have a high impact on SF, mainly in terms of automatizing information research and data analysis tasks and subsequently allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks in SF which require human abilities like intuition, creativity, courage and entrepreneurial thinking.t.","Brandtner, Patrick and Mates, Marius","Artificial Intelligence, Corporate Foresight, Innovation Management, Strategic Foresight, Data Analytics, Digitalization",10.1145/3481127.3481177,2021,7

Thus, this study aims to address the opinion of subscribers about newspaper coverage on AI and manpower issues. This study employs two approaches, quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results of quantitative analysis on topic model point to three frames, namely, humanity, society, and robotics. The study then applied these frames as the basis of qualitative analysis. Subscribers are mainly concerned about a lack of humanity and the violation of human dignity due to the implementation of AI. Additionally, subscribers discussed the manner, in which AI is changing the meaning of work. In terms of robotics, opinions were clearly polarized into positive and negative: Positive points mainly viewed the benefits of robots, such as addressing the shortage in labors, eliminating heavy labor, becoming friends with human beings, among others. Conversely, the negative opinions mainly associated with the fear against robots. This study suggested that the government needs to utilize means of implementation to mitigate the user's sense of aversion against AI. Additionally, the government needs to delineate the future society toward co-existence and cooperation between machine and humans.","Nagano, Aki","Artificial Intelligence, public opinion, topic model, newspaper coverages, Manpower issues",10.1145/3560107.3560137,2022,6

inproceedings,Eliminating Artificial-Natural Dichotomy A Formal Study on a Core Cognitive Process in Artificial Intelligence,"The core of this paper is to provide a framework for analyzing the naturalness and artificiality in terms of the new rising of square of opposition, which have fruitful results in doing conceptual analysis in many different disciplines. In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\""{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.","Chen, Shih-Hsun and Fu, Tzu-Keng","Artificial Intelligence, Emer-gentism, Square of Opposition, Logical Hexagon, Aristotle's Logic",10.1145/3080845.3080866,2017,6
inproceedings,A Redhead Walks into a Bar: Experiences of Writing Fiction with Artificial Intelligence,"Human creativity has been often aided and supported by artificial tools, spanning traditional tools such as ideation cards, pens, and paper, to computed and software. Tools for creativity are increasingly using artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report on two progressive – not comparative – autoethnographic studies to attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator.","Ghajargar, Maliheh and Bardzell, Jeffrey and Lagerkvist, Love","Storytelling, Creative writing, Artificial creativity, GPT-3, Creativity tool, AI co-creativity",10.1145/3569219.3569418,2022,12

article,Blending Human and Artificial Intelligence to Support Autistic Children’s Social Communication Skills,"This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.","Porayska-Pomsta, Ka\'{s}ka and Alcorn, Alyssa M. and Avramides, Katerina and Beale, Sandra and Bernardini, Sara and Foster, Mary Ellen and Frauenberger, Christopher and Good, Judith and Guldberg, Karen and Keay-Bright, Wendy and Kossyvaki, Lila and Lemon, Oliver and Mademtzi, Marilena and Menzies, Rachel and Pain, Helen and Rajendran, Gnanathusharan and Waller, Annalu and Wass, Sam and Smith, Tim J.","neurodiversity, intelligent learning environments, artificially intelligent agent, Autism, social communication",10.1145/3271484,2018,35

inproceedings,Investigation and Research on the Cultivation of Students' English Interests under Artificial Intelligence Technology,"With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence, there are abundant types of learning resources and various learning methods. The use of digital resources in the context of the Internet in learning can stimulate students’ interest in English learning, improve their English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and effectively improve the efficiency of junior high school English classroom learning. Different people have different learning effects in the same learning environment because their own qualities are certainly one factor, and the more important factor is the different attitudes of the learners, that is, whether the learners are interested in learning. Interest can arouse students’ curiosity and eager thirst for knowledge, and interest can promote students’ active learning, spontaneous learning, and diligent learning more than intelligence and skills. For the English learning of junior high school students, interest is the first condition for them to learn English well. Only when students are interested in English learning, can they actively participate in English learning, and gradually become more and more interested in the specific English learning process. Through the questionnaire survey of middle school students, we can understand their tendency to attribute to English learning performance in the process of English learning. This paper aims to investigate whether middle school students are more interested in English, the higher their English scores will be, and whether male and female students are different in their interest in English. In this way, in the process of English teaching, attribution theory can be used to combine students' reality and their own experience to guide and train students in attribution so that they can form correct attributions. At the same time, this paper has a certain guiding role for workers engaged in English education for middle school students. It can help them understand the attribution tendency of middle school students in the process of English learning and give middle school students correct attribution guidance and training, thus improving teachers’ English teaching performance.","Lin, Lin",,10.1145/3495018.3495342,2022,6

Over the last decade, a rather large number of maturity models have been suggested for different aspects (such as type of technology or considered processes) and in relation to different industries. Usually, these models are based on a number of assumptions such as the data used for the assessment, the mathematical formulation of the model and various parameters such as weights or importance indicators. Empirical evidence for such assumptions is usually lacking. We investigate the potential of using data from assessments over time and for similar institutions for the ML of respective models. Related concepts are worked out in some details and for some types of maturity assessment models, a possible application of the concept is discussed.","Hanne, Thomas and Gachnang, Phillip and Gatziu Grivas, Stella and Kirecci, Ilyas and Schmitter, Paul",,10.1145/3556089.3556102,2022,5

inproceedings,Designing Children’s New Learning Partner: Collaborative Artificial Intelligence for Learning to Solve the Rubik’s Cube,"Developing the problem solving skills of children is a challenging problem that is crucial for the future of our society. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.","Agostinelli, Forest and Mavalankar, Mihir and Khandelwal, Vedant and Tang, Hengtao and Wu, Dezhi and Berry, Barnett and Srivastava, Biplav and Sheth, Amit and Irvin, Matthew","Rubik’s cube, deep learning, explainability, reinforcement learning",10.1145/3459990.3465175,2021,5

inproceedings,Establishment and Design of English Translation Memory and Terminology Database Based on Artificial Intelligence,"In the application field of professional translation and localization market, since the quality of computer translation basically meets actual needs, most of the translation products that can be sold in the market use computer-assisted translation technology. However, due to the complexity and variability of linguistic knowledge, some people have proposed translation memory, which makes full use of the powerful functions of files and databases to improve the reliability and reuse of existing translation materials. Therefore, in some professional translation technology applications with high data and repetitiveness, the use of this type of technology can effectively eliminate the double operation of translators, avoid multiple translation results of the same word or two words, and significantly improve its work efficiency. This article is based on artificial intelligence-based English translation memory and terminology establishment and design. First of all, it uses literature research to explain the functions of English translation memory technology and English translation screening methods. After analyzing the memory and terminology, according to analyzing the results of the design of the memory bank and the design library, this article locates the granularity of the memory bank at the simple sentence level, and establishes a correspondence between the various components of a sentence based on the establishment of a simple word-sentence alignment. The English sentence similarity algorithm based on syntax and semantics can well measure the structural and semantic similarity between two English sentences, and can correctly return the most similar example sentences in a memory bank. After we obtained the most similar example sentences, we translated them according to the corresponding relationship between the sentence to be translated and the various components of the most similar example sentences.","Chen, Chen",,10.1145/3482632.3483146,2021,5

inproceedings,Ethical Implementation of Artificial Intelligence to Select Embryos in In Vitro Fertilization,"AI has the potential to revolutionize many areas of healthcare. Radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology are some of the areas most likely to be impacted in the near future, and they have received significant attention from the broader research community. But AI techniques are now also starting to be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF), in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but must be done carefully and transparently, as the ethical issues are significant, in part because this field involves creating new people. We first give a brief introduction to IVF and review the use of AI for embryo selection. We discuss concerns with the interpretation of the reported results from scientific and practical perspectives. We then consider the broader ethical issues involved. We discuss in detail the problems that result from the use of black-box methods in this context and advocate strongly for the use of interpretable models. Importantly, there have been no published trials of clinical effectiveness, a problem in both the AI and IVF communities, and we therefore argue that clinical implementation at this point would be premature. Finally, we discuss ways for the broader AI community to become involved to ensure scientifically sound and ethically responsible development of AI in IVF.","Afnan, Michael Anis Mihdi and Rudin, Cynthia and Conitzer, Vincent and Savulescu, Julian and Mishra, Abhishek and Liu, Yanhe and Afnan, Masoud","AI, ethics, randomised controlled trials, artificial intelligence, RCT, interpretable, embryo selection, machine learning, in vitro fertilization, black-box, IVF",10.1145/3461702.3462589,2021,11

inproceedings,Analysis on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Global Value Chain Upgrade of Manufacturing Enterprises,"Since the reform and opening up, Chinese manufacturing enterprises have actively participated in the global value chain division of labor, and their international competitiveness has been continuously strengthened. However, due to the lack of core technologies and market channels, manufacturing enterprises are still at the low end of the global value chain. Artificial intelligence can be deeply integrated with manufacturing enterprises by combining with Internet big data technology. It can promote the global value chain upgrade of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Based on this background, this paper first analyzes the reasons for the low-end locking of the value chain of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, which are due to the locking of comparative advantage, foreign technology and brand market. Then, this paper combs the theoretical mechanism of artificial intelligence promoting the upgrading of global value chain of manufacturing enterprises. Artificial intelligence can upgrade the global value chain by reducing the production cost of manufacturing enterprises, improving the effect of technological innovation and the efficiency of information circulation.

inproceedings,A Meta-Analysis of the Utility of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Human-AI Decision-Making,"Research in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making is experiencing tremendous growth with a constantly rising number of studies evaluating the effect of AI with and without techniques from the field of explainable AI (XAI) on human decision-making performance. However, as tasks and experimental setups vary due to different objectives, some studies report improved user decision-making performance through XAI, while others report only negligible effects. Therefore, in this article, we present an initial synthesis of existing research on XAI studies using a statistical meta-analysis to derive implications across existing research. We observe a statistically positive impact of XAI on users' performance. Additionally, the first results indicate that human-AI decision-making tends to yield better task performance on text data. However, we find no effect of explanations on users' performance compared to sole AI predictions. Our initial synthesis gives rise to future research investigating the underlying causes and contributes to further developing algorithms that effectively benefit human decision-makers by providing meaningful explanations.","Schemmer, Max and Hemmer, Patrick and Nitsche, Maximilian and K\""{u}hl, Niklas and V\""{o}ssing, Michael","empirical studies, meta-analysis, decision-making, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3514094.3534128,2022,10
inproceedings,Analysis of the Expansion of the Panama Canal Using Simulation Modeling and Artificial Intelligence,"This paper presents preliminary analysis of the Panama Canal Expansion from the viewpoint of salinity in the Gatun Lake and the utilization of neural networks. This analysis utilized simulation modeling and artificial intelligence. We have built several discrete and system dynamics simulation models of the current Panama Canal operations and the future expansion which have been validated with historical and projected data and Turing/expert validation by engineers of the Panama Canal Authority. The simulation models have been exercised in order to generate enough information about the future expansion. This information has been used to develop neural networks that have the capability to indicate the volume of the Gatun Lake and its respective salinity taking into consideration lockages, spillovers, hydropower generation, fresh water supply volumes, and environmental factors such as precipitation, tides, and evaporation. Support vector machines were used to build time series regression models of the evaporation of Gatun Lake.","Rabelo, Luis and Cruz, Liliana and Bhide, Sayli and Joledo, Oloruntomi and Pastrana, John and Xanthopoulos, Petros",,,2014,12

inproceedings,A Survey of Application of Artificial Intelligence Method in Text Emotion Analysis,"Human emotion analysis is a very extensive research field, which can be realized by a variety of applications. To engage in any project related to emotion detection, you must collect available models, data sets, and performance statistics related to it. The purpose of this review analysis is to integrate a unique and advanced set of methods proposed and/or implemented by everyone in the field. The research work of this paper mainly focuses on two aspects of classification, one is the classification based on research objects, the other is the classification based on research methods. The research object is mainly the difference between short text and normal text. The research methods mainly focus on machine learning, such as deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It can be seen from the comparison results that depth learning training is the best at a specific number of layers. If the number of layers is too many or too few, it will lead to insufficient accuracy or a waste of training time. Finally, this paper also puts forward feasible future research directions to provide readers with reference.","Lou, Xiang","Machine learning, Deep belief network, Recursive neural network, Emotion analysis, Convolutional neural networks, Support vector machine",10.1145/3497623.3497675,2022,6

inproceedings,Local Wisdom-Based Scientific Writing Skills in Indonesian Language General Course in Higher Education,"Scientific writing is one of the most difficult linguistic abilities to master. Many individuals find it difficult to master writing skills. This study aims to facilitate students in writing scientific papers. The ability to write scientific papers is one of the skills that every student should develop since it will help them complete their final assignment. As a result, a lecturer should produce scholars with exceptional academic knowledge as well as powerful and clever personalities. This is a preliminary study of the current situation. In the learning process of the Indonesian Language general course, a qualitative method was employed to enhance students' scientific writing skills. The research data were the students’ writing, which includes rational and empirical data. It can be solved by combining learning with local wisdom in scientific paper writing to encourage students to develop their scientific writing skills and understanding of text structures precisely. This study also aims to enhance scientific writing skills by incorporating students in independent research as part of a lesson plan. Based on the findings, this method has proven to be effective in improving students' scientific writing skills, so it needs to continue to be developed in the general course of Indonesian Language learning and is expected to be the right alternative for the lecturers to develop professional skills.","Suprihatin, Dewi and Winarni, Retno and Saddhono, Kundharu and Eko Wardani, Nugraheni",,10.1145/3516875.3516895,2022,5
inproceedings,Towards Smarter Public Budgeting? Understanding the Potential of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Support Decision Making in Government,"The use of artificial intelligence in government and its implications to society have generated widespread interest from research and practice communities. However, the analysis of artificial intelligence techniques as a tool to support government decision-making in specific functions is still scarce. For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.","Valle-Cruz, David and Gil-Garcia, J.

inproceedings,"Introducing Software Development Process, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence in a CS0.5 Course Project","Our CS0.5 course is required for all students and tasked to develop and assess the system development process proficiencies of an engineering-based institutional outcome. To achieve this tasking, we created a course-wide project that simulates NASA's Mars Ingenuity helicopter using an approach that emphasized our software system development process. With this project, our first-year college students created a 2-dimensional simulation of the Ingenuity helicopter flying through the thin Martian atmosphere with the goal of maximizing the area mapped subject to flight dynamics, available battery, landing proximity, and impact constraints. Students created their Ingenuity simulator using Python in three spirals: Spiral 1 - rendering of the simulation view with some initial movement, Spiral 2 - manual flight operations via thrust and roll keyboard inputs, and Spiral 3 - full auto-pilot. The students utilized a software system development process called ""UDIT"" (pronounced, ""U Did IT"") which stands for Understand - Design - Implement - Test. The assignment document was purposefully organized based on this process. The Understand and Design steps were presented via storyboards, enumerated requirements, a recommended structure chart, pseudocode, and suggested variables. As the Understand and Design steps address higher order objectives on Bloom's Taxonomy, we strived to model effective approaches for these steps. Most of our novice programmer's efforts involved the Implementation and Test steps emphasizing a build-a-little, test-a-little strategy. Forty percent of points come from testing via test procedures that the students created. The remaining points were earned based on code correctness and quality. The course also introduced the students to Artificial Intelligence to contribute to another proficiency of the engineering institutional outcome. For this, the project introduced students to genetic algorithms. They learned how the algorithm's parameters can be configured to train a more sophisticated version of the autopilot that needed to deal with additional Ingenuity features, including altitude-dependent mapping, as well as randomness in the form of varying winds at different altitudes. Currently being used with 450 students across 22 sections, the project is being assessed by sub-score tracking across the spirals; students' self-assessments of learning, interest, and self-efficacy; and collection of instructors' experiences and perceptions on the project.","Hadfield, Steven M. and Roosma, Alexander C. and de Freitas, Adrian A. and Braun, Kimberly A. and Fulton, Steven P. and Coffman, Joel and Merritt, David T. and Sample, Kenneth R. and Wilson, Justin C. and Birrer, Bobby D.",,10.1145/3502717.3532135,2022,1

Despite thumbnails' omnipresence and their assumed effect on sales, they largely constitute a black box for research and practice. This work aims to fill this gap and asks, with regard to hedonic information goods: What is the role of thumbnails in the purchase process and how and why do their basic, conceptual and social features impact sales? To answer the question, we first analytically and empirically show that thumbnails play a more central role in the purchase process for hedonic information goods than for other types of goods. Next, we develop a variance model on how and why thumbnails affect sales. Using artificial intelligence imagery analysis, we test the model against evidence from sales data of 100,000 hedonic information goods from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings entail theoretical contributions to the growing field of consumers' visual information processing in e-commerce contexts and lead us to implications for managerial practice.","Cremer, Stefan and Ma, Alice Kyungran","artificial intelligence imagery analysis, visual perception, hedonic information goods, consumer choice",10.1145/3154943.3154950,2017,8

Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students’ perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops’ influence on student perceptions of Alexa’s intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students’ perceptions of Alexa’s friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.","Van Brummelen, Jessica and Tabunshchyk, Viktoriya and Heng, Tommy","AI education, child-agent interaction, conversational agents, pedagogical agent design, persona",10.1145/3459990.3460730,2021,9

article,"A Descriptive Analysis of Collective Intelligence Publications since 2000, and the Emerging Influence of Artificial Intelligence","Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research. We hope this analysis sheds more light on the dynamics of the CI ecosystem.","Berditchevskaia, Aleks and Maliaraki, Eirini and Stathoulopoulos, Konstantinos","descriptive analysis, artificial intelligence, crowdsourcing, Collective intelligence, bibliometrics",10.1177/26339137221107924,2022,12

Here, we compare the performance of two very different architectures: the commonly used Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the new generation of Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs), by running training benchmarks of common AI/ML models. We leverage the maturity of software stacks, and the ease of migration among these platforms to learn that performance and scaling are similar for both architectures. Exploring training parameters, such as batch size, however finds that owing to memory processing structures, IPUs run efficiently with smaller batch sizes, while GPUs benefit from large batch sizes to extract sufficient parallelism in neural network training and inference. This comes with different advantages and disadvantages as discussed in this paper.As such considerations of inference latency, inherent parallelism and model accuracy will play a role in researcher selection of these architectures.

article,AIDCOV: An Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model for Detection of COVID-19 from Chest Radiography Images,"As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow globally, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains the primary strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. In this study, an Artificial Intelligence model for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV) is developed to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependencies among features and improves model performance while an attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. We used several publicly available datasets of both computed tomography (CT) and X-ray modalities. The main public dataset for chest X-ray images contains 475 COVID-19 samples, 3949 samples from other viral/bacterial infections, and 1583 normal samples. Our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.4%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.8%, a specificity of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.8% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on that dataset. Using a large dataset of CT images, our model obtained mean cross-validation accuracy and sensitivity of 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Additionally, our interpretable model can distinguish subtle signs of infection within each radiography image. Assuming these results hold up in larger datasets obtained from a variety of patients over the world, AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19, prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers, and highlight the areas in the lungs that show signs of COVID-related damage.","Zokaeinikoo, Maryam and Kazemian, Pooyan and Mitra, Prasenjit and Kumara, Soundar","convolutional neural networks, chest X-ray, chest CT, COVID-19, attention, deep learning, pneumonia, transfer learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3466690,2021,20

inproceedings,A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Government and Its Potential from a Public Policy Perspective,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend being implemented in the public sector. Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.","Valle-Cruz, David and Alejandro Ruvalcaba-Gomez, Edgar and Sandoval-Almazan, Rodrigo and Ignacio Criado, J.","Public Policy, Government, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3325112.3325242,2019,9

inproceedings,Design and Implementation of Virtual Dance Training System under the Background of Artificial Intelligence Technology,"As a social dance, sports dance is a form of communication between countries, and it is also an art that cannot be replaced by language. Since it was introduced to China, the speed of development in China has been extremely rapid, and sports dance training institutions have gradually developed throughout the country. However, traditional dance learning and dance communication are basically restricted to dance classrooms, resulting in a limited range of communication, fewer objects to communicate, and excellent dance experience and dance resources cannot be shared, which is not conducive to the improvement of the personal level of dancers. Based on the above reasons, the research on dance training is of great significance. This article first introduces the current status of dance training, and then uses artificial intelligence technology to design and implement a virtual dance training system. Finally, a final test is conducted on the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system. The test results show the virtual dance training system designed in this paper.

inproceedings,Research on the Influencing Factors of User Trust Based on Artificial Intelligence Self Diagnosis System,"Artificial intelligence technology has gradually become an important auxiliary means for people to obtain medical consultation. However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust. At the end of this paper, some suggestions are put forward to design an interpretable and reliable intelligent self diagnosis system.","Li, Weiheng and Fan, Xiangmin and Zhu, He and Wu, Jingzheng and Teng, Dongxing","artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, user trust",10.1145/3393527.3393561,2020,6

inproceedings,Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Teach Artificial Intelligence with LearningML to 10-16-Year-Old Students,"The inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is increasingly highlighted by international organizations and governments around the world as a cornerstone to enable the adoption of AI in society. That is why we have developed LearningML, aiming to provide a platform that supports educators and students in the creation of hands-on AI projects, specifically based on machine learning techniques. In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online. In order to assess the AI knowledge we created a test that includes different kinds of questions based on previous investigations and publications - resulting in a reliable assessment instrument. Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments. In addition, researchers and educators can make use of the new instrument we provide to evaluate future educational interventions.","Rodr\'{\i}guez-Garc\'{\i}a, Juan David and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Robles, Gregorio","artificial intelligence, machine learning, assessment, computational thinking, K-12",10.1145/3408877.3432393,2021,7

article,Artificial Intelligence–based Computed Tomography Processing Framework for Surgical Telementoring of Congenital Heart Disease,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, accounting for one-third of all congenital birth defects. As with complicated intracardiac structural abnormalities, CHD is usually treated with surgical repair, and computed tomography (CT) is the main examination method for diagnosis of CHD and also provides anatomical information to surgeons. Currently, there exists a serious shortage of professional surgeons in developing countries. Compared with developed countries where large hospitals and cardiovascular disease centers have professional surgical teams with rich treatment experience, surgeons in developing countries and remote areas suffer from lack of professional surgical skills resulting with low surgical quality and high mortality. Recently, surgical telementoring has been popular to tackle the above problems, in which less-skilled surgeons can get real-time guidance from skilled surgeons remotely through audio and video transmission. However, there still exists difficulties in applying telementoring to CHD surgeries including high resource consumption on medical data transmission and storage, large image noise, and inconvenient and inefficient discussion between surgeons on CT. In this article, we proposed a framework with an image compression module, an image denoising module, and an image segmentation module based on CT images in CHD. We evaluated the above three modules and compared them with existing works, respectively, and the results show that our methods achieve much better performance. Furthermore, with 3D printing, VR technology, and 5G communications, our framework was successfully used in a real case study to treat a patient who needed surgical treatment.","Xie, Wen and Yao, Zeyang and Ji, Erchao and Qiu, Hailong and Chen, Zewen and Guo, Huiming and Zhuang, Jian and Jia, Qianjun and Huang, Meiping","Artificial intelligence, neural network, telementoring, computed tomography, congenital heart disease",10.1145/3457613,2021,24

Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.","Gil, Yolanda and Garijo, Daniel and Khider, Deborah and Knoblock, Craig A. and Ratnakar, Varun and Osorio, Maximiliano and Vargas, Hern\'{a}n and Pham, Minh and Pujara, Jay and Shbita, Basel and Vu, Binh and Chiang, Yao-Yi and Feldman, Dan and Lin, Yijun and Song, Hayley and Kumar, Vipin and Khandelwal, Ankush and Steinbach, Michael and Tayal, Kshitij and Xu, Shaoming and Pierce, Suzanne A. and Pearson, Lissa and Hardesty-Lewis, Daniel and Deelman, Ewa and Silva, Rafael Ferreira Da and Mayani, Rajiv and Kemanian, Armen R. and Shi, Yuning and Leonard, Lorne and Peckham, Scott and Stoica, Maria and Cobourn, Kelly and Zhang, Zeya and Duffy, Christopher and Shu, Lele","regional-level decision-making, Intelligent user interfaces, integrated modeling, model metadata, remote sensing data",10.1145/3453172,2021,49

inproceedings,The Effect of Message Framing and Timing on the Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence's Suggestion,"AI helps us make decisions in various domains such as healthcare, finance or entertainment (e.g. Netflix, IBM Watson and etc.). However, people's trust and acceptance of AI are highly susceptible to when and how the suggestion is presented. This study examined the role of the message framing and timing on acceptance when the performance of AI is stated. The study employed a 2 (message timing: before vs. after decision) x 3 (message framing: no information vs. negative framing vs. positive framing) between-subjects experiment where participants were told to solve the specific problem with AI in different conditions. The results showed that participants perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable and accepted it more when the performance is not stated than any information is provided and they perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable when the message is presented before the decision is made. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Kim, Taenyun and Song, Hayeon","artificial intelligence, framing effect, message timing, acceptance",10.1145/3334480.3383038,2020,8

inproceedings,Performance Evaluation of Viral Infection Diagnosis Using T-Cell Receptor Sequence and Artificial Intelligence,"The adaptive immune system expresses millions of different receptors that detect and fight pathogens encountered throughout life. These receptors are encoded by unique DNA sequences that allow immune cells to express millions of different receptors. High-throughput sequencing and analyses of immune cell receptor sequences present a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological responses to infections and to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Even after the infection is eliminated, pathogen-specific immune cells and their receptor sequences are present at higher frequencies than prior to infection, and their increase in frequency prevents secondary infections. As a result of their persistence in the body, they may be useful for diagnosing infections and evaluating vaccine efficacy as a stable biomarker. However, this process requires thorough analysis of massive datasets at an accuracy beyond traditional statistical tests to diagnose infectious statuses based on sequence analyses. Here we evaluate various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to measure the performance of the identification and diagnosis of specific viral infections or vaccination statuses using the publicly available mouse (monkeypox infection and smallpox vaccination) and human (cytomegalovirus serostatus) T-cell receptor sequenced datasets. Our intensive experiments hold the potential for effective screening of disease status, including recently encountered strains like the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Kosfeld, Tim and McMillan, Jonathan and DiPaolo, Richard J. and Hou, Jie and Ahn, Tae-Hyuk","diagnosis, deep learning, T-cell receptor sequencing, vaccination, machine learning, infectious disease",10.1145/3388440.3412420,2020,10
inproceedings,Algorithm Optimization Model of Trading Strategy Based on CEEMDAN-SE-LSTM and Artificial Intelligence,"The key challenges of the financial industry are the volatility and complexity of the stock market, so how to make optimal trading strategy to maximize the total profit in all market conditions has become an important issue to the professional researchers and investors. This paper describes a hybrid stock trading strategy model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm and sample entropy (SE), combined with LSTM, are used to construct the integrated prediction model, which has dramatically improved the forecast precision. On the premise of accurate prediction, the extreme value theory (EVT) is introduced to improve the predictive ability of dynamic value at risk (VaR), which can manage the risk of portfolio. To forecast stock trends, the approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to assign weights to related factors. The final trading decisions are made by establishing trading signals and scoring models. Based on models above, the integrated trading strategy model is constructed as an automated trading decision tool. Taking Gold and Crude oil as examples, the profit results are proved to be decent through trading simulations.","Zhang, Jingwen and Fan, Lei and Gu, Kaijie",,10.1145/3558819.3565218,2022,7

inproceedings,Note: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Build a Data Catalog and Support Research on the Sustainable Development Goals,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the framework adopted by the global community to encourage taking actions on the multiple challenges facing the world today to ensure environmental protection, health and well-being, and economic prosperity. This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDGs related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics. In this paper, we present the SDG Data Catalog, a global open-source database indexing SDG-related datasets, associated metadata, and research networks. We describe the construction of this catalog, which relies on state-of-the-art natural language processing models with human supervision. The catalog breaks down data silos and helps sustainability researchers navigate the data sea to initiate effective collaborations.","Spezzatti, Andy and Kheradmand, Elham and Gupta, Kartik and Peras, Marie and Zaminpeyma, Roxaneh","Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Open Data, Sustainable Development",10.1145/3530190.3534829,2022,6

Meanwhile, a lot of experimental cases show that people can finish 2 tasks at the same time if one is familiar with one task or by shifting the thinking quickly, thus ""multitasking"" is achieved. And intelligent interaction based on how the attention distribute has become one of the current development trends. According to 3 types of interactions based on the progressive decreasing of attention requirement, we provide a standardized definition to the interaction design, and extract the typical proposals. Attention is one factor when a user is thinking his/her preferred interaction. It is proved that, compared with the traditional ""undivided attention"", ""multitasking"" is more flexibility in dealing with problems. It is an essential thinking ability evolved for human to adapt to the development of science and technology and improve the social productivity.","Xuejiao, He","Distributive capacity, Attention, Intelligent interaction, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3366194.3366300,2019,4
inproceedings,A New Era towards More Engaging and Human-like Computer-Based Learning by Combining Personalisation and Artificial Intelligence Techniques,"Engagement of learners in computer-based tutoring constitutes an important feature that is sought by learning applications to maximise the educational effectiveness. Moreover, the recognition of human emotions in interactive computer-based learning applications has also been considered important although it had been overlooked for many years in the past. In view of these, dynamic personalisation and a variety of artificial intelligence techniques offer new perspectives, insights and realistic results in rendering computer-based learning more human-like and engaging than it has ever been before. This talk will present and discuss research challenges and effective approaches towards a new era of personalisation and human-like behaviour of computer-based learning software. I will review the research advancements on this topic that have been achieved in the software engineering lab of our department. In particular, the talk will focus on the automatic analysis of computer observations in computer-based learning that are collected, taking input from at least three modalities of interaction, namely the keyboard, camera and microphone in conjunction with contextual information and are then used to draw inferences about the users' cognitive status, reasoning, social classmate behaviour, preferences and emotions. In return, the tutoring content and the user interface is automatically adapted accordingly to address the individual user's needs by making appropriate recommendations and presenting adaptive guidance. Contextual information differs depending on the kind of computer- based learning applications. As such, a diversity of paradigms of fully developed and evaluated computer-based learning systems, in our lab, will be presented and discussed to exemplify the above research in the context of virtual reality educational games, social network learning, mobile learning and multi-modal stand-alone learning, based on the combination of cognitive theories about human reasoning and emotions, machine learning algorithms, decision making theories and fuzzy logic.

This paper proposes a detailed review of AI based building energy prediction methods particularly, multiple linear regression, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Regression. In addition to the previously listed methods, this paper will focus on ensemble prediction models used for building energy prediction. Ensemble models improve the prediction accuracy by integrating several prediction models. The principles, applications, advantages, and limitations of these AI based methods are elaborated in this paper. Additionally, future directions of the research on AI based building energy prediction methods are discussed.","Wang, Zeyu and Srinivasan, Ravi S.",,,2015,11
inproceedings,The Right Tool for The Job? Assessing the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Identifying Administrative Errors,"This article explores the extent to which machine learning can be used to detect administrative errors. It concentrates on administrative errors in unemployment insurance (UI) decisions, which give rise to a public values conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. This conflict is first described and then highlighted in the history of the US UI regime. Machine learning may not only mitigate this conflict but it may also help to combat fraud and reduce the backlog of claims associated with economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The article uses data about improper UI payments throughout the US from 2002 through 2018 to analyze the accuracy of random forests and deep learning models. We find that a random forest model using gradient descent boosting is more accurate, along several measures, than every deep learning model tested. This finding could be explained by the goodness-of-fit between the machine learning method and the available data. Alternatively, deep learning performance could be attenuated by necessary limits to publicly-accessible claims data.","Young, Matthew and Himmelreich, Johannes and Honcharov, Danylo and Soundarajan, Sucheta","AI, Administrative Errors, Public Administration, Social Policy, Unemployment Insurance",10.1145/3463677.3463714,2021,12
inproceedings,Too Bureaucratic to Flexibly Learn About AI? The Human-Centered Development of a MOOC on Artificial Intelligence in and for Public Administration,"The public sector holds enormous potential for the use of artificial intelligence, which is also recognized and supported by the government. To realize this potential, however, it is imperative that civil servants have the necessary knowledge to recognise and optimally exploit the application and utilisation possibilities of AI. Massive open online courses (MOOC) are a promising way to help civil servants gain that required knowledge. But how can such a course be designed to become accepted by this target group? In this paper, we present a human-centered development approach to develop a MOOC about AI for civil servants. Using an analysis of the target audience’s mental models, knowledge needs, and attitudes, we iteratively developed short learning units that ground the abstract AI topics in concrete case scenarios taken from the public sector. First results of an expert evaluation (expertise in adult education, public sector, and AI) look promising and further evaluations with the target group are planned.","Dhungel, Anna-Katharina and Wessel, Daniel and Zoubir, Mourad and Heine, Moreen","E-government, adult education, artificial intelligence, moocs, public sector, civil servants",10.1145/3473856.3473998,2021,5
inproceedings,Research on Online and Offline Mixed Teaching Model of Baking Course Based on OBE and Artificial Intelligence,"OBE theory plays an important guiding role in the teaching reform of practical courses. Taking students as the centre, we divide the baking course teaching into three stages: online learning before class, internalization and sublimation in class and consolidation and strengthening after class. The classroom reform based on OBE and AI is supported by the update of teaching environment, teaching design and teaching implementation, realizing the classroom innovation and talent training. We pay attention to students' professional technology and ability to make the teaching goal clearer. We conduct the whole process assessment and evaluation of students' achievements, which is helpful to cultivate professional and skilled talents. Practice has proved that the theoretical goal completion, practical goal completion and teaching mode satisfaction of the online and offline hybrid teaching mode of baking course based on OBE concept are higher than the corresponding indicators under the traditional model. The online and offline mixed teaching mode of baking course based on OBE theory can fully enhance learning interest and learning effect.","He, Siyun",,10.1145/3495018.3501174,2022,7

inproceedings,Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in Air Pollution Studies for the Prediction of Particulate Matter Concentration,"Statistical modeling has found not suitable to be used when predicting the particulate matter (PM10) as it is non-linear in nature. The complexity and nonlinearity of PM10 concentration in the atmosphere are known best captured by the nonlinear model which emerges nowadays such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN). In order to assess the capability of MLP-NN model in predicting the PM10 concentration, a statistical or traditional model known as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was also developed as a reference model. The daily air quality data and meteorological variables from the year 2010-2014 were assembled in developing the models. The MLP-NN model with the combination of logsig and purelin activation function revealed 75.5% of the variance in data with 6.59 μg/m3 (RMSE) and 88.0% of the variance in data with 6.30 μg/m3 (RMSE), during training and testing phase, respectively. The MLP-NN model improves by 61.5% and reducing the 62.2% error as compared to the MLR model.

inproceedings,Structural Damage Detection of a Concrete Based on the Autoregressive All-Pole Model Parameters and Artificial Intelligence Techniques,"Over the past few decades, damage identification in structural components has been the crucial concern in quality assessment and load capacity rating of infrastructure, as well as in the planning of a maintenance schedule. In this regard, structural health monitoring based on efficient tools to identify the damages in early stages has been focused by researchers to prevent sudden failure in structural components, ensure the public safety and reducing the asset management costs. Therefore, the development and application of sensing technologies and data analysis using machine learning approaches to enable the automatic detection of cracks have become very important. The purpose of this research is to develop a robust method for automatic condition assessment of real-life concrete structures for the detection of relatively small cracks at early stages. A damage identification approach is proposed using the parametric modeling and machine learning approaches to analyze the sensors data. The data obtained from transducers mounted on concrete beams under static loading in laboratory. These data are used as the input parameters. The method relies only on the measured time responses. After filtering and normalization of the data, Autoregressive all-pole model parameters (Yule-Walker method) are considered as features and used as the inputs of a newly developed Self-Advising Support Vector Machine (SA-SVM) for the classification purpose in civil Engineering area. Finally, the results are compared with traditional methods to investigate the feasibility of our proposed method. It is demonstrated that the presented method can reliably detect the crack in the structure and thereby enable the real-time infrastructure health monitoring.","Hoshyar, Azadeh Noori and Kharkovsky, Sergey and Taghavipour, Saber and Samali, Bijan and Liyanapathirana, Ranjith","Concrete, Support Vector Machine, Autoregressive all-pole model parameters, Self-Advising Support Vector Machine, parametric modeling, classification",10.1145/3163080.3163120,2017,5

inproceedings,Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Evidence-Based Decision Making in Government: Random Forest and Deep Neural Network Classification for Predicting Harmful Algal Blooms in New York State,"Advances in artificial intelligence techniques have shown tremendous potential as a decision support tool for government agencies. However, recent studies typically highlight the combination of large-scale datasets and high-performance computing technologies, which is frequently far away from the reality of many public agencies that still heavily rely on their legacy systems and labor-intensive practices. Using that non-ideal organizational and technical infrastructure, they have to face very complex problems and propose policy solutions. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of such problems. HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.","Choi, Yongjin and Gil-Garcia, Ramon and Aranay, Oguz and Burke, Brian and Werthmuller, Derek","deep neural network, harmful algal blooms, random forest, artificial intelligence, evidence based policy",10.1145/3463677.3463713,2021,11

inproceedings,AIMMX: Artificial Intelligence Model Metadata Extractor,"Despite all of the power that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models bring to applications, much of AI development is currently a fairly ad hoc process. Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. Our platform extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models.","Tsay, Jason and Braz, Alan and Hirzel, Martin and Shinnar, Avraham and Mummert, Todd","Machine Learning, Model Catalog, Model Mining, Artificial Intelligence, Model Metadata, Metadata Extraction",10.1145/3379597.3387448,2020,12
inproceedings,Teaching Modelling Literacy: An Artificial Intelligence Approach,"In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.","Saini, Rijul and Mussbacher, Gunter and Guo, Jin L.

inproceedings,Public Decision Making: Connecting Artificial Intelligence and Crowds,"The recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence, as well as the wide adoption of the wisdom of the crowd, also known as collective intelligence, across sectors, has received attention and excitement across disciplines. In addition to the scientific breakthrough, recent public sector studies recognize AI's potential contributions in public services, such as big data for decision making, the development of smart cities, and social and health care. Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature.

inproceedings,A Career in Organized Anarchy: Building Interpersonal Relationships in Higher Education,"Interpersonal relationships are a foundational tool for accomplishing objectives in any organizational context but play an even more important role in Higher Education environments than many others. This work explores the value of relationships as a purposeful technique for achieving goals when no established process exists, issues are complex, or resources are scarce - scenarios which are all too familiar in Information Technology. A brief literature review sets the stage for gaining a better understanding of what drives various college and university environments and their organizational behavior models. Bases of Power are addressed as an academic concept related to influence tactics and their expected outcomes. Coupling an understanding of Higher Education cultural settings, power, and influence tactics we will examine how university decisions are made, and practical methods for directing those decisions towards desired outcomes within IT and throughout the campus communities we support. The value of relationships as an influence technique is established and strategies for how and when to cultivate relationships are discussed as they pertain to staff in diverse roles, from front-line support to CIO. Washington University in St. Louis is provided throughout this work as an example of an ""Organized Anarchy"" behavioral model where many semi-autonomous units exist, and actions are many times only loosely coupled to results.","House, Matthew","relationships, acm proceedings, higher education administration, influence tactics, mentoring, organizational behavior, culture",10.1145/3235715.3235733,2018,9

inproceedings,"Values, Identity, and Social Translucence: Neurodiverse Student Teams in Higher Education","To successfully function within a team, students must develop a range of skills for communication, organization, and conflict resolution. For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence -- a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict. To support future design of technology for neurodiverse teams, we propose: (1) a design space and design concepts including collaborative and affective computing tools, and (2) extending Social Translucence to account for student and group identities.","Zolyomi, Annuska and Ross, Anne Spencer and Bhattacharya, Arpita and Milne, Lauren and Munson, Sean A.","autism, value-sensitive design, neurodiversity, collaboration",10.1145/3173574.3174073,2018,13

inproceedings,Ns3-Ai: Fostering Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Networking Research,"Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved its momentum in various areas such as image processing and natural language processing thanks to the advances in processing speed, data acquisition and storage. Many research efforts have been exerted to apply AI to computer networking. Performance evaluation of network systems using AI techniques can be conducted using ns-3, and such studies can be facilitated if ns-3 is able to interact with the existing open-source AI frameworks. In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework. This ns-3 extension module may foster the performance evaluation of AI algorithms in computer networking research with much reduced development workload.","Yin, Hao and Liu, Pengyu and Liu, Keshu and Cao, Liu and Zhang, Lytianyang and Gao, Yayu and Hei, Xiaojun","network simulation, AI, ns-3",10.1145/3389400.3389404,2020,8

inproceedings,XAI4FL: Enhancing Spectrum-Based Fault Localization with Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Manually finding the program unit (e.g., class, method, or statement) responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. A popular family of such techniques is spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), which takes program execution traces (spectra) of failed and passed test cases as input and applies a ranking formula to compute a suspiciousness score for each program unit. However, most existing SBFL techniques fail to consider two facts: 1) not all failed test cases contribute equally to a considered fault(s), and 2) program units collaboratively contribute to the failure/pass of each test case in different ways.In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Applying XAI to the failed test case, we retrieve information about which program statements within the test case that are considered the most important (i.e., have the biggest effect in making the test case failed). Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.We compare the performance of our approach against five popular SBFL techniques: DStar, Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and OP. We measure their performance using the Top-K and EXAM scores. In particular, we focus on the result of the Top-1, which importance has been highlighted in automated program repair domain, where the proposed methods often assume perfect fault localization (i.e., the fault must be found at the first rank of the suspiciousness list). Our results show that our approach, named XAI4FL, has a statistically significant and substantially better performance in terms of Top-1 than the SBFL approaches. We also compare our approach with a simpler approach to get feature importance in a tree-based model (i.e., using the Mean Decrease in Impurity method). Our results show that XAI4FL statistically significantly outperforms the MDI method in Top-K and EXAM score. Our results and findings highlight that the utilization of XAI for fault localization can improve the overall results of fault localization techniques.","Widyasari, Ratnadira and Prana, Gede Artha Azriadi and Haryono, Stefanus A. and Tian, Yuan and Zachiary, Hafil Noer and Lo, David","fault localization, model-agnostic explanation technique, testing and debugging, spectrum-based fault localization, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)",10.1145/3524610.3527902,2022,12

Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Freshmen in an Introductory Computer Science Course,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widely utilized, there is a need for non-computer scientists to understand 1) how the technology works, and 2) how it can impact their lives. Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.","de Freitas, Adrian A. and Weingart, Troy B.","machine learning, computer science education, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3408877.3432530,2021,7

However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.","Denisova, Alena and Cairns, Paul","immersion, player knowledge, player experience, adaptive artificial intelligence, biasing effects",10.1145/2793107.2793109,2015,11

However, the advent of such ""human-like"" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an ""other"" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change. It calls for a collaborative research effort from the HCI community to study and accommodate users for a future where they interact with algorithms, not just interfaces.","Oh, Changhoon and Lee, Taeyoung and Kim, Yoojung and Park, SoHyun and Kwon, Saebom and Suh, Bongwon","anthropomorphism, algorithm, algorithmic experience, alienation, artificial intelligence, technophobia",10.1145/3025453.3025539,2017,12

There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two.

The actors of this emergent practice are coming from contemporary art, media and digital arts. These artists have developed an original practice of AI within their creative field. In this article, we propose a qualitative study to explore the nature of this practice. We interviewed five internationally renowned artists about how AI is integrated into their work. Through a thematic analysis of the interviews, we first find that their practice relies on crafting algorithms and data as materials. We uncover how they explicitly use this material unpredictability rather than avoid it. Secondly, we highlight the politics of their practice that consist of resisting the culture of AI research, as well as its inherent power dynamics. We also highlight how their relationship with the technology is imbued with ethics and how they rethink their role with respect to the technology.

However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.","Lin, Kevin","identity, data structures, culturally responsive pedagogy, political vision, critical pedagogy, cultural competence, ethics, social justice",10.1145/3478431.3499291,2022,7

inproceedings,Regulating for 'Normal AI Accidents': Operational Lessons for the Responsible Governance of Artificial Intelligence Deployment,"New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such 'normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.","Maas, Matthijs M.","normal accident theory, ai and law, trust and explanations in ai systems, ethical design and development of ai systems",10.1145/3278721.3278766,2018,6

Despite widespread use and popularity, these repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique properties, development patterns, and trends.In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of AI &amp; ML Tool (700) and Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a characterization. While not the only platform hosting AI &amp; ML development, GitHub facilitates collecting a rich data set for each repository with high traceability between issues, commits, pull requests and users. To compare the AI &amp; ML community to the wider population of repositories, we also analyzed a set of 4,101 unrelated repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a repository. We've captured key insights of this community's 10 year history such as it's primary language (Python) and most popular repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI &amp; ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in future research.","Gonzalez, Danielle and Zimmermann, Thomas and Nagappan, Nachiappan","artificial intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, GitHub, mining software repositories, Open Source",10.1145/3379597.3387473,2020,12

inproceedings,"I Lead, You Help but Only with Enough Details: Understanding User Experience of Co-Creation with Artificial Intelligence","Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have increased the opportunities for users to interact with the technology. Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user--AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.","Oh, Changhoon and Song, Jungwoo and Choi, Jinhan and Kim, Seonghyeon and Lee, Sungwoo and Suh, Bongwon","human-ai interaction, artificial intelligence, human computer collaboration",10.1145/3173574.3174223,2018,13

Existing efforts have focused on the model fidelity, which however should not be the only concern. Due to the lack of adequate understanding and trust in the model, many accurate energy models have not been deployed in the real world. In this article, we introduce explainability and interpretability into the building energy model. We first use partial dependence plots to explain and quantify the importance of features at a fine-grained level and reveal different importance change patterns with different feature values. We also use a surrogate-based approach to interpret the internal mechanism and decision-making process of the model. We show that the local mechanism interpretation is feasible when the surrogate is both accurate and explainable. Explanation and interpretation are visualized, to provide system users with intuitive and informative insights with multi-disciplinary discussions. Our research promotes the operation and optimization of building energy systems and supports the widespread adoption of energy systems based on machine learning.","Zhang, Wei and Liu, Fang and Wen, Yonggang and Nee, Bernard","energy modelling, machine learning, explainable artificial intelligence, smart grid, smart buildings",10.1145/3486611.3491127,2021,4
inproceedings,Accelerating Public Service Delivery in India: Application of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.","Malhotra, Charru and Anand, Rashmi",,10.1145/3428502.3428510,2020,8
inproceedings,A Data Mining Approach for Student Referral Service of the Guidance Center: An Input in Designing Mediation Scheme for Higher Education Institutions of the Philippines,"The academic guidance office of an educational institution holds pertinent data of all the students in the institution such as psychological examination results, students' referral records and the like. Further, the office offered orientation services, testing services, counseling and follow-up services, individual inventory services, career guidance services, research &amp; evaluation services and placement services. In this paper, a data mining approach was used to produce a trend analysis through time series and forecasted data using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) of the student referral details from one of the Higher Education Institutions in the Philippines. Student referral historical data from the second semester of school year 2016- 2017, first semester of school year 2017-2018, second semester of school year 2017-2018 and the first semester of school year 2018- 2019 was used in the study. Results showed that absenteeism, poor attendance and poor academic performance were the highest number of recorded students' referrals over the others in which poor attendance yields a decreasing pattern among the three. On the other hand, based on the forecasted data, only poor academic performance and poor attendance showed a slight increasing patterns among others. These further signify that a proper program should be in place by the school counselors in mitigating the occurrence of referrals especially on the reasons showing an increase of prediction data.","Cabrera, Joey A. and Orong, Markdy Y. and Capio, Nelpa N. and Filarca, Arnel and Neri, Eden and Clarin, Ariel R.","ARIMA, Prediction, Moving Average, Time Series, GRETL",10.1145/3378936.3378958,2020,5

inproceedings,What Do You See? Evaluation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Interpretability through Neural Backdoors,"EXplainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret how a deep neural network predicts inputs through model saliency explanations that highlight the input parts deemed important to arrive at a decision for a specific target. However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region.

inproceedings,InuAid Chest X-Rays AI Product: Respiratory Diseases Detection Using Artificial Intelligence to Significantly Improve Productivity and Quality of Diagnosis,"The spread of Covid-19 virus around the world has taken many lives, quarantined people and shattered many industries. Due to high transmissibility of the virus and its silent incubation period in human beings, detection of the virus plays an important role to control its spread and to plan diagnostic and preventive measures. Laboratory tests such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) take more time and hence there is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to detect the virus to prevent its spread and combat it. Today PCR tests were used for diagnosing purposes and the chest x-ray was only used as the follow up of patients, hence these studies on the chest x-rays of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia or any other disease are still limited to the literature and must be improved in the future. In this project, the goal is to build an application for healthcare workers to monitor the health of lungs using the chest x-ray images of patients. The algorithm must be very accurate because it deals with the lives of people. Here we used computer vision and deep learning techniques in this project. The focus is to classify chest x-ray images and segment the abnormal region and to get more insights on the images from the available datasets. The diagnostic accuracy is the challenging part and to increase the detection efficiency due to the limited open-source data available. The data was collected from the internet. On classification, the trained model was able to achieve 93.10% accuracy and F1 Score of 0.93 after using transfer learning technique with pneumonia images. On segmentation, the Intersection Over Union value was found to be 0.91 on the validation data.","Kumar S.

inproceedings,From Temporary Shelter to Permanent Dwelling: Optimizing the Spatial Organization of Refugee Camps in Jordan through Artificial Intelligence,"Refugee camps are defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as “temporary facilities built to provide immediate protection and assistance to people who were forced to flee their homes due to war, persecution or violence”. The average lifespan of a refugee camp is seventeen years after which they organically transition into new towns. This paper uses Jordan as a case study, as it has been the country hosting the largest number of refugees since 1947. Daily practices by refugees subvert the initial planned camp into organic formations suitable for their changing needs, overriding the rigid built environment which no longer serves them. Addressing SDGs number 10: Reduced Inequalities, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 17: Partnerships of change, this ongoing research assesses the use of segmentation algorithms as a first step in identifying morphological patterns in the built environment and understanding transient scenarios of a refugee camp's spatial organization. By understanding patterns of spatial change, the inevitable transition from temporary to permanent settlement can be guided away from “slummification” and towards creating adequate low-income housing for refugees in Jordan.","Marji, Noor and Kohout, Michal",,10.1145/3569219.3569363,2022,5

inproceedings,Adaptive E-Learning: Adaptation of Content According to the Continuous Evolution of the Learner During His Training,"Higher education has always been based on a traditional education system. All learners have to attend all training courses without taking into consideration human and logistical constraints. This situation leads to major problems of massification, which unfortunately subsequently lead to problems of demotivation or even abandonment of a large number of students.A solution to these problems resides in introduction of distance learning. The implementation of online courses, such as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), and the emergence of educational platforms such as LMS (Learning Management System) or LCMS (Learning Content Management System), have made it possible to introduce the notion of e-learning into Higher education. Nevertheless, if e-learning has left the Stone Age elsewhere, it is still an emerging field in some countries as Morocco where it is far from having reached maturity. Like any new system or proposal, e-learning has its own detractors who need to be more reassured on certain aspects.In this article, we deal with some major issues related to e-learning platforms, which offer pre-established pedagogical content without really taking into account the particularity or evolution of each learner during the training path. We will therefore talk about a customised or adaptive e-learning.

inproceedings,An Elephant in the Learning Analytics Room: The Obligation to Act,"As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.","Prinsloo, Paul and Slade, Sharon","learning analytics, obligation to act ethics",10.1145/3027385.3027406,2017,10
article,Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education: Unsupervised Topic Modeling Analysis of Global AI Curricula,"The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is not new, with discussions going back at least 40 years. Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom’s taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how.

With the continuous advancement of university education reform, student information presents the characteristics of wide source, fast change and difficult maintenance. This paper mainly studies the application analysis of artificial intelligence technology in university student affairs management. In system building, not only business thinking should be separated, but also the process of business analysis should be transformed into the process of system building. By sorting out the data items of student information, the data model is established. By establishing and expanding the business association between data items, the standardization and knowledge-based management of student information can be realized. On this basis, relevant artificial intelligence technology is introduced to help student staff analyze data, arrange work, and find problems and so on.","Yang, Hui",,10.1145/3495018.3495508,2022,5

article,AI Education Matters: A First Introduction to Modeling and Learning Using the Data Science Workflow,"Traditionally artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses are taught at the senior and graduate level in higher-education computer science curricula following the mastery learning strategy, cf. Figure 1. This makes sense, since most AI and ML models and the theory behind them require a substantial understanding of probability and statistics, as well as advanced calculus and matrix algebra. To understand Logistic Regression as a probabilistic classifier performing maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation, for example, students need to understand joint and conditional probability distributions. In order to derive the back propagation algorithm to train Neural Networks students need to understand partial derivatives and inner and outer tensor products. These are just two of many examples where substantial mathematical background - typically taught at the junior level in a computer science major program - is required. With AI and ML algorithms being used more widely by enterprises across domains, as well as, in applications and services we use in our daily lives, it makes sense to raise awareness about what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how it is used to solve problems to a broader audience. Very much in the same spirit as the ""CS for all"" idea (https://www.csforall.org), we have to extend our curricula to include introductory courses to AI and ML on the early undergraduate level (or even in high-school) to expose students to the ideas and working principles of AI technology. One way to achieve this is to introduce the principles of working with data, modeling, and learning through the data science workflow.","Neumann, Marion",,10.1145/3362077.3362083,2019,4

inproceedings,An Intelligent Tool for Combatting Contract Cheating Behaviour by Facilitating Scalable Student-Tutor Discussions,"With the global increase in demand for online tertiary education, teachers are facing unique challenges in scaling assessment activities and meaningful student engagement. One such aspect is contract cheating behaviours exhibited in the modern online environment --- posing a threat to the academic integrity of tertiary education. These obstacles amplify when applied to traditionally difficult domains like introductory programming education. Prior research on contract cheating identification proposes that while challenging, techniques such as developing strong teacher-student relationships, and real-time discussions may lead to instances of identifying contract cheating behaviours. The proposition, then, is to scale real-time, student-teacher discussions with large, online cohorts --- similar to those discussions which traditionally took place in the classroom.

inproceedings,Analysis of the Influence of Education APP on the Independent Learning Mode of Junior Middle School Students,"In the context of the era of artificial intelligence, mobile learning methods are increasingly popular. Through literature research, it is found that with the deepening of subject research, more and more researchers have begun to explore the impact of mobile learning methods on disciplines, teacher teaching, teacher evaluation, etc., while exploring the educational APP for students' independent learning methods. The field research of influence is scarce. With the maturity of mobile learning technology, education APP occupies the main force of the mobile application market, and students' learning styles tend to diversify. As an auxiliary tool for education and teaching, APP helps students to acquire more extracurricular learning resources, and it also influences students' independent learning methods. Therefore, this paper uses the method of comparative analysis to analyze the influence of educational APP on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and clearly concludes that education APP has a certain impact on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and deeply analyzes its influence on junior high school students. The factors of self-learning are followed by suggestions for management from software developers, managers, teachers and parents.

inproceedings,Intelligent Robot for Early Childhood Education,"The paper introduces a preschool robot with a face tracking module based on the application of artificial intelligence in early childhood education. The face recognition function based on the convolutional neural network and k-Nearest Neighbor classification method allows the early childhood robot to recognize a specified face. The two-degree-of-freedom PTZ can be automatically adjusted based on the PID (proportion-integralderivative) control to track a face. Preschool robots actively interact with young children and send their video information to parents in real-time, effectively establishing a communication bridge between the family and the campus. Because the preschool robot can track the specified face ID and send the video information directly to the parents, this avoids the wrong tracking of non-children and protects privacy to a large extent.","Dongming, Li and Wanjing, Li and Shuang, Chen and Shuying, Zhao","home-school connection, active interaction, face tracking, preschool robot, intelligent education",10.1145/3395245.3396420,2020,5

For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future.Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics.

inproceedings,A Contextualized Project-Based Approach for Improving Student Engagement and Learning in AI Courses,"Project MLeXAI, Machine Learning Experiences in Artificial Intelligence, is a multi-institutional project that has been funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The goal is to develop a framework for teaching core Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics with a unifying theme of machine learning. The objectives are to enhance student learning experiences in the AI course by implementing a unifying theme of machine learning to tie together the diverse and seemingly disconnected topics in the AI course, to increase student interest and motivation to learn AI, and to introduce students to an increasingly important research area. To that end, a suite of hands-on term-long projects and associated curricular modules have been developed. Each project involves the design and implementation of a learning system which enhances a particular commonly-deployed AI application. In addition, the projects provide students with an opportunity to address not only core AI topics but also many of the issues central to computer science, including algorithmic complexity and scalability problems.Phase I of the project involved the development and testing of a prototype at three institutions: a small liberal arts college, a medium comprehensive university, and a state university. Phase II builds on phase I work and involves further development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI through a unifying theme of machine learning. The goal of phase II was to increase the number of modules and expand the implementation and testing to include a larger and more diverse set of colleges and universities.In this paper we present results of phase II assessment of the collaborative development, dissemination, and separate testing of the projects at the institutions of twenty participating faculty members. The institutions are geographically dispersed and represent a broad range of institutions and student body.","Russell, Ingrid and Coleman, Susan and Markov, Zdravko",,10.1145/2421277.2421278,2012,7

inproceedings,Actualization of Environmental Education as an Innovative and Digital Resource for Sustainable Regional Development,"The scientific and expert community does not fully explore such a factor of sustainable regional development as actualization of environmental education. The goal of this research is to develop a list of prospective majors in the higher education system for solving current ecological challenges ensuring stable regional development. We have made a predictive assessment of the demand for prospective majors in environmental science, which is not limited to the study of the need for such personnel strictly in the labor market. A number of factors that influence people's preferences when choosing promising areas of environmental education was taken into account, such as: the industry development in the field of renewable energy; the worldwide search for a waste-free model of plastic recycling; the global scientific, technological and innovative character of regional economy development, etc. The results of this study are based on expert opinions from the environmentally-oriented scientific community and employers in the Tula region, who took part in the online survey through questionnaires. The opinion of rectors of leading universities, as well as their staff and students, on the functioning of the higher education system in the area of environmental science considering its actualization was of no less importance. The results obtained include a list of recommended majors in the field of environmental science, capable of utilizing their digital competencies and skills in solving current environmental problems; trending activities in the field of environmental development and protection, which will be in demand in the economy of the future for the sustainable development of Russian regions.","Griazev, Mikhail and Sabinina, Anna and Sycheva, Irina and Izmalkova, Svetlana and Sycheva, Natalia","Region, Environmental education, Sustainable development, Environmental problems, Innovative and digital resource, Actualization",10.1145/3444465.3444474,2021,7
inproceedings,Forecasting Learner Attrition for Student Success at a South African University,In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students’ risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students’ risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student’s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions. This work will benefit academic developers and staff who provide support to students who are at academic risk of completing their undergraduate Science programmes.,"Ajoodha, Ritesh and Jadhav, Ashwini and Dukhan, Shalini","Pre-college or schooling, South Africa, Biographical characteristics, Identifying at-risk biographical profiles, Background features, Individual attributes, Bayesian analysis, Model-based machine learning",10.1145/3410886.3410973,2020,10

College students are the main users of MOOCs, and the ability of autonomous learning is particularly important in the context of MOOCs. However, many college students still have problems in autonomous emotion, autonomous intelligence and autonomous behavior. Based on the advantages of rich MOOC resources and convenient operation, this article proposes strategies for college students to improve their learning autonomy. It includes the following three aspects. The first is to stimulate internal motivation and increase the consciousness of autonomy; the second is to use cognitive strategies to strengthen autonomous intelligence; the third is to use metacognitive strategies to monitor autonomous behavior.","Du, Wei","Learning Autonomy, College Students, MOOC",10.1145/3502434.3502481,2022,5
inproceedings,Monitoring Of Students' Soft Skills Development Within Foreign Language Learning Using Online Technologies,"Digital transformation in the world poses new challenges for workers: employers now demand employees possessing excellent professional, management, and communication skills. But modern higher education is not ready for developing such soft skills due to several problems occurred: (1) a lack of a unified typology of soft skills; (2) differences in understanding of importance of developing soft skills between students, higher education professionals, and employers; (3) unavailability and the lack of focus of higher education institutions on the development of students' soft skills; (4) the lack of valid methodologies for developing soft skills. The author used a method of content analysis of scientific literature and found out that there is relevance and necessity of improving students' soft skills and for managing this process in digital environment pedagogical monitoring can be used as it provides opportunities for well-timed control and solving occurring problems.Consequently, the aim of the research was to design a model for monitoring students' soft skills development using online technologies. The designed model includes usage of different types of monitoring and various learning and controlling teaching technologies. The experiment was carried out within foreign language learning as it can provide useful means of soft skills development. The study involved 226 first-year students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and was aimed at developing 3 categories of soft skills: communication, management, professional skills. Based on the content analysis, soft skills were developed using interactive teaching technologies; learning activities were uploaded into the Moodle, as well as testing was online. After utilizing the model proposed we figured out the statistical difference between results obtained during initial, intermediate, and final stages of the experiment, which proved the model's efficiency. Therefore, the model can be useful for soft skills development within foreign language learning in the system of higher education.","Medvedeva, Olesya","soft skills development, Soft skills, quality of higher education, interactive technologies, teaching technologies, foreign language learning, online technologies, pedagogical monitoring",10.1145/3446434.3446551,2021,10

This is why both psychology and subject-specific educational research deal with this topic. For computer science education, there have been no corresponding studies available so far. This paper reports on an empirical study in which around 500 German students from primary to higher education were presented with 23 IT-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) with a request to assign these to self-defined categories and to give the categories individual names. This paper gives a first insight into the categorization behavior.","Brinda, Torsten and Napierala, Stephan and Tobinski, David and Diethelm, Ira","digital literacy, higher education, digital artefacts, students' conceptions, K-12, categorization, computing education",10.1145/3265757.3265771,2018,4
inproceedings,Notes on Using Google Colaboratory in AI Education,"We discuss our experiences using Google Colaboratory (Colab), a hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks, in undergraduate artificial intelligence (AI) courses at two universities. Colab was designed for AI and data science researchers to share reproducible experiments and explanations of techniques, but we have also found it well suited to classroom use. The primary benefit is that it provides students computational resources sufficient to run modern AI techniques interactively, and avoids students needing to separately configure software packages and dependencies, since they can run notebooks shared by the instructor. We briefly outline two of our notebooks, for teaching deep learning with Tensorflow, and reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gym.","Nelson, Mark J. and Hoover, Amy K.","notebook interface, AI education, Google colab, Jupyter notebook",10.1145/3341525.3393997,2020,2
inproceedings,Contextual Intelligence for Unified Data Governance,"Current data governance techniques are very labor-intensive, as teams of data stewards typically rely on best practices to transform business policies into governance rules. As data plays an increasingly key role in today's data-driven enterprises, current approaches do not scale to the complexity and variety present in the data ecosystem of an enterprise as an increasing number of data requirements, use cases, applications, tools and systems come into play. We believe techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning have potential to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in data governance. In this paper, we propose a framework for 'contextual intelligence', where we argue for (1) collecting and integrating contextual metadata from variety of sources to establish a trusted unified repository of contextual data use across users and applications, and (2) applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques over this rich contextual metadata to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in governance practices. We propose an architecture that unifies governance across several systems, with a graph serving as a core repository of contextual metadata, accurately representing data usage across the enterprise and facilitating machine learning, We demonstrate how our approach can enable ML-based recommendations in support of governance best practices.","Seabolt, Ed and Kandogan, Eser and Roth, Mary","Context, Data Governance, Analytics, Graph",10.1145/3211954.3211955,2018,9
inproceedings,A Multiple Case Study of Artificial Intelligent System Development in Industry,"There is a rapidly increasing amount of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems developed in recent years, with much expectation on its capacity of innovation and business value generation. However, the promised value of AI systems in specific business contexts might not be understood, and further integrated into the development processes. We wanted to understand how software engineering processes and practices can be applied to develop AI systems in a fast-faced, business-driven manner. As the first step, we explored contextual factors of AI development and the connections between AI developments to business opportunities. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews in seven companies in Brazil, Norway and Southeast Asia. Our investigation revealed different types of AI systems and different AI development approaches. However, it is common that business opportunities involving with AI systems are not validated and there is lack of business-driven metrics that guide the development of AI systems. The findings have implications for future research on business-driven AI development and supporting tools and practices.","Nguyen-Duc, Anh and Sundb\o{}, Ingrid and Nascimento, Elizamary and Conte, Tayana and Ahmed, Iftekhar and Abrahamsson, Pekka","Software Development, SEMAT, Pivot, Business opportunity, Artificial Intelligent system, AI business pattern, Software Engineering",10.1145/3383219.3383220,2020,10
inproceedings,Towards Equity and Algorithmic Fairness in Student Grade Prediction,"Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing, achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student attributes and allow institutions to instrument their AI resources in ways that are attentive to equity and fairness.","Jiang, Weijie and Pardos, Zachary A.","grade prediction, fairness, equity, higher education",10.1145/3461702.3462623,2021,10
inproceedings,Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,"Increased enrolments in higher education, and the shift to online learning that has been escalated by the recent COVID pandemic, have made it challenging for instructors to assist their students with their learning needs. Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students.","Shabaninejad, Shiva and Khosravi, Hassan and Abdi, Solmaz and Indulska, Marta and Sadiq, Shazia","explainable learning analytics, at-risk students, learning analytics dashboards",10.1145/3491140.3528292,2022,5
inproceedings,Revealing Factors Influencing Students' Perceived Fairness: A Case with a Predictive System for Math Learning,"Educational researchers have examined artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support students' learning at a large scale. However, it has been broadly identified that AI models can suffer from algorithmic bias. A recent educational research initiative has shifted to evaluate and address algorithmic bias. Nonetheless, few studies have examined students' perceived fairness towards AI-enhanced systems in education. This study aimed to explore and understand factors that shape students' perceived fairness towards an AI system for math learning at the college level. Specifically, we have conducted a between-subjects randomized experiment with 395 participants to reveal factors that influenced participants' perceptions of fairness. The results showed that students' math anxiety levels and majors could influence participants' reported perceived fairness. In contrast, the outcome favorability of the predictive system did not affect students' perceptions of fairness. Future investigations have been planned to further understand the relationships between the designed manipulations and perceived fairness.","Li, Chenglu and Xing, Wanli","math learning, fair AI, perceived fairness, human-centered computing",10.1145/3491140.3528293,2022,4

inproceedings,Incorporating the Concepts of Fairness and Bias into an Undergraduate Computer Science Course to Promote Fair Automated Decision Systems,"Data bias and algorithmic bias are the primary contributing factors for fairness-related risks in AI-based decision-making. The concept of fairness is comparatively new and is sometimes only discussed in detail in graduate-level courses such as Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence. In addition, at the undergraduate level, a standalone course on fairness is not feasible due to the level of difficulty and the many other essential courses that need to be broached in a university's computer science curriculum. Therefore, instead of a standalone course, we have created a concise, high-level concept module on bias and fairness in automated decisions, with (1) lecture material, (2) demonstrations, and (3) assignments (i.e., exercises) on real-world datasets.","Islam, Sheikh Rabiul and Russell, Ingrid and Eberle, William and Dicheva, Darina","bias, artificial intelligence, automated decision-making, fairness",10.1145/3478432.3499043,2022,1

We propose a personalized recommendation system called ""Course Navigator"" for guiding undergraduate Information Technology (IT) students in selecting course curriculum based on their self-reported goal orientation and past course performance. We analyzed data from 2500 IT students at University of Central Florida (UCF) to create course recommendations. Our preliminary results show that the course recommendations for students with different goal orientations differ and may help students customize their course selections based on their goals.","Basavaraj, Prateek and Garibay, Ivan","recommendation systems, mathematics, engineering, science, personalized learning, technology, (stem) education",10.1145/3148330.3154508,2018,4
inproceedings,The Ethical Acceptability of Artificial Social Agents,"Artificial social agents (ASAs) are computer-based autonomous entities who interact with humans in a range of social roles, including advising, coaching, and consumer support in education and health. While there are many discussions around the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in general, such as the AI4People Ethical Framework, the ethical ramifications that ASAs will have on human relationships as we share not only personal data but our inner most thoughts and feelings, is less explored. We conducted a study with 199 student participants exposed to Sam, an ASA which acts as a personal guide to support the student during their studies. During the interaction, Sam elicits private information, takes decisions for the user and speaks of its own study experiences. Our results indicate that (loss of) autonomy raised the strongest ethical concerns. These results confirm the importance of informed consent, transparency and accountability of ASAs and question the ethics of false memories and emotion sharing.","Vythilingam, Ravi and Richards, Deborah and Formosa, Paul","artificial social agents, ai4people framework, ethical ai",,2022,3

With the increasing usage of application of artificial intelligence requirements for more complexity presentations of XCS have become more critical. And learning multiple problems is a subject that was needed but few one studied. To dynamically learn multiple problems during a single learning process, we applied a novel representation of classifier conditions of the XCS, named Sensory Tag (ST) to achieve this goal.

article,Investigation of the Effect of “Fog of War” in the Prediction of StarCraft Strategy Using Machine Learning,"StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is “fog of war,” which refers to the fact that players cannot see their opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the game means that the information required in order to predicting the opponent's strategy is only available through “scouting.” Although the “fog of war” is one of the most important features of the game, it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the “fog of war” in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs. human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic analysis with “fog of war” reveals the predictability of the machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.","Cho, Hochul and Park, Hyunsoo and Kim, Chang-Yeun and Kim, Kyung-Joong","strategy prediction, machine learning, starcraft, Real-time strategy game, fog of war, AI bots",10.1145/2735384,2016,16

Nevertheless, the human- computer's multimodal interaction is actually a dynamic and evolutionary process, so there are still some difficult issues that need to be further explored such as how to comprehensively deal with the multimodal fusion data, adaptively consider the user's personalized habits, and precisely understand the expresser's intentions. NeuroManagement, an emerging interdisciplinary subject to study human's management based on neural mechanism, provides new theory and methodology for probing into the above issues. From the perspective of NeuroManagement, this keynote paper analyzes the user's neural mechanism of multimodal interactions, discusses the characteristics of neural activities in that process, and proposes a framework of intelligent computation method to understand and measure the user's intentions as well as his/her psychological states.

inproceedings,The Landscape of Teaching Resources for AI Education,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) educational resources such as training tools, interactive demos, and dedicated curriculum are increasingly popular among educators and learners. While prior work has examined pedagogies for promoting AI literacy, it has yet to examine how well technology resources support these pedagogies. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic analysis of existing online resources for AI education, investigating what learning and teaching affordances these resources have to support AI education. We used the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework to analyze a final corpus of 50 AI resources. We found that most resources support active learning, have digital or physical dependencies, do not include all the five big ideas defined by AI4K12 guidelines, and do not offer built-in support for assessment or feedback. Teaching guides are hard to find or require technical knowledge. Based on our findings, we propose that future AI curricula move from singular activities and demos to more holistic designs that include support, guidance, and flexibility for how AI technology, concepts, and pedagogy play out in the classroom.","Druga, Stefania and Otero, Nancy and Ko, Amy J.","ai education, teaching support, k12",10.1145/3502718.3524782,2022,7

inproceedings,The Tool for Migrating Learning Content from Moodle to Open EdX,"Massive open online courses are a promising area of interest of higher education institutions in their competition for students. However, typically specialised open platforms are used to create such courses, while courses in higher education institutions are delivered through learning management systems. Thus, a higher education institution meets a severe challenge if it decides to offer its study courses as massive open online courses: the content hosted in the learning management system need to be transferred to another platform or re-created. The automated tools developed for this purpose could (at least partially) speed up the learning content migration process while also reducing the amount of manual work required. The paper presents the research results achieved regarding the migration of the content of Moodle courses into Open edX through the use of the cloud-based automated migration tool.

inproceedings,Automate the Peripheral Arterial Disease Prediction in Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler Study Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks,"This research work aims to automate the prediction of peripheral arterial diseases implied by the Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler (LEAD) studies by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This study is the first to use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze LEAD data for peripheral arterial disease prediction. Specifically, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the waveform into three types. The classified waveforms are used as input to the learning algorithms for disease prediction. We evaluate two traditional machine learning algorithms as well as two neural networks to predict normal and three types of artery diseases: aortoiliac disease, femoral-popliteal arterial disease, and trifurcation disease. The hierarchical neural network model (HNN) is investigated to deal with imbalanced data set. The first level of the HNN predicts the normal from diseases. The remaining two neural networks are used to predict other diseases from the rest. HNN has achieved high F1 scores: 99% on the normal case, 97% on the aortoiliac disease, and 94% on the femoral-popliteal arterial disease and 89% on the trifurcation disease through 10-fold cross-validation. The comparison shows that HNN works better than multilayer perceptron, random forests, and SVM. The overall result demonstrates that machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can be developed for peripheral arterial diseases implied by the LEAD studies while reducing the reading variability in vascular laboratories.","Ara, Lena and Luo, Xiao and Sawchuk, Alan and Rollins, Dave","neural networks, lower extremity arterial doppler, peripheral arterial disease prediction",10.1145/3307339.3342180,2019,6

This paper investigates the application of a VUI system aimed at providing student support and derives insights on user experience. As part of this study, a VUI prototype was designed and implemented to help Computer Science students in their studies by providing academic guides notably on academic writing, referencing, and programming. Evaluation involved the application of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to assess three constructs notably, response behavior, response quality and compensability.","Seeroo, Ouwesh and Bekaroo, Girish","User Experience, Chatbot, Voice Interaction, Student Support, Voice User Interface",10.1145/3487923.3487936,2021,6
inproceedings,Designing a Collaborative Game-Based Learning Environment for AI-Infused Inquiry Learning in Elementary School Classrooms,"Recent years have seen growing recognition of the importance of enabling K-12 students to learn computer science. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence has emerged as a technology with the potential to profoundly reshape society. This has generated increasing demand for fostering an AI-literate populace. However, there is little work exploring how to introduce K-12 students to AI and how to support K-12 teachers in integrating AI into their classrooms. In this work, we explore introducing AI learning experiences into upper elementary classrooms (student ages 8 to 11). With a focus on integrating AI and life science, we present initial work on a collaborative game-based learning environment that features rich problem-based learning scenarios. This will enable students to gain experience with AI as it applies to solving real-world life-science problems.","Lee, Seung and Mott, Bradford and Ottenbriet-Leftwich, Anne and Scribner, Adam and Taylor, Sandra and Glazewski, Krista and Hmelo-Silver, Cindy E. and Lester, James","K-12 education, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3341525.3393981,2020,1
inproceedings,High Performance Computing Education: Current Challenges and Future Directions,"High Performance Computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at extremely high speeds. Current HPC platforms can achieve calculations on the order of quadrillions of calculations per second, with quintillions on the horizon. The past three decades witnessed a vast increase in the use of HPC across different scientific, engineering, and business communities on problems such as sequencing the genome, predicting climate changes, designing modern aerodynamics, or establishing customer preferences. Although HPC has been well incorporated into science curricula such as bioinformatics, the same cannot be said for most computing programs. Computing educators are only now beginning to recognize the need for HPC Education (HPCEd). Building on earlier work, this working group explored how HPCEd can make inroads into computing education, focusing on the undergraduate level. This paper presents the background of HPC and HPCEd, identifies several of the needed core HPC competencies for students, identifies the support needed by educators for HPCEd, and explores the symbiosis between HPCEd and computing education in contemporary areas such as artificial intelligence and data science, as well as how HPCEd can be applied to benefit diverse non-computing domains such as atmospheric science, biological sciences and critical infrastructure protection.

inproceedings,Students' Performance Tracking in Distributed Open Education Using Big Data Analytics,"The field of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is advancing rapidly, and it is finding adoption in diverse areas such as Health, Commerce, Logistics, Retail and Manufacturing to name a few. Adoption of BDA techniques in the field of Higher Education is new, and it is steadily increasing. In this work, BDA techniques have been applied to track the Key Academic Performance Indicators (KAPIs) related to students at the Arab Open University (AOU) and to support the corresponding decisions in this regard. Since the AOU is a Pan Arab multi-campus distributed institution operating in 8 countries and makes extensive use of a wide range of cloud based applications to manage the students' life cycle, hence it is an ideal candidate for adoption of BDA techniques to track students' KAPIs across the AOU multiple country campuses. In order to achieve this objective, we have used IBM Watson Analytics (WA) platform to track the students' KAPIs. As a pilot project, we have focused in this work on the Information Technology and Computing (ITC) academic programme across the AOU. The Exploration and Business Intelligence BDA capabilities of WA have enabled us to analyze and track the academic KAPIs of the ITC students across AOU country campuses while the Predictive Analytics (PA) has led to identifying the dominant factors behind some of our problems such as students drop out rates. One of the most promising outcomes is the decision support dashboards such as the one related to the Student Risk Factor (SRF). By identifying At Risk Students, such dashboard can act as an ""Early Alert System"" to enable the AOU management to take corrective action to provide needed support to such students.","Hussein, Ashraf S. and Khan, Hamayun A.","academic key performance indicators, big data analytics, educational data analytics, student information systems, watson analytics",10.1145/3018896.3018975,2017,8

inproceedings,Features of Calculating Cost of Services in Educational Institutions Based on the ABC Method,"Heads of higher educational institutions seek to optimize costs and increase the effectiveness of the educational institution. In this regard, they need to know how resources are allocated and used by type of activity. Due to its simplicity, direct costing methods are used. Overhead is distributed in proportion to the number of students. Traditional methods of costing the cost of providing services do not allow taking into account all the features of the activities of educational institutions and the business processes that occur in them, which determines the relevance of the research topic. It is necessary to apply methods that allow you to compare management accounting data with the types of activities and determine at what stage the provision of educational services requires improvement. This method is Activity-based costing. The volumes of consumed resources are calculated depending on the types of activities. The purpose of the study is to justify the use of the Activity-based Costing (hereinafter - ABC) parameter when using the cost of training programs for students in higher education. The theoretical and methodological base of the research lies in the works of leading Russian and foreign scientists concerning the substantiation of methods for calculating the cost of products (works, services), accounting regulations. The research methodology is based on the systems approach used to study various calculation systems with general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, comparison, synthesis, grouping and classification. The use of a modern method of cost accounting and production costing ABC will allow higher education institution to form the cost of training students for each course more objectively, which will objectively form the price for paid services and generate more reliable performance indicators of individual departments and chairs. The results of the study can be used in state and commercial institutions of higher education in determining the cost of services for training students in various programs. The scientific novelty of the study consists in developing a model of the distribution of indirect costs by function using the ABC method to determine the cost of training programs for students in higher education institutions.","Demina, Irina and Bergal, Elena and Bezrukov, Dmitriy","method of distribution of indirect costs, ABC method, cost drivers, higher education, business processes, calculation of the cost of educational services, higher education institution",10.1145/3372177.3372178,2020,7

Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.","Flathmann, Christopher and Schelble, Beau and Tubre, Brock and McNeese, Nathan and Rodeghero, Paige","human-agent teamwork, artificial intelligence, human-ai, human-agent interaction, groupware",10.1145/3406499.3415072,2020,10

inproceedings,The Functional Architecture Design and Value Orientation of the Intelligent Tutoring System from the Perspective of Man-Machine Collaboration,"In the era of ""artificial intelligence + education"", personalized education based on man-machine collaboration has emerged. Based on the differences of learners and the implementation of personalized teaching, the functional architecture design of the ""man-machine collaboration precision tutoring system"" is proposed. The system architecture is divided into three layers: data resource layer, decision processing layer and interactive promotion layer. The data resource layer provides data recording and resource support, the decision processing layer plays the role of data diagnosis and learning analysis, and the interaction promotion layer realizes flexible interaction and grouping. Through collaboration and hierarchical interaction with teachers, a more idealized system can be constructed, which can integrate evidence analysis, timely feedback and personalized support. The value orientation of the system architecture is: teachers and students and intelligent systems expand time and space in collaborative activities, teachers and intelligent systems improve teaching in collaborative optimization, and students and intelligent systems enhance themselves in collaborative interaction.","Zhao, Xi and Chen, Mei","Man-machine collaboration, Precise tutoring, Learning Analytics, Personalized system",10.1145/3510309.3510320,2022,6
inproceedings,Adaptive Learning Based on AI with Predictive Algorithms,"Learning Analytics (LA) is an analysis toolset that enables collection of students' data and context data, for the purpose of visualizing indicators of performance that allow for improvements for learning and academic success. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest were used. These algorithms trained a model that could predict the academic success of college-level engineering students. Under an experimental model with 182 students, three instructors leading six groups of Physics II for engineering majors of the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) administered adaptive measures for one group each and not for the other of their groups (the control groups). Three forecasts were calculated considering structured academic information (numerical grades) and unstructured academic information (student ID pictures). Unstructured data from the facial photograph and numeric academic information from the first evaluation period were considered for the study. The results show a significant difference between the control and experimental groups of only one instructor, while the results of the other two instructors' control and experimental groups were consistent. One finding of this study is that, despite the prediction not being correct for each student, a general picture of the performance of the group was given. It seems that the algorithm must be trained with more data for the forecast to be more precise in the future.","Rinc\'{o}n-Flores, Elvira G. and Mena, Juanjo and L\'{o}pez-Camacho, Eunice and Olmos, Omar","adaptive learning, learning analytics, decision trees, Artificial intelligence, predictive algorithms, Educational Innovation",10.1145/3362789.3362869,2019,6
inproceedings,Developing Industry-Relevant Higher Order Thinking Skills in Computing Students,"A 2016 survey commissioned by the British Higher Education Council revealed CS graduates had one of the highest unemployment rates. Industry sources attribute this to a growing gap between employer expectations and university curriculum. This gap primarily consists of soft skills and higher-order thinking skills, which include the ability to analyse, synthesise, evaluate, critique and design. Technical job advertisements increasingly specify higher order thinking skills as entry requirements for graduates.This paper presents the results of our work studying whether formative tasks can develop higher-order thinking skills. The formative tasks consisted of quizzes covering the first four levels of the Bloom's taxonomy. The higher-order thinking skills were measured based on the static and dynamic models students created for a real world problem, as part of the final exam. Our results reveal a strong correlation exists between application and analysis level quizzes and design activities needing higher-order thinking in the exam. Students repeating the quizzes several times also had better results than others in higher-order design skills. These results suggest that practising with well-constructed quizzes especially at the higher Bloom's level exercises the cognitive channels that help improve higher-order thinking skills.","Kalra, Shekhar and Thevathayan, Charles and Hamilton, Margaret","higher order thinking skills, computer science education, intelligent tutoring systems, employability",10.1145/3341525.3387381,2020,6
inproceedings,The Intervention of Internet Technology on Students' English Learning in the Intelligent Era,"Objective: With the development of the Internet, Internet technology has had a great impact on English learning. This article explores the general expression of the performance, motivation and anxiety of students in Chinese medicine undergraduates in second language learning (SLL). performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates in China, it is to analyze the attribution and relationship of above three aspects, and propose the method of using artificial intelligence to improve students’ learning motivation, reduce learning anxiety and improve learning ability. Methods: it is to select the undergraduate students (n = 300) in Jilin Province of China as the subjects. Use the Chinese version of the Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale under Internet technology, the Chinese Undergraduate English Learning Motivation Questionnaire, the self-made College Students’ English learning ability evaluation scale and the English Writing Scale were used for test. Results: SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates are in the middle level among all undergraduates in China, and their English writing ability is lower than the middle level; Analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences in gender (p&lt;0.01) and grade (p&lt;0.05); learning ability in grade has extremely significant difference (p&lt;0.01); female 's learning ability and writing ability were significantly higher than male's (p&lt;0.01);Demographic variables were not statistically correlated with SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety (p&gt;0.05); SLL anxiety had remarkable correlation with learning motivation (p&gt;0.05); learning anxiety was statistically correlated with learning ability (p&lt;0.01); learning motivation was negative correlative with learning ability (P&lt;0.01). Regression analysis showed that learning anxiety and motivation had 44.3% and 5.8% explanatory power to English learning ability respectively. Intervention experiment results showed that Internet learning system significantly improved the performance of the experimental group (P&lt;0.01), and the performance of the experimental group in listening, reading, writing and translation was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&lt;0.01). the effectiveness of Internet learning mode had remarkable negative relationship with students’ learning anxiety (P&lt;0.01), and was significantly positive with learning motivation and learning ability (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the data-driven theory, the empirical study of Internet learning system in English teaching is completed, which provides an important theoretical support for the current College English intelligent teaching in China, which also provides a strong argument for the “scaffolding function” of AI in language learning. At the same time, the research also puts forward innovative ways to improve the effect of College English teaching from the perspective of psychology: through second language learning with AI resources, the “challenging task” set by the intelligent learning system increases the intensity and difficulty of learning, thus arousing the “promoting anxiety” of second language learners, and further internalizing the external and instrumental motivation in depth in order to improve English learning ability.","Su, Zheqian and Liu, Miao and Song, Bailin and Lian, Shulin",,10.1145/3482632.3483015,2021,6

inproceedings,Auto-Generated Ensemble Model for Predicting Student Success,"Students' success has recently become a primary strategic objective for most intuitions of higher education. With budget cuts and ramping operational costs, universities are paying more attention to sustaining students' enrollment in their programs without compromising rigor and quality of education. Many of those universities have dedicated special units in their organizational structures to look after that objective. Traditionally, academic institutions have relied on data collected from registrar's transcripts, academic units' feedback, faculty's alert, and from interaction with students.With the proliferation of big data analytics and Machine Learning, universities are increasingly relying on students' data to predict students' performance. Many initiatives and research projects addressed the use of students' behavioral and academic data in their first academic year to classify students and predict their future performance using advanced statistical models. However, little work has been done to predict academic performance through machine learning. In this paper, we propose the use of automatic search in Machine Learning to identify the best model to predict student performance using data available prior to the start of the academic program.","Zeineddine, Hassan and Braendle, Udo and Farah, Assaad","higher education, prediction accuracy of student performance, pre-admission data, machine learning",10.1145/3368691.3368714,2019,4

However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source.In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.","Raji, Inioluwa Deborah and Smart, Andrew and White, Rebecca N. and Mitchell, Margaret and Gebru, Timnit and Hutchinson, Ben and Smith-Loud, Jamila and Theron, Daniel and Barnes, Parker","accountability, algorithmic audits, responsible innovation, machine learning",10.1145/3351095.3372873,2020,12

article,Instilling Conscience about Bias and Fairness in Automated Decisions,"Automated decision-making that impacts human interests, rights, and lives, in particular different data mining and artificial intelligence-based techniques, have become an integral part of many high-stakes applications such as sentencing and bail decisions, credit approvals, hiring, and predictive policing. However, fairness concerns, such as discrimination based on race, age, sex, etc., primarily stemming from data and algorithmic bias, is one of the major and contemporary problems associated with automated decision-making. In a traditional Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning course, educators usually teach different automated decision-making techniques but largely with limited coverage on their ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and privacy. In this paper, we share our experience in building and incorporating a fairness module 1 in an existing undergraduate Data Mining course, within traditional content, and evaluate the outcome of the initiative. The module includes lectures and hands-on exercises, using state-of-the-art and open-source bias detection and mitigation software, on real-world datasets. The goal is to help instill the consciousness of fairness and bias at the very early stage of a potential future developer of automated decision-making software. The module is easily adaptable, and can be integrated into other relevant courses including introductory Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning courses.","Islam, Sheikh Rabiul and Russell, Ingrid and Eberle, William and Dicheva, Darina",,,2022,10

inproceedings,Study on Prediction of Legal Judgments Based on the CNN-BiGRU Model,"As the cases exploded, leading legal judgment prediction becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques in the legal field. The goal of legal judgment prediction is to predict the judgment results based on the facts information of a case. However, the classifier of the traditional method has poor accuracy performance and cost large computational time. The commonly used deep learning models are CNN and RNN. In this paper, CNN-BiGRU was established and analyzed, which combined the good extraction ability of CNN for local feature information and RNN for long-term dependencies information of the text. Compared with the CAIL 2018 dataset, the prediction accuracy of the charges, law articles and the terms of penalty are 94.8%, 93.6%, and 73.4%, respectively. Results showed that CNN-BiGRU has a higher prediction accuracy than CNN or RNN alone and a good training efficiency over baselines.

inproceedings,An Instrument for Measuring Teachers’ Trust in AI-Based Educational Technology,"Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners’ AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers’ attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers’ input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers’ trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech’s Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech’s Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers’ responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers’ survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers’ trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education.","Nazaretsky, Tanya and Cukurova, Mutlu and Alexandron, Giora","Teachers, K-12 Education, Human Factors, Blended Learning, AI, Trust",10.1145/3506860.3506866,2022,11

article,Introduction to The Special Section on Bias and Fairness in AI,"Fairness in Artificial Intelligence rightfully receives a lot of attention these days. Many life-impacting decisions are being partially automated, including health-care resource planning decisions, insurance and credit risk predictions, recidivism predictions, etc. Much of work appearing on this topic within the Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence community is focused on technological aspects. Nevertheless, fairness is much wider than this as it lies at the intersection of philosophy, ethics, legislation, and practical perspectives. Therefore, to fill this gap and bring together scholars of these disciplines working on fairness, the first workshop on Bias and Fairness in AI was held online on September 18, 2020 at the ECML-PKDD 2020 conference.

When these systems begin to interact with humans, these concerns become much more complex and much more important. The field of human-AI teaming provides a relevant example of how AI ethics can have significant and continued effects on humans. This paper reviews research in ethical artificial intelligence, as well as ethical teamwork through the lens of the rapidly advancing field of human-AI teaming, resulting in a model demonstrating the requirements and outcomes of building ethical human-AI teams. The model is created to guide the prioritization of ethics in human-AI teaming by outlining the ethical teaming process, outcomes of ethical teams, and external requirements necessary to ensure ethical human-AI teams. A final discussion is presented on how the developed model will influence the implementation of AI teammates, as well as the development of policy and regulation surrounding the domain in the coming years.","Flathmann, Christopher and Schelble, Beau G. and Zhang, Rui and McNeese, Nathan J.","human-AI teamwork, human-AI ethics, artificial intelligence, AI ethics",10.1145/3461702.3462573,2021,11
inproceedings,A Preliminary Study Using Academagogy to Uncover the Problems That Block Adult Online Learner Engagement,"Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the online learning experience.","Addanki, Kranthi and Holdsworth, Jason and Hardy, Dianna and Myers, Trina","Online learning, academagogy, Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) continuum, design-based research, adult learners, personalisation",10.1145/3511861.3511872,2022,10

inproceedings,"More Than ""If Time Allows"": The Role of Ethics in AI Education","Even as public pressure mounts for technology companies to consider societal impacts of products, industries and governments in the AI race are demanding technical talent. To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions.

inproceedings,Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System,"As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.","McIlroy-Young, Reid and Sen, Siddhartha and Kleinberg, Jon and Anderson, Ashton","human-ai collaboration, chess, action prediction",10.1145/3394486.3403219,2020,11

inproceedings,Learning Fair Representations for Recommendation: A Graph-Based Perspective,"As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user’s and each item’s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation.

inproceedings,A Model of Consumer Perception and Behavioral Intention for AI Service,"The success of AlphaGo makes artificial intelligence once again widely reported and concerned. At present, artificial intelligence has gone from speech recognition to natural language processing to smart voice assistants, from graphic recognition to machine vision to smart supermarkets. The application of artificial intelligence has made significant progress in many fields, and smart speakers with natural language processing as the core technology are currently attracting attention. AI application services based on natural language technology include mobile phone voice assistants, smart speakers, and humanoid robots. Although these different types of AI application services are given the important task of human-machine communication and service interface in the future AI society, the common point is that these smart speakers have the service function of dissemination. The application of AI is an important issue for the development of various types of industries in the next few years.

article,Doctor's Dilemma: Evaluating an Explainable Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Brain Tumor Diagnosis,"In Medicine Deep Learning has become an essential tool to achieve outstanding diagnosis on image data. However, one critical problem is that Deep Learning comes with complicated, black-box models so it is not possible to analyze their trust level directly. So, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to build additional interfaces for explaining how the model has reached the outputs by moving from the input data. Of course, that's again another competitive problem to analyze if such methods are successful according to the human view. So, this paper comes with two important research efforts: (1) to build an explainable deep learning model targeting medical image analysis, and (2) to evaluate the trust level of this model via several evaluation works including human contribution. The target problem was selected as the brain tumor classification, which is a remarkable, competitive medical image-based problem for Deep Learning. In the study, MR-based pre-processed brain images were received by the Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (SSLW-CNN) model, which includes additional operators to reduce the complexity of classification. In order to ensure the explainable background, the model also included Class Activation Mapping (CAM). It is important to evaluate the trust level of a successful model. So, numerical success rates of the SSLW-CNN were evaluated based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), computational time, computational overhead, and brain tumor classification accuracy. The objective of the proposed SSLW-CNN model is to obtain faster and good tumor classification with lesser time. The results illustrate that the SSLW-CNN model provides better performance of PSNR which is enhanced by 8%, classification accuracy is improved by 33%, computation time is reduced by 19%, computation overhead is decreased by 23%, and classification time is minimized by 13%, as compared to state-of-the-art works. Because the model provided good numerical results, it was then evaluated in terms of XAI perspective by including doctor-model based evaluations such as feedback CAM visualizations, usability, expert surveys, comparisons of CAM with other XAI methods, and manual diagnosis comparison. The results show that the SSLW-CNN provides good performance on brain tumor diagnosis and ensures a trustworthy solution for the doctors.","Kumar, Ambeshwar and Manikandan, Ramachandran and Kose, Utku and Gupta, Deepak and Satapathy, Suresh C.","brain tumor diagnosis, deep learning, subtractive spatial lightweight convolutional neural networks, medical imaging, Explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3457187,2021,26

inproceedings,Blockchain Technology in Student Physical Data Monitoring,"Improving the physical condition of students has become an urgent problem to be solved by national higher education. This research mainly discusses the application of blockchain technology in the monitoring of student physical data. Through simple exercise tests, block chain technology is used to obtain objective data such as user's cardiorespiratory endurance and muscle strength. These parameters will serve as the basis for personalized exercise guidance programs. This step replaces the common exhaustive test in traditional systems, and reliable results can still be obtained while ensuring a certain test accuracy. The generated fitness guidance plan is automatically downloaded on the intelligent fitness equipment and guides users to execute it, ensuring that the exercise plan is executed on time and accurately, and the experiential fitness guidance is completed. In the management cycle, the exercise intervention plan is adjusted periodically, and the effect of the intervention is maximized by continuously optimizing individual parameters. Among the physical monitoring students, 41.3% of female college students and 23.7% of male college students participated in physical exercise occasionally.

inproceedings,A Smart Chatbot Architecture Based NLP and Machine Learning for Health Care Assistance,"A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.","Ayanouz, Soufyane and Abdelhakim, Boudhir Anouar and Benhmed, Mohammed","conversational agents, Chatbots, artificial intelligence, natural language, modeling of conversations, neural machine translation",10.1145/3386723.3387897,2020,6

inproceedings,Using Business Intelligence to Support Strategic Sustainability Information Management,"The concept of sustainability has become an important phenomenon globally with many organisations being affected by the heightened awareness in sustainability. Organisations are more aware of the importance of promoting sustainability in all areas of operations. This is no different in the higher education sector, with a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) playing a leading role in promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability.This paper highlights the importance of effectively managing sustainability information and the challenges HEIs face in sustainability reporting. Business Intelligence (BI) is a solution to overcome the challenges and effectively managing sustainability information. However, HEIs need to overcome a number of challenges associated with BI to ensure a BI solution is correctly implemented and is effective in solving the problem of effective sustainability information management.

article,Study on Machine Translation Teaching Model Based on Translation Parallel Corpus and Exploitation for Multimedia Asian Information Processing,"Text in one language can be mechanically translated into another language using machine translation (MT). It is possible to anticipate a sequence of words, generally modeling full sentences using machine translation in a single integrated model. Human language's flexibility makes automatic translation an artificial intelligence (AI) challenge of the highest order. A single model rather than a pipeline of fine-tuned models is now the best way to attain state-of-the-art outcomes in machine translation. For example, words having numerous meanings, phrases that use more than one grammatical structure, and other grammar issues make it difficult for a machine to translate; however, many misinterpretations translate to be a breeze. A teacher's job is to assist pupils in overcoming the emotional and cognitive obstacles that stand in the way of developing effective problem-solving abilities. Students will benefit from developing problem-solving abilities since they will apply what they have learned to new circumstances. MT-AI, machine translation technology, and products have been employed in a wide range of applications, including business travel, tourism, and cross-lingual information retrieval. Text translation and phonetic translation are two types of translations that focus on the content of the source language. It is possible to create self-learning systems by injecting machine learning techniques into existing software and then observing the results of such injection. Computer software can translate a massive volume of text in a short period. It takes longer for a human translator to perform the same work as a computer program. The simulation investigation is developed based on correctness and effectiveness, demonstrating the proposed framework's reliability of 95.1%.","Gong, Yan","Human Translation, Artificial Intelligence, Student, Machine Translation",10.1145/3523282,2022,1

inproceedings,Artificial Moral Advisors: A New Perspective from Moral Psychology,"Philosophers have recently put forward the possibility of achieving moral enhancement through artificial intelligence (e.g., Giubilini and Savulescu's version [32]), proposing various forms of ""artificial moral advisor"" (AMA) to help people make moral decisions without the drawbacks of human cognitive limitations. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the AMA, drawing on empirical evidence from moral psychology to point out several challenges to these proposals that have been largely neglected by AI ethicists. In particular, we suggest that the AMA at its current conception is fundamentally misaligned with human moral psychology - it incorrectly assumes a static moral values framework underpinning the AMA's attunement to individual users, and people's reactions and subsequent (in)actions in response to the AMA suggestions will likely diverge substantially from expectations. As such, we note the necessity for a coherent understanding of human moral psychology in the future development of AMAs.","Liu, Yuxin and Moore, Adam and Webb, Jamie and Vallor, Shannon","ai moral enhancement, artificial moral advisor, moral psychology, normative ethics, ai ethics",10.1145/3514094.3534139,2022,10

inproceedings,The Incentive Mechanism of College Counselors Based on Intelligent Computing,"With the development of computer technology in our country, the vigorous development of higher education and the continuous deepening of higher education system reforms, intelligent computing has been integrated into the management system of universities, and significant changes have taken place in the content and functions of university management, and new changes have been proposed. As the backbone of students' ideological and political education, the team of college counselors is an important factor to ensure the continuous, healthy and rapid development of my country's higher education. The overall level and work status of the college counselor team will directly affect the effectiveness of ideological and political education and the realization of talent training goals. This article is based on the research of the university counselor incentive system based on intelligent computing. This article first uses the literature research method to analyze some problems in the incentive system of college counselors, and then proposes the necessity of reforming the incentive system for college counselors. Finally, it uses questionnaire surveys and quantitative analysis methods to analyze the work status of college counselors and how to deal with them. Research shows that the working conditions of college counselors are not very good. About 40% of counselors feel listless in their work, which may be related to the heavy workload. College counselors are dissatisfied with the incentive system, about 45% of them. It is possible that the incentive system of colleges and universities makes counselors not have great incentives for their salary and development.","Kong, Yanbo and Hu, Jianquan",,10.1145/3482632.3483068,2021,5
article,Recurrent Neural Networks for Edge Intelligence: A Survey,"Recurrent Neural Networks are ubiquitous and pervasive in many artificial intelligence applications such as speech recognition, predictive healthcare, creative art, and so on. Although they provide accurate superior solutions, they pose a massive challenge “training havoc.” Current expansion of IoT demands intelligent models to be deployed at the edge. This is precisely to handle increasing model sizes and complex network architectures. Design efforts to meet these for greater performance have had inverse effects on portability on edge devices with real-time constraints of memory, latency, and energy. This article provides a detailed insight into various compression techniques widely disseminated in the deep learning regime. They have become key in mapping powerful RNNs onto resource-constrained devices. While compression of RNNs is the main focus of the survey, it also highlights challenges encountered while training. The training procedure directly influences model performance and compression alongside. Recent advancements to overcome the training challenges with their strengths and drawbacks are discussed. In short, the survey covers the three-step process, namely, architecture selection, efficient training process, and suitable compression technique applicable to a resource-constrained environment. It is thus one of the comprehensive survey guides a developer can adapt for a time-series problem context and an RNN solution for the edge.","Lalapura, Varsha S. and Amudha, J. and Satheesh, Hariramn Selvamuruga","resource constrained modeling, low-rank, edge intelligence (EI), training, compression, artificial intelligence (AI), Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sparsity, sequence modeling",10.1145/3448974,2021,38

inproceedings,"Modular Experiential Learning for Secure, Safe, and Reliable AI: Curricular Initiative to Promote Education in Trustworthy AI","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to IT systems. However, AI can be manipulated to perform undesirably, exhibit biases or abusive behaviors. When AI algorithms are parallelized on high-performance computing-based cyberinfrastructure (CI), such misbehaviors and uncertainty can multiply to obscure the root causes. Secure, safe, and reliable computing techniques can mitigate these problems. The project described in this paper aims to inform curriculum and develop materials to educate students who use AI from the outset, so that they will first become aware of the issues and secondly practical considerations will be integrated with theory in classes. Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to rapidly upgrade the skills of current and future CI users, so they can apply new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be taken as standalone self-directed units or integrated into existing classes, starting with CS 1 and CS 2, which are taken by many non-CS STEM students. In a sandpit environment, learners take measured risks when guided on a journey of discovery. The primary purpose of this paper is to present key findings of the research following a 2-year pilot. A secondary purpose of the paper is to disseminate this exciting endeavor broadly, so that likeminded educators and researchers can consider participating in the project.","Fong, Alvis and Gupta, Ajay and Carr, Steve and Bhattacharjee, Shameek and Harnar, Michael","Curricular initiative, artificial intelligence trustworthiness, experiential learning, IT education",10.1145/3537674.3554756,2022,7

We conducted an interview study with 12 blind and low vision, and 7 deaf and hard of hearing current and former doctoral students in computing to understand how graduate students adjust to inaccessibility and ineffective accommodations. We asked participants how they worked around inaccessibility, managed ineffective accommodations, and advocated for tools and services. Employing a lens of ableism in our analysis, we found that participants’ extra effort to address accessibility gaps gave rise to a burden of survival, which they sustained to meet expectations of graduate-level productivity. We recommend equitable solutions that acknowledge taken-for-granted workarounds and that actively address inaccessibility in the graduate school context.","Shinohara, Kristen and McQuaid, Mick and Jacobo, Nayeri","Higher Education, Computing Education Research, Ableism, Accessibility",10.1145/3411764.3445277,2021,13

The stability and accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been improved, making voice more critical in the transaction process and voice consultation of e-commerce purchases. ASR matches the learning model based on contextual cues. Eliminating unnecessary text plays an important role. We use the LSTM model and change it to contextualized custom text. In addition, to use our robot for testing, we propose a multi-task model that can jointly perform content re-scoring and has excellent responsiveness in the text of the input entity. Therefore, this article recommends using ASR technology to interpret and predict the answers to the LSTM model, allowing users to obtain expected results from actual measurements and understand which aspects are suitable for predicting specific emotions tested on this group.

inproceedings,A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Early Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Using MRI,"The continuous evolution of technology in Biomedicine has given satisfactory answers for several complex diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the major neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, belongs to this category. So far, no cure reverses or stops the biological changes that occur in the brains of patients; however, the early diagnosis and early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease is a crucial step in reducing the burden on both the patient and the caregivers. One of the predominant ways to deal with this difficulty is by integrating artificial intelligence and large-scale biomedical data. In this direction, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution data, which can be decrypted through artificial intelligence tools. In recent years, the research community has shifted to deep learning methods applied to medical images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In the present work, we propose a hybrid (called CNN-SVM) model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to predict the early AD stages from MRI.

inproceedings,A Classification of How MOOCs Are Used for Blended Learning,"There are many different examples of where MOOCs have been integrated into teaching and learning in a higher education context. These approaches are typically called blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) and are not intended to replace traditional learning methods but rather to enhance them. Despite increasing interest in bMOOCs there have been few attempts to date to describe with breadth the different ways in which they have been integrated with formal teaching and learning, this means that there are few guides for practitioners, and that it is difficult for the research community to compare different examples. This paper proposes a hierarchy classification of how blended MOOCs are used by presenting a systematic literature review leading to an analysis of 20 different case studies, which is then validated by an independent expert review. The resulting classification model differentiates between Supplementary and Integrated bMOOCs, where Integrated can itself be broken down into models that focus on Content, Assessment, or Interaction. Our work shows that there are at least eight different models for using bMOOCs within formal teaching and learning, although most of the existing research focuses on the Flipped Classroom model (a sub-type of the Content model). Our work therefore reveals gaps in the current understanding of bMOOCs, and will also help to contextualize and scope future research and analysis.","Alghamdi, Taghreed and Hall, Wendy and Millard, David","Blended Learning, Blended MOOCs models, Higher Education, MOOCs",10.1145/3345094.3345107,2019,7

In artificial intelligence, the 2D image recognition of deep learning is relatively mature, but the 3D point cloud image is still in development. Because the data of 3D point cloud is larger than that of 2D image, and the scanning method is different, which affects the point cloud image to generate different data types. For various reasons, the development of 3D point clouds still requires us to make more efforts to study how to improve them. With the continuous expansion of the data size, the computing performance becomes more important, and in deep learning, the convolutional layer occupies a very important position. If the performance can be improved in the convolutional layer, it will definitely bring good benefits to artificial intelligence, so this paper will propose the use of efficient reuse, depthwise separable convolution, quantization, and Winograd algorithm to accelerate the operation and reduce the weight.

inproceedings,Game&nbsp;State Learning via Game&nbsp;Scene&nbsp;Augmentation,"Having access to accurate game state information is of utmost importance for any artificial intelligence task including game-playing, testing, player modeling, and procedural content generation. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have shown to be capable of inferring accurate game state information from the high-dimensional pixel input of game footage into compressed latent representations. Contrastive Learning is a popular SSL paradigm where the visual understanding of the game’s images comes from contrasting dissimilar and similar game states defined by simple image augmentation methods. In this study, we introduce a new game scene augmentation technique—named GameCLR—that takes advantage of the game-engine to define and synthesize specific, highly-controlled renderings of different game states, thereby, boosting contrastive learning performance. We test our GameCLR technique on images of the CARLA driving simulator environment and compare it against the popular SimCLR baseline SSL method. Our results suggest that GameCLR can infer the game’s state information from game footage more accurately compared to the baseline. Our proposed approach allows us to conduct game artificial intelligence research by directly utilizing screen pixels as input.","Trivedi, Chintan and Makantasis, Konstantinos and Liapis, Antonios and Yannakakis, Georgios N.","contrastive learning, representation learning, computer vision, game state representations, self-supervised learning",10.1145/3555858.3555902,2022,4

As a result, many students are struggling to keep up with the high demands of higher education institutions, and lecturers are under pressure to compensate for the lack of knowledge without lowering their standards. The struggle to keep up combined with personal worries, as well as doubts regarding studying in general, can lead to uncertainty and frustration. The MINT-KOMPASS project at our institution aims to support students of the STEM study courses during their first semesters and, therefore, tries to minimize problems early on. As part of the project, successive surveys were conducted as well as a statistical analysis of the development of the student's grades. In this paper, we present the results of both as well as two measures implemented to support the students in areas identified as problematic. With the surveys and measures, we try to better understand the needs of our students and, as a result, hope to eventually achieve our long-term goal of supporting the students and relieving the lecturers.","Benndorf, Maik and Kind, Gabriel and Siewerts, Hanna and Heinke, Florian and Schneider, Uwe",,10.1145/3442481.3442499,2021,7

inproceedings,Personal Learning Environments: Looking Back and Looking Forward,"In this paper I look back at the emergence of the idea of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and consider why they have failed to be widely adapted. I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits’ which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of ‘coping with finiteness’” and “seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity” as a response to the climate crisis. I suggest this could provide a point of reference for us to rethink Personal Learning Environment encompassing the ideas of equity and encompassing both radical pedagogies and the perspectives of previously marginalized interests and non-powerful groups.","Attwell, Graham","PLEs, equity in education, Personal Learning Environments, MOOCs, Open Education, agency in education",10.1145/3486011.3486504,2021,5

The device consists of four parts: sulfur hexafluoride gas chamber, solid insulator, defect simulator, observation and measurement device. The defect simulator can effectively simulate free metal particle discharge, tip discharge, suspension discharge and air gap discharge. A real-type integrated defect simulator based on GIS is developed, and the partial discharge signal is tested on the simulator, the change trend of decomposed gas with time is detected. Based on this, an artificial intelligence classification method combining fuzzy ISODATA algorithm and ant colony algorithm is proposed, and the structure parameters of the two algorithms are optimized by PSO algorithm. The field application results of HV combined electrical appliances show that the proposed method is effective. The fault type diagnosis method can effectively judge the fault mode intelligently according to time series of SF6 micro-decomposition gas and typical micro-decomposition gas. This paper not only collects the original classification data from the hardware platform of the defect simulator, but also develops an artificial intelligence classification algorithm software system which is easy to be programmed. It can be directly and effectively used to diagnose and evaluate the type of insulation defect in the field practical engineering of GIS.

Course through a Knowledge-Based Chatbot Workshop,"In this paper we share interim results of an ongoing mixed method evaluative study of 43 students enrolled in an elective course “Doing Business with A.I.” at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB), Singapore Management University. A key component of the course design is an experiential chatbot workshop that provides non-STEM students with an opportunity to acquire basic skills to build a chatbot prototype using the ‘Dialogflow’ program. The workshop and the experiential learning activity were designed to impart students with relevant knowledge and skills such as conversation and user-centric design know how and know why that are transferrable to other situational contexts beyond the course. Based on ongoing class surveys and qualitative interviews with students, we are trying to corroborate a conceptual model developed from learning theories and models related to technology mediated learning (TML) aimed at measuring the effects of a hands-on knowledge-based chatbot workshop designed by the authors on students’ engagement and motivation as drivers of acquiring AI-related competencies such as natural language processing skills (NLP). One important didactical aspect during the design and roll-out of the chatbot workshop is that novice learners with no or very little knowledge about A.I. recognize and create the important linkage between knowledge inputs and outputs of NLP-powered conversational agents (chatbots) so that user queries are effectively addressed. The knowledge-based chatbot workshop design as described in the paper provides useful practical information for instructors interested in designing educational chatbot prototypes for effective digital teaching and learning in a business school (higher education) context that can be transferred to other organizational units beyond the university (e.g. quality customer service) in order to make learners future-ready.","Menkhoff, Thomas and Lydia Teo, Ying Qian",Chatbots • Knowledge management • Student engagement,10.1145/3546157.3546175,2022,7

Knowledge tracking (KT) as a modeling method for learners to infer knowledge level based on their learning achievements, plays a key role in intelligent education system. There are some problems in the existing knowledge tracking models, such as incomplete input features and unstable model. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction of learners' learning effect, this paper proposes a deep knowledge tracking model (DDKT) based on the comprehensive difficulty of the topic. The model mainly includes two parts: on the one hand, the construction of the comprehensive difficulty model, on the other hand, the improvement of the model. The model combines topic difficulty with deep knowledge tracking model, enriches learners' learning process dimensions and improves the generalization ability of the model.

These automatically generated (AG) questions can be integrated with textbook content in a courseware environment so that students can practice as they read. Scaling this learn by doing method is a valuable pursuit, as it is proven to cause better learning outcomes (i.e., the doer effect). However, it is also necessary to ensure these AG questions perform equally as well as human-authored (HA) questions. In previous studies, it was found that AG and HA questions were essentially equivalent with respect to student engagement, difficulty, and persistence. While these question performance metrics expanded existing AQG research, this paper further extends this research by evaluating question discrimination using student data from a university Neuroscience course.

Today's entering college freshman are often already experienced with collaborative technologies and social computing systems, so it makes sense to consider introducing topics on socially intelligent computing in introductory computer science courses. This is because there is a clear connection between social computing and socially intelligent computing, and these topics might also provide some students with a new incentive to consider pursuing formal study in computer science.

I discuss a series of action research cycles focusing on the learning design of a student-centered introductory HCI short course that successfully sensitized students to the role of end-users in technology design. The learning design was planned to circumvent the challenging fact that HCI was underrated by CS students. Formative assessment results and my reflections, as the instructor, are discussed as well.","Lazem, Shaimaa","HCI education, emerging economies, Egypt, HCI4D, CS education, global south",,2019,15
inproceedings,The Role of Biased Data in Computerized Gender Discrimination,"Gender bias is prevalent in all walks of life from schools to colleges, corporate as well as government offices. This has led to the under-representation of the female gender in many professions. Most of the Artificial Intelligence-Natural Language Processing (AI-NLP) models learning from these underrepresented real world datasets amplify the bias in many cases, resulting in traditional biases being reinforced. In this paper, we have discussed how gender bias became ingrained in our society and how it results in the underrepresentation of the female gender in several fields such as education, healthcare, STEM, film industry, food industry, and sports. We shed some light on how traditional gender bias is reflected in AI-NLP systems such as automated resume screening, machine translation, text generation, etc. Future prospects of these AI-NLP applications need to include possible solutions to these existing biased AI-NLP applications, such as debiasing the word embeddings and having guidelines for more ethical and transparent standards.","Ahmed, Md.

inproceedings,Safe Reinforcement Learning in Simulated Environment of Self-Driving Laboratory,"Today we see tremendous potential in applying artificial intelligence (AI), deep reinforcement learning, and agent-based simulation to complex real-world problems. AI helps people support and automate decision-making penetrating almost all daily life aspects and research areas. One of the reasons for this potential is that AI helps us solve problems at a lower cost of resources and time. Materials research acceleration often relies upon AI using and automation of laboratory experiments, bringing significant fruitful results and advances. Self-driving laboratories include closed-loop chemistry experimentation and assist in designing new functional nanomaterials and optimizing their known parameters with AI and machine learning approaches. Due to the possibility of involving in the nanomaterials design process and some hazardous components, routine experimentation under chemists' continuous monitoring is usually required. Shifting to new intelligent technologies in self-driving laboratories with automated closed-loop experimentation requires excluding risks and accidents because of improper AI applications. This paper discusses safe deep reinforcement learning and its application in a simulated environment in self-driving laboratories experimenting with new functional materials. We proposed an approach to solving the problem of safe reinforcement learning by learning the intelligent agent to find a hidden reward and implemented that approach by constructing and using the heatmap from observation of the hidden reward neighborhood.","V.

article,Troi: Towards Understanding Users Perspectives to Mobile Automatic Emotion Recognition System in Their Natural Setting,"Emotional Self-Awareness (ESA) plays a vital role in physical and mental well-being. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have shown promising emotion recognition results, opening new opportunities to build systems to support ESA. However, little research has been done to understand users' perspectives on artificial-intelligence-based emotion recognition systems. We introduce Troi, an automatic emotion recognition mobile app using wearable signals. With Troi, we ran a multi-day user study with 12 users to understand user preference parameters, such as perceived accuracy, confidence, preferred emotion representations, effect of self-awareness of emotions, and real-time use cases. Further, we extend our study to evaluate the machine learning model in-the-wild to understand behaviours in-the-wild. We found that users perceived accuracy of the emotion recognition model is higher than the actual model prediction accuracy; there was no strong preference for one specific emotion representation, and users' self-awareness of emotions improved over time.","Dissanayake, Vipula and Tang, Vanessa and Elvitigala, Don Samitha and Wen, Elliott and Wu, Michelle and Nanayakkara, Suranga","automatic emotion recognition, mobile application, in-the-wild study, physiological signals",10.1145/3546738,2022,22

inproceedings,Assumed Digital Literacy Knowledge by Australian Universities: Are Students Informed?,"As disruptive technologies make an impact in the workplace, employers are demanding a broader range of skills that go beyond the capabilities that graduates have developed through their higher education studies. Further, digital literacy is increasingly being recognised as an essential skill, on a par with literacy and numeracy, to support job readiness. As a result there is increasing pressure on universities to ensure their courses prepare graduates appropriately, but is digital literacy amongst these skills? The first step to address this question is to gain an understanding of what universities' expectations are of a student's assumed digital literacy knowledge, the foundation from which graduate digital capabilities are built. The aim of this study is to investigate what information Australian universities provide to prospective students to inform them of the expectations of assumed digital literacy knowledge when entering a course. Based on a sample of 13 Australian universities it seems that minimal information is being provided to new students. This study demonstrates that there is no shared understanding of what digital literacy entails, which poses challenges for students who are expected to have an ill-defined and in some instances, unknown set of digital skills. It also challenges relationships between staff and students, as expectations and understanding of digital skills are not aligned.","Coldwell-Neilson, Jo","higher education, Digital literacy, assumed knowledge",10.1145/3013499.3013505,2017,6

inproceedings,Correlations between Automated Rhetorical Analysis and Tutors' Grades on Student Essays,"When assessing student essays, educators look for the students' ability to present and pursue well-reasoned and strong arguments. Such scholarly argumentation is often articulated by rhetorical metadiscourse. Educators will be necessarily examining metadiscourse in students' writing as signals of the intellectual moves that make their reasoning visible. Therefore students and educators could benefit from available powerful automated textual analysis that is able to detect rhetorical metadiscourse. However, there is a need to validate such technologies in higher education contexts, since they were originally developed in non-educational applications. This paper describes an evaluation study of a particular language analysis tool, the Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP), on undergraduate social science student essays, using the mark awarded as a measure of the quality of the writing.

inproceedings,Towards an Operationalization of AI Acceptance among Pre-Service Teachers,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its popularity in many fields of our life, ranging from song recommendation to lung cancer identification. CSE can impart AI knowledge to all people (including teachers) so that they can make an informed decision about AI. Besides, AI technologies can support tailoring the education to the students’ needs or unload teachers by doing routine work for them and leaving more space for creativity. However, despite the growing potential of AI applications in education, some skepticism or even rejection can be observed. It could be especially critical for teacher education: by being a role model for pupils, teachers could multiply their attitude towards AI while transferring it to the pupils. Although AI acceptance is broadly investigated in the marketing context, there is not much prior research on AI acceptance among teachers. Besides, AI acceptance as a term is questionable due to the heterogeneity of the AI field. We highlight the research gap, propose an instrument for the data collection, and introduce the idea of the acceptance spectrum. The proposed concept is exemplified by the case study of acceptance of the AI-supported homework assessment among pre-service teachers.","Chikobava, Margarita and Romeike, Ralf","Artificial Intelligence (AI) acceptance, Computer Science Education (CSE), Artificial Intelligence (AI) education",10.1145/3481312.3481349,2021,2

These human-autonomy teams call for deep integration between artificial intelligence and the human workers that make up a majority of the workforce. This paper identifies the core principles of the human-autonomy teaming literature relevant to the integration of human-autonomy teams in applied contexts and research due to this large scale implementation of human-autonomy teams. A framework is built and defined from these fundamental concepts, with specific examples of its use in applied contexts and the interactions between various components of the framework. This framework can be utilized by practitioners of human-autonomy teams, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding the integration and training of human-autonomy teams.","Schelble, Beau G. and Flathmann, Christopher and McNeese, Nathan","artificial intelligence, theoretical framework, human-autonomy interaction, teaming, human-autonomy teaming, applied artificial intelligence",10.1145/3406499.3415077,2020,8
inproceedings,Developing an Adaptive AI Agent Using Supervised and Reinforcement Learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search in FightingICE,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are efficient algorithms for video game artificial intelligence (AI) agents, while Supervised Learning (SL) would make a video game AI agent visual-based. Combining SL and RL with MCTS has been tested in Computer Go, but this has yet to be thoroughly explored for fighting games. FightingICE, a 2D fighting game, serves as an ideal testing environment because of its complex action and observation spaces. In this paper, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Q-Learning with MCTS (DQCN with MCTS) to create three models for FightingICE and compare their performance with an MCTS agent when playing against the same set of human testers. Our best performing model achieved a 58.57% game win-rate in 70 testing games after 7 training games. Although the model did not beat the MCTS agent's performance, it demonstrates the potential of combining SL, RL, and MCTS to develop an AI agent for fighting games.","Q. Tomas, John Paul and R.

As our society relies more on artificial intelligence (AI), the security of AI, especially the machine learning algorithms, becomes increasingly important and remains largely untested. Adversarial machine learning, on the other hand, attempts to defeat machine learning models through malicious input. In this paper, we experiment how adversarial scenario may impact the security of machine learning based mechanisms such as email spam filters. Using natural language processing (NLP) and Baysian model as an example, we developed and tested three invasive techniques, i.e., synonym replacement, ham word injection and spam word spacing. Our adversarial examples and results suggest that these techniques are effective in fooling the machine learning models.

However, the use of computer simulation to study the effects of climate change on human conflict and cooperation is still relatively rare. In this article, we consider some of the challenges and opportunities that face interdisciplinary teams seeking to develop models that incorporate human, ecological, and natural systems. There is an urgency to this task because climate-abetted socio-economic and inter-cultural stress can trigger conflict at all scales, which exacerbates human suffering. We argue that the interdisciplinary community of scholars with expertise in multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation and artificial life modeling have a unique opportunity to collaborate and address these challenges by attempting to develop artificial societies capable of uncovering adaptive pathways that can minimize social conflict and maximize cooperation in the face of climate-abetted social and ecological change.","Shults, F.

article,Creative Problem Solving in Artificially Intelligent Agents: A Survey and Framework,"Creative Problem Solving (CPS) is a sub-area within Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on methods for solving off-nominal, or anomalous problems in autonomous systems. Despite many advancements in planning and learning, resolving novel problems or adapting existing knowledge to a new context, especially in cases where the environment may change in unpredictable ways post deployment, remains a limiting factor in the safe and useful integration of intelligent systems. The emergence of increasingly autonomous systems dictates the necessity for AI agents to deal with environmental uncertainty through creativity.

But technologies in education go beyond the simple use of video lectures: technologies might be exploited to improve personal learning. In this paper, we focus on the dropout of studies, a global phenomenon that artificial intelligence techniques are trying to ameliorate.

We consider first-year students enrolled in our Department and we characterize them with personal, scholastic, academic and technological features. Then, we measure the performance of three machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. The experimental evaluation shows that Random Forest and KNN perform better that Decision Tree and also shows that data related to the use of video lectures improves the prediction performance for some degree programs (reaching 73% in terms of accuracy and sensitivity).

inproceedings,Efficient Data Processing Method for Edge Intelligence Based on SVM,"Recently, edge intelligence is emerging. It is widely used because it allows you to make business models more efficient through edge intelligence, but there is still a lack of models to use for edge intelligence. Artificial neural networks are being used a lot because they solve the problem of overfitting, which is a disadvantage of artificial neural networks and increase the speed by improving GPU performance. However as the independent variable to be learned increases, the learning time and characteristics of the artificial neural network slow down and the size of the neural network becomes very heavier. The shortage of these artificial neural networks make it difficult to make edge intelligence for classification or prediction in real life. Manufacturing lightweight models using heavy neural networks and high-performance GPUs also presents a lot of financial problems. However, SVM based on statistical mathematics exists between machine learning. Although it is relatively inferior to artificial intelligence, it is better light and has stable performing. To do this, we propose an efficient data processing method that improves the characteristics of the SVM (the overall performance, accuracy and learning speed of the SVM) and makes it easier for the SVM to learn the data. When four types of data processing were applied, the accuracy increased by more than 0.4% for the iris data set and 2% on average for the other data sets, and the training time for all data sets was also reduced. As a result, SVMs that can process data efficiently are much lighter than artificial neural networks and have very good training times versus accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient data processing method based on SVM for edge intelligence.","Jung, Namgyu and Yoon, Junho and Mutombo, Kazadi Vially and Lee, Seungyeon and Lee, Jusuk and Choi, Chang","Multicollinearity, Data preprocessing, Edge intelligence, Variance Inflation factor, Standard Scaler, Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest",10.1145/3440943.3444728,2021,6

inproceedings,South Korean Public Value Coproduction Towards‘AI for Humanity’: A Synergy of Sociocultural Norms and Multistakeholder Deliberation in Bridging the Design and Implementation of National AI Ethics Guidelines,"As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.","Ha, You Jeen","Deliberative democracy, 4IR, Sociocultural norms, Public value, Artificial intelligence, Networked governance, AI policy, National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, South Korea, AI ethics, Multistakeholder",10.1145/3531146.3533091,2022,11

The choice for a representation model and data-structures is a crucial design decision that affects the selection of an algorithmic solution as well as the suitableness for artificial intelligence agents. This survey focuses on the different schemes and data structures used to represent game states, physical components, players, actions and rules for digital board games that have been reported in the academic literature. This study aims to lay the groundwork for the development of a game-independent computational framework which includes a generic game representation to facilitate and promote the application of computational techniques such as, for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning to this domain.","de Araujo, Luiz Jonata Pires and Charikova, Mariia and Sales, Juliano Efson and Smirnov, Vladislav and Thapaliya, Ananga","game states, board games, knowledge representation, data structures",10.1145/3337722.3342238,2019,8
inproceedings,"""All Rise for the AI Director"": Eliciting Possible Futures of Voice Technology through Story Completion","How might the capabilities of voice assistants several decades in the future shape human society? To anticipate the space of possible futures for voice assistants, we asked 149 participants to each complete a story based on a brief story stem set in the year 2050 in one of five different contexts: the home, doctor's office, school, workplace, and public transit. Story completion as a method elicits participants' visions of possible futures, unconstrained by their understanding of current technological capabilities, but still reflective of current sociocultural values. Through a thematic analysis, we find these stories reveal the extremes of the capabilities and concerns of today's voice assistants---and artificial intelligence---such as improving efficiency and offering instantaneous support, but also replacing human jobs, eroding human agency, and causing harm through malfunction. We conclude by discussing how these speculative visions might inform and inspire the design of voice assistants and other artificial intelligence.","Cambre, Julia and Reig, Samantha and Kravitz, Queenie and Kulkarni, Chinmay","voice assistant, speculative design, conversational user interface, story completion, cui",10.1145/3357236.3395479,2020,14

inproceedings,Vision Paper: Causal Inference for Interpretable and Robust Machine Learning in Mobility Analysis,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many areas of our lives, leading a new era of technological advancement. Particularly, the transportation sector would benefit from the progress in AI and advance the development of intelligent transportation systems. Building intelligent transportation systems requires an intricate combination of artificial intelligence and mobility analysis. The past few years have seen rapid development in transportation applications using advanced deep neural networks. However, such deep neural networks are difficult to interpret and lack robustness, which slows the deployment of these AI-powered algorithms in practice. To improve their usability, increasing research efforts have been devoted to developing interpretable and robust machine learning methods, among which the causal inference approach recently gained traction as it provides interpretable and actionable information. Moreover, most of these methods are developed for image or sequential data which do not satisfy specific requirements of mobility data analysis. This vision paper emphasizes research challenges in deep learning-based mobility analysis that require interpretability and robustness, summarizes recent developments in using causal inference for improving the interpretability and robustness of machine learning methods, and highlights opportunities in developing causally-enabled machine learning models tailored for mobility analysis. This research direction will make AI in the transportation sector more interpretable and reliable, thus contributing to safer, more efficient, and more sustainable future transportation systems.","Xin, Yanan and Tagasovska, Natasa and Perez-Cruz, Fernando and Raubal, Martin","mobility analysis, causal inference, machine learning, interpretability, robustness",10.1145/3557915.3561473,2022,4
article,Viewpoint: AI as Author – Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Literary Theory,"Anticipating the rise in Artificial Intelligence’s ability to produce original works of literature, this study suggests that literariness, or that which constitutes a text as literary, is understudied in relation to text generation. From a computational perspective, literature is particularly challenging because it typically employs figurative and ambiguous language. Literary expertise would be beneficial to understanding how meaning and emotion are conveyed in this art form but is often overlooked. We propose placing experts from two dissimilar disciplines – machine learning and literary studies – in conversation to improve the quality of AI writing. Concentrating on evaluation as a vital stage in the text generation process, the study demonstrates that benefit could be derived from literary theoretical perspectives. This knowledge would improve algorithm design and enable a deeper understanding of how AI learns and generates.

inproceedings,AI + Dance: Co-Designing Culturally Sustaining Curricular Resources for AI and Ethics Education Through Artistic Computing,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems are ubiquitous across many fields ranging from medicine (e.g., tumor detection), to natural language processing (e.g., digital home assistants, auto-translate tools), and personalization (e.g., social media recommendations). The rise of these systems has also seen a rise in the ethical challenges resulting from how some of these systems are designed and implemented. Most problematic is their propagation and amplification of problems such as racism and sexism [4, 6], among others. Further, these challenges exist within a computing discipline that is already burdened by exclusive, marginalizing cultures and practices that lead to low participation by women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) [3]. Our project, AI + Dance, attends to these dimensions of inequity within AI/ML education through developing our understanding of how we can equip learners to recognize and rectify issues of AI and ML systems within an inclusive and culturally sustaining experience. We explore this in collaboration with STEM From Dance1 (SFD), a non-profit organization that supports girls of color in creative production with dance, CS, and STEM. In our prior work with SFD, we developed danceON, an open-access creative coding environment that enables learners to create code to engage authentically with dance and body motion [5]. With danceON, learners can code animations that can bind and respond to body positions and be statically and dynamically positioned in space. The system provides two ways to explore AI and ML. First, it integrates a pose detection machine learning model (PoseNet [8]) that consists of body points (i.e., Left Ear, Nose, etc.) and confidence scores for these key points, which are all accessible within the code. Second, danceON enables learners to import a model trained in Google’s Teachable Machine [2] to access the probabilistic classifier to manipulate and trigger animations. While we have explored the use of danceON to enable learners to build culturally relevant artistic artifacts [5], we have yet to explore how we can teach AI and ML concepts and ethics through the use of the system. We investigate two research questions through the co-design of culturally sustaining AI/ML resources with teachers: RQ1) How can we authentically build on learners’ identities, cultural knowledge, and practices with dance as they build, explore, and critique ML and AI models and systems? RQ2) How can we leverage learners’ creative, embodied experiences with ML and AI to facilitate reflection and critique of CS and AI/ML within their communities and society more broadly? We focus on co-design as a method that facilitates sustainability through centering teachers’ values, ownership, and authentic contexts in the realization, implementation, and evaluation of learning designs [7]. Through co-designing curricular resources, we will develop a set of modules aligned with the AI4K12 guidelines [1] that builds our understanding of creating culturally sustaining educational resources to teach about AI and ethical design in ways that leverage the culturally situated, collaborative, and embodied nature of dance.","Castro, Francisco Enrique Vicente and DesPortes, Kayla and Payne, William and Bergner, Yoav and McDermott, Kathleen","Machine learning, Artistic computing, AI ethics, Creative computing, Artificial intelligence, danceON, Dance",10.1145/3501709.3544275,2022,2

inproceedings,"A Scenario-Based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics","Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.","Li, Xiaotian Vivian and Rosson, Mary Beth and Robert, Jenay","learning analytics, higher education, privacy, scenarios, adoption, instructors, survey, design",10.1145/3491140.3528271,2022,12

article,Artificial Intelligence in Underwater Digital Twins Sensor Networks,"The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.","Lv, Zhihan and Chen, Dongliang and Feng, Hailin and Wei, Wei and Lv, Haibin","underwater sensor networks, digital twins, Marine monitoring, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3519301,2022,27

Since 2010, game AI researchers have hosted annual AI competition events to develop human-level RTS AIs using StarCraft. It ranks the AI bots by their winning ratio from thousands of AI vs. AI matches without human involvement. It is questionable whether successful AI bots are also competitive and preferable to human players. In this study, we invited 20 experienced players with varying expertise to evaluate skill levels, overall performance and human likeness of AI bots. Results show that human's ranking of AI bots are not identical to the current one from AI competitions. It suggests the need for developing new AI competitions that consider human factors (""human-likeness"" or ""adaptation"").

inproceedings,Paraconsistent Annotated Logic Artificial Intelligence Study in Support of Manager Decision-Making,"The philosopher Aristotle seeks the definition of man as a political being, responsible for making decisions. Political decisions generate changes in their environment and in producing change they seek constant adaptations, which in turn leads to contradictions, inconsistencies, truths, falsehoods. So soon, studies of the non-classical logical calls [2] have become a tool as an aid in the making of decisions. The logic calls attention to the brilliance of containing provisions contrary to some of the basic principles of Aristotelian Logic, such as the contradiction. In this article, the use of the technology allows proposing a structured decision making contained in the unified process Paraconsistent Logic. The unified process Paraconsistent Logic aims to be a facilitator in supporting the construction of the decision support and adherent the Paraconsistent Decision Method proposed in the studies with announcements for project recount in the function point analysis technique. A network of paraconsistent analysis can be used applications focused on the use of artificial intelligence, situations that the classic logic does not meet in its fullness, for the simple fact of operating with only two states, true or false, paraconsistent has a lot of room to deal with data inconsistencies and with real-world uncertainties.","de Lima, Alessandro W.

inproceedings,"Integrating Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion throughout the Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence in Health","Health care systems are the infrastructures that are put together to deliver health and social services to the population at large. These organizations are increasingly applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care. Unfortunately, both health care systems and AI are confronted with a lack of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). This short paper focuses on the importance of integrating EDI concepts throughout the life cycle of AI in health. We discuss the risks that the lack of EDI in the design, development and implementation of AI-based tools might have on the already marginalized communities and populations in the healthcare setting. Moreover, we argue that integrating EDI principles and practice throughout the lifecycle of AI in health has an important role in achieving health equity for all populations. Further research needs to be conducted to explore how studies in AI-health have integrated.","Nyariro, Milka and Emami, Elham and Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi, Samira","Ethics, Health Equity, Health systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)",10.1145/3532530.3539565,2022,4
inproceedings,Information Digitization and Artificial Intelligence Applied in Smart Car HCI Development,"Today's digitalization has become a staple of life, and consumers' escalating digital lifestyles and demand for convenient services are directly driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. The car will no longer be a single-function transport but will become an intelligent mobile terminal providing mobility services. The influx of digital services into the car will result in a dramatic transformation of the relationship between the driver and the car, where the car will act as an intelligent mobile terminal to transfer and communicate information with people or the surrounding environment, which will lead to an explosion of information in the car, and due to the limitations of human information processing capabilities, this may make the currently established design of human-computer interaction in the car no longer applicable. If we continue to view the human-vehicle relationship through the lens of a control-oriented machine interface, this will place strong constraints on the design of intelligent human-vehicle interaction. The core of the future intelligent vehicle HCI field is a richer and more diverse information interaction between vehicle, human, and environment, so changing the concept from HCI to human-vehicle information interaction may well support the development of future intelligent vehicle systems. In this article, the exploitation of a human-vehicle interaction assistance system for the handover of control of a vehicle under conditional automation is used as an example to discuss how human information interaction is applicable to the automotive domain.","Chen, Keqi and Ma, Jun and Zhang, Yiming","Drive takeover, Human information interaction, Cognitive work analysis, HCI, Human-vehicle interaction",10.1145/3495018.3501063,2022,4
inproceedings,"AI and Us: Ethical Concerns, Public Knowledge and Public Attitudes on Artificial Intelligence","In the first part I present a theoretical study of ethical challenges arising from the development and application of AI, while in the second part I present an empirical study of public attitudes towards the various aspects of AI use, which I have conducted. Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems that mimic human cognitive functions and that are designed to achieve specific goals, execute tasks, make decisions or achieve goals in complex situations autonomously.AI can greatly facilitate people's daily and business lives, but it also brings challenges, such as privacy, transparency, discrimination, job loss, and responsibility. One of the main challenges related to the adoption and implementation of AI is the current connotations and perceptions of the subject. To some people, AI is a mysterious concept, and it is difficult to understand how it manifests in their daily lives. The development and application of AI raise several ethical issues, including the interaction of AI with human rights such as privacy and discrimination [2]. Previous studies [1, 3-5] have examined some aspects of AI. In this study, I have employed a new scale to measure the general attitudes of the public towards AI.I have conducted an empirical study of public attitudes towards various aspects of the use of AI. The participants were the public in Serbia (N=737) who filled out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of general socio-demographic questions, questions about familiarity with AI, a brief introduction to the concept of AI, and questions about participants' attitudes towards the use of AI. Participants were asked to what degree they (dis)agree with the statements on the 5-point Likert scale. I have investigated whether age, education, previous knowledge of AI, profession, and level of religiosity influences people's attitudes towards AI. Objectives were to (1) examine the public's attitudes in Serbia toward the use of AI; (2) determine which factors influence these attitudes; (3) examine whether the public shares the concerns identified by ethical philosophers in the debates on AI; (4) examine prior knowledge of the public on AI. Data were analyzed in the R programming language. The general attitude towards the use of AI was assessed by creating a composite score based on the questions in which the respondents expressed their attitudes towards different aspects of the use of AI.The results showed that the public in Serbia has a divided opinion on the use of AI. Half of them have positive, and the other half negative attitudes. These attitudes are influenced by variables such as the respondents' age, education, profession, level of religiosity, and prior knowledge of AI, in a way that young, highly educated, non-religious, those with highly qualified jobs, especially IT professionals, and those who are more familiar with the concept of AI, have more positive attitudes towards the use of AI. Also, the results showed that the public is concerned about the disappearance of professions due to the development of AI and discrimination by AI systems. The results suggest a need to educate the public about challenges and ways to prevent them. It is necessary to increase transparency in decision-making processes related to the implementation of AI and dialogue between the public on the one hand and the state and the private sector on the other. I argue that considering different aspects of public attitudes toward AI enhances this debate. The results are valuable for future work on this topic because similar public opinion polls have not been conducted, especially not in Serbia. Public opinion has not shaped conversations about the use of AI. Another focus should be on further research of the attitudes of the public and experts on specific applications of AI and related ethical challenges. This research has implications for future research, particularly when forming an AI attitude scale.","Budic, Marina","ethical concerns, knowledge, public attitudes, AI",10.1145/3514094.3539518,2022,1
inproceedings,Evaluation of Level 2 Automated Driving Artificial Intelligence Readiness in Simulated Scenarios,"Recent advances in state-of-the-art camera-based AI mechanisms in the automated driving field have leveraged great progress in the installation and widespread use of this technology along the recent years. However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.","Tena-Gago, David and Wang, Qi and Alcaraz-Calero, Jose M.","AI, Camera-based detection, Perception, ADAS",10.1145/3568160.3570232,2022,8

article,Performance-Driven X-Architecture Routing Algorithm&nbsp;for Artificial Intelligence Chip Design in Smart Manufacturing,"The new 7-nm Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip is an important milestone recently announced by the IBM research team, with a very important optimization goal of performance. This chip technology can be extended to various business scenarios in the Internet of Things. As the basic model for very large scale integration routing, the Steiner minimal tree can be used in various practical problems, such as wirelength optimization and timing closure. Further considering the X-architecture and the routing resources within obstacles, an effective performance-driven X-architecture routing algorithm for AI chip design in smart manufacturing is proposed to improve the delay performance of the chip. First, a special particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the discrete length-restricted X-architecture Steiner minimum tree problem in combination with genetic operations, and a particle encoding scheme is presented to encode each particle into an initial routing tree. Second, two lookup tables based on pins and obstacles are established to provide a fast information query for the whole algorithm flow. Third, a strategy of candidate point selection is designed to make the particles satisfy the constraints. Finally, a refinement strategy is implemented to further improve the quality of the final routing tree. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a better total wirelength, which is an important index of performance, thus better satisfying the demand for delay performance of AI chip design in smart manufacturing.","Liu, Genggeng and Zhu, Yuhan and Xu, Saijuan and Tang, Hao and Chen, Yeh-Cheng","X-architecture routing, Steiner minimal tree, refinement strategy, particle swarm optimization, resource relaxation, Artificial intelligence chip design, smart manufacturing",10.1145/3519422,2022,20
inproceedings,Owners of Artificial Intelligence Systems Are More Easily Blamed Compared with System Designers in Moral Dilemma Tasks,"Due to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI is now getting implemented in various kinds of robotic systems. When implementing AI in robotic systems, there are roughly two approaches; one is AI implemented in a robotic system that controls the system independently, and the other is external AI located somewhere else that controls the system in a tele-operated manner. An investigation was thus conducted into how people judge moral wrongness in a system and in its designers and owners regarding these two different types of AI and action consequences.

A healthy and sustainable higher education system can effectively improve the country's competitiveness. The establishment of a complete and unified model for evaluating the pros and cons of the national higher education system is the basis for improving the level of the higher education system. In this article, we will build the relevant model in four steps. The first step is to search for documents and data, and use data on factors such as knowledge protection in multiple countries, higher education enrollment rates, education system quality, student Internet access, government education expenditures, the number of citations per paper, and the value of degrees. Build a model based on it. And standardize all data. In the second step, since the factors may have a certain correlation, the principal component analysis method is used to convert the equi-related variables into another set of unrelated variables and establish a model. The third step is to analyze the health and sustainability levels of higher education systems in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries based on this model, and obtain rankings and comprehensive scores. The fourth step is to use the entropy method to calculate the specific weight of each factor. Select one of the countries to reform the most weighted factor.

article,Why Real Citizens Would Turn to Artificial Leaders,"Governments are increasingly using artificial intelligence to improve workflows and services. Applications range from predicting climate change, crime, and earthquakes to flu outbreaks, low air quality, and tax fraud. Artificial agents are already having an impact on eldercare, education, and open government, enabling users to complete procedures through a conversational interface. Whether replacing humans or assisting them, they are the technological fix of our times. In two experiments and a follow-up study, we investigate factors that influence the acceptance of artificial agents in positions of power, using attachment theory and disappointment theory as explanatory models. We found that when the state of the world provokes anxiety, citizens perceive artificial agents as a reliable proxy to replace human leaders. Moreover, people accept artificial agents as decision-makers in politics and security more willingly when they deem their leaders or government to be untrustworthy, disappointing, or immoral. Finally, we discuss these results with respect to theories of technology acceptance and the delegation of duties and prerogatives.","Spatola, Nicolas and Macdorman, Karl F.","attitudes, artificial intelligence, technology acceptance, trust, competence, Agents",10.1145/3447954,2021,24

inproceedings,Hot Topics of Big Data Research in China,"This paper aims at exploring the hot topics of big data research in China in the past three years. We choose Big Data, one influential and representative Chinese academic journal as our data source, and download the bibliographic data of 195 articles published in the past three years on this journal from CNKI. In order to gain the general overview of Chinese big data research status quo, we count the high frequency words and distribution of publish years. From the high frequency words list, we can tell that the times of mentions of ""data"" is far more than that of other frequency words, which verifies the fact that data is the most important concept in big data research. In order to extract the hot topics of big data research, we adopt LDA model to generate topics of the 195 research articles. With several experiments, we set the topic number as seven for the best outcome quality. With expert suggestion, we label the seven topics as ""Big data helps government decisions"", ""Internet and management"","" Artificial intelligence helps public security"","" Big data promotes information"", ""Big data governance"", ""Artificial intelligence and 5G"","" Big data prediction"" based on the high frequency words in each topic. Most of the topic labels are linked to 5G, artificial intelligence and other modern techniques, which implies that the big data plays a necessary role in empowering the future techniques.

inproceedings,Visual Gorgias: A Mechanism for the Visualization of an Argumentation Dialogue,"The area of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been given great attention during the last decade, due to the obscurity that exists on how a data-driven model makes a decision. One idea in order to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems more explainable is to use cognitive methods that humans use when reasoning. For instance, argumentation is a common method that humans use when they explain an opinion [13]. In this paper, we introduce a framework that produces the visualization of an explanation from an argumentation dialogue, and can be easily understood by any user. More specifically, we utilize the argumentation tree that Gorgias returns [7] for the acceptability of an argument, to create a graph that represents the explanation of the argumentation tree.","Vassiliades, Alexandros and Papadimitriou, Ilias and Bassiliades, Nick and Patkos, Theodore","Argumentation, Explainability, Visualization, Argumentation Dialogue",10.1145/3503823.3503852,2022,6

Several of the current mainstream online translation tools for translating English literature related to health management education have been tested. The knowledge of health management translated by the online translation tool is translated into the mother tongue for the evaluation of the students’ cognitive ability of the relevant knowledge. The online questionnaire was used to provide feedback on students’ understanding and mastery of health management knowledge translated into their native language. The mainstream online translation tools already allow students to translate basic health education materials into their native language. The mainstream translation tools with the assistance of artificial intelligence can achieve high accuracy in the translation of short sentences in health education materials. The results show that the online translation of health education materials from non-native language to native language can basically enable students to obtain the correct understanding of health education materials. Of course, converting long sentences in health education materials into short sentences to improve the accuracy of intelligent translation tools can effectively improve the cognitive effect.

Through the comparison with the study of computational linguistics, it is also found that students' understanding of lexical chunk is basic, and it is reasonable to infer that students can not fully grasp the lexical chunks used in the daily communication in terms of the proper forms and the pragmatic functions, and misusing happens fairly frequently. The study highlights the significance of integrating the teaching mode which involves lexical chunk specifically in English textbooks and lectures for EFL, especially for students with a relatively low language proficiency.","CUI, YAN",,10.1109/ICBDIE52740.2021.00097,2021,4

article,Teaching Machine Learning in K–12 Classroom: Pedagogical and Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education,"Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.","Tedre, Matti and Toivonen, Tapani and Kahila, Juho and Vartiainen, Henriikka and Valtonen, Teemu and Jormanainen, Ilkka and Pears, Arnold",,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962,2021,15

These are the characteristics of management accounting. If accountants are simply proficient in finance, they lack the connection with business, do not understand business, and cannot extract valuable information from financial big data to provide solutions or suggestions for business development, which is a waste of data resources and even misleading decision-making. Today&#x0027;s finance should not only integrate into business, but also deal with data, so as to give full play to the functions of supervision and management decision-making, help improve business quality, and at the same time, make value creation develop to a higher end. The important task of higher education is to train high-quality professionals and cultivate a group of top-notch talents in this major. The same is true of management accounting [1]. At present, there is a shortage of market management accounting talents. How to cultivate high-quality management accounting talents, improve the practical ability of management accounting students, and quickly integrate into society to be a qualified management accounting, the key to professional teaching is to make students familiar with business and understand business processes, and to have management practice courses with quality and quantity.","Wu, Yanhong",,10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00035,2021,4

inproceedings,Improving Equity and Access to Higher Education Using Artificial Intelligence,"With data on education becoming more available, it has created a strong link between big data and learning analytics. This link paved the way for researchers in these fields to address several issues within higher education. In this study, we address the inequity in higher education, which is a long standing issue, that is depriving many skilled people of the fundamental right of education due to their background, gender, race, ethnicity or social class. Research has shown that deprived groups in terms of their demographics are more likely to fail. In this regard, we propose to use a deep neural network (DNN) that aims to predict students’ final results. This prior knowledge of students’ outcome could be used in favor of underprivileged groups in order to assist and enhance their chances to be successful. The conceived DNN consists of a binary classifier that is trained on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, with the aim to classify students into two categories: fail or pass, given a specific module and based on their demographics and interaction with the virtual learning environment. The obtained results are promising and show that deep learning could be an effective tool to promote equity in higher education. Moreover, they reveal that this latter is also a powerful tool for exploring big data within learning analytics, provided that deep neural networks become more accurate when they are provided with additional data.","Cheddadi, Saoussen and Bouache, Mourad",,10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569548,2021,6

inproceedings,OJ Intelligent Training System based on Artificial Intelligence for Hierarchical Personalized Teaching,"This paper introduces a new feature of the OJ system at Donghua University: intelligent training. Compared to other OJ systems, our OJ has the following features: 1) A clustering algorithm is used to classify the problems. When a student completes a category of problems, he or she passes a level and is awarded the corresponding score. 2) The system intelligently determines whether a student can pass the level or not. Generally, students with higher abilities need to complete fewer problems but receive higher scores. 3) The system uses a classification algorithm to determine whether plagiarism has occurred based on the code submitted by the student and the behavioral characteristics of the student at the time of submission, thus preventing plagiarism as much as possible. 4) The system uses a BP neural network to predict students' final exam scores, and then uses that predicted value as a point for reflecting ability to enhance students' sense of achievement in completing the practices. The OJ intelligent training model, based on the above features, allows students to train themselves at different levels according to their ability. Weaker students can practice more at lower levels to strengthen their foundation, while stronger students can practice more at higher levels to compete in competitions. This achieves the goal of personalized teaching at different levels and achieves better teaching results.","Huang, Qiubo and Liu, Zixuan and Lu, Ting",,10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00044,2021,6
