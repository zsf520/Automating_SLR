inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges for the Public Sector,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which ""intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity"" [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.","Susar, Deniz and Aquaro, Vincenzo","E-government, Public Sector, Digital Government, Artificial Intelligence, Public Administration, Sustainable Development Goals",10.1145/3326365.3326420,2019,9
article,"Artificial Intelligence: The Societal Responsibility to Inform, Educate, and Regulate","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field; one that is mysterious to the general public. The mention of the word AI fills the imaginations of many with thoughts of talking robots, jobs being replaced, and possibly even the destruction of mankind. Perhaps imaginations are running wild due to, perhaps driven by the loose definition of AI as systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence that allows Hollywood to take some creative license. The experts in the field tend to work directly with AI and often for large companies, allowing for the imagination and news headlines to be where the public gets their information. Many wonder if this new technology is going to be an overall benefit to society or if it will bring unmitigated disaster. When the imagination runs wild, instead of understanding, news stories can perpetuate concerns and anxieties rather than hope and optimism.","Hilton, Alexander D.",No data,10.1145/3362077.3362088,2019,7
inproceedings,Simulation for Higher Education Sustainability: A Growing Institution Case Study,"We propose to reduce the complexity of sustainable development when we apply the simulation paradigm to a higher education institution by using a decomposition of both sustainability and the institution. It opens the possibilities to formalize their partial components and to identify many meaningful relationships among them. We formalized such relationships as a set of specific processes that we used in the created simulation case study. We consider the simulation models created within the case study as a tool to support higher education institution sustainability. In the simulation case study, we analyzed the faculty-students relationship described by the related institution admission processes. The simulation case study is connected with economic-constituent relations sustainability metrics. The simulation case study has been applied at a young fast growing higher education institution in the United States.","Kurkovsky, Anatoly","simulation case study, higher education, sustainable development",No data,2017,10
article,Developing an Intelligent Cloud for Higher Education,"With rapid development in the IT world, technologies are becoming more dynamic and advanced. Today, technologies are changing with customer requirements. In the IT world, research is carried out to make technology better to meet the requirements that change with time. With the advancement in the IT world, online services have proliferated. Now a days, cloud computing is the hottest buzzword in the IT world. Cloud computing is not limited to the E-Governance and business worlds, but is also making a great impact in the education world. With growing demand for education, technologies and research, all universities and education institutions have their eyes on cloud computing. The main pillars of educational institutions are students, faculties, administrations and libraries. Faculty and students do research and need quality data while students of a particular field need a subject-oriented knowledge. Manually getting these kinds of data is time consuming as students depend on literature, books, different kind of software and hardware. With cloud computing in higher education, cost-effective measures can be taken to minimize the dependency on books, hardware and software. In this paper, we discuss how Artifical Intelligence based cloud computing in higher education will improve quality and ease the process of getting e-resources (software/hardware platform, storage etc.). This study will help in understanding effective cost-cutting measures. We also discuss how cloud computing in the library and administration will brighten the education prospects.","Yadav, Nikita and Khatri, Sujata and Singh, V.

inproceedings,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Lawyer's Perspective","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a research direction that was already put under scrutiny, in particular in the AI&amp;Law community. Whilst there were notable developments in the area of (general, not necessarily legal) XAI, user experience studies regarding such methods, as well as more general studies pertaining to the concept of explainability among the users are still lagging behind. This paper firstly, assesses the performance of different explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP), in explaining the predictions for a legal text classification problem; those explanations were then judged by legal professionals according to their accuracy. Secondly, the same respondents were asked to give their opinion on the desired qualities of (explainable) artificial intelligence (AI) legal decision system and to present their general understanding of the term XAI. This part was treated as a pilot study for a more pronounced one regarding the lawyer's position on AI, and XAI in particular.","G\'{o}rski, \L{}ukasz and Ramakrishna, Shashishekar","grad-CAM, SHAP, survey, XAI, LIME, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3462757.3466145,2021,9
inproceedings,Nordic Cities Meet Artificial Intelligence: City Officials’ Views on Artificial Intelligence and Citizen Data in Finland,"In this paper, we explore Finnish city officials’ attitudes, knowledge and relationship towards the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in their cities through topical expert interviews. Our interviewees came from two metropolitan area cities, Helsinki and Espoo, which have taken an active role in attempting to utilize various novel technologies. Through these interviews, we identify and discuss key issues in the infusion of AI into cities. These interviewees were key players in their respective cities’ response to the challenge and opportunity of novel technologies, including AI. As such, while our sampling is small, these interviewees are a good representation of the relevant individuals who hold sway over the thoughts, visions, ideas and challenges that are recognized in their respective organizations. We ask, how do these individuals understand AI and gauged through their views, how are these cities prepared for the increasing and continuous infusion of artificial intelligence technologies in these cities’ agendas, practices and projects?","Luusua, Aale and Ylipulli, Johanna","urban computing, artificial intelligence, city strategy, Cities, urban data, city officials, interview",10.1145/3461564.3461571,2021,10
article,"Artificial Intelligence, Artists, and Art: Attitudes Toward Artwork Produced by Humans vs. Artificial Intelligence","This study examines how people perceive artwork created by artificial intelligence (AI) and how presumed knowledge of an artist's identity (Human vs. AI) affects individuals’ evaluation of art. Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.","Hong, Joo-Wha and Curran, Nathaniel Ming","human-machine communication, human-computer interaction, schema theory, CASA, creativity, Artificial intelligence, art",10.1145/3326337,2019,16
inproceedings,Regulating Artificial Intelligence: Proposal for a Global Solution,"Given the ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern societies, it is clear that individuals, corporations, and countries will be grappling with the legal and ethical issues of its use. As global problems require global solutions, we propose the establishment of an international AI regulatory agency that --- drawing on interdisciplinary expertise --- could create a unified framework for the regulation of AI technologies and inform the development of AI policies around the world. We urge that such an organization be developed with all deliberate haste, as issues such as cryptocurrencies, personalized political ad hacking, autonomous vehicles and autonomous weaponized agents are already a reality, affecting international trade, politics, and war.","Erd\'{e}lyi, Olivia J. and Goldsmith, Judy","transnational legal ordering, international governance, hard/soft law, international organizations",10.1145/3278721.3278731,2018,7

inproceedings,Facilitating Computing Students' Transition to Higher Education,"Students who progress to higher education from further education colleges are faced with academic, social, and logistical challenges during their transition. In general, they find university life more challenging compared to students who have been at university for two years already. The Associate Student Project (ASP) is an intervention programme within the School of Computing that provides support to students who make this transition. This support includes access to online resources, orientation events, university lectures and workshops, throughout their two years at further education college. This study aims to measure the impact of the ASP through a survey on academic behavioural confidence and a comparison of the grade point average of three student groups: independent direct entrants (n=53), associate students (n=27), and native students (students who entered university at first year, n=75). Analysis revealed that, while independent direct entrants (IDE) were less confident about their studies than native students (NS), there was a closer parity of confidence between native and associate students (AS). In addition, AS' confidence on tasks that relate to requesting information is higher than the other groups, perhaps due to the ASP's emphasis on providing good information to AS and encouraging dialogue. Associate students found interventions that provide insight into university life prior to their transfer useful. Additionally, the grade point average of AS was not found to be significantly different in comparison to native students. This paper reports on the success of these interventions in building student confidence and explores the impact for transitional students.","Fabian, Khristin and Taylor-Smith, Ella and Meharg, Debbie and Varey, Alison","widening participation, student transitions, higher education, further education, direct entrants",10.1145/3351287.3351298,2019,7
inproceedings,Familiarizing Children with Artificial Intelligence,"Recently, children's Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy has gained interest due to AI penetrating our daily lives more widely. This paper illustrates findings from an empirical study with the purpose of familiarizing two classes of 11-12-year-old children (N=37) with central concepts related to AI, using existing material with modifications. During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.","Khalid, Kashifa and Iivari, Netta and Kinnula, Marianne and Sharma, Sumita",No data,10.1145/3569219.3569390,2022,5
inproceedings,A is for Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Activities on Young Children's Perceptions of Robots,"We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.","Williams, Randi and Park, Hae Won and Breazeal, Cynthia","child-robot interaction, ai education, social robots, early childhood education",10.1145/3290605.3300677,2019,11

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence for Conversational Robo-Advisor,"With the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, the combination of AI with financial technology (FinTech) has become a development trend in the financial industry. However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor.","Day, Min-Yuh and Lin, Jian-Ting and Chen, Yuan-Chih","deep learning, financial technology (FinTech), artificial intelligence (AI), robo-advisor, conversational commerce",No data,2020,8

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Risk in Design,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are more and more integrated into everyday lives, both scholarly and popular discourses on AI's often revolve around charting the various risks that may be associated with them. The manner and magnitude of risk that various researchers identify and foresee varies; however, what is common between them is, undoubtedly, the concept of risk itself. This concept, we argue, has been largely taken for granted by the fields involved in the research on AI's; in other words, ""risk"" has been employed with an everyday sensibility without due critical examination. In this paper, we address risk as a concept directly, by examining interdisciplinary theories and literatures on risk to discuss examples of AI technologies. Through this work, we aim to begin a critical discussion of the importance of theorising risk within design research and practice, and within the development of emerging technologies.","Luusua, Aale and Ylipulli, Johanna","urban ai, general ai, objective risk, artificial intelligence, risk, theory, experience, subjective risk, narrow ai",10.1145/3357236.3395491,2020,10

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Empowered Domain Modelling Bot,"With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.","Saini, Rijul","natural language processing (NLP), bot, machine learning (ML), natural language (NL), domain model, artificial intelligence (AI)",10.1145/3417990.3419486,2020,6

Feelings were analyzed using techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and through the computer programs MATLAB and NVIVO applied to the 500 phrases, obtained from 55 interviews with an average of 47 words per phrase. When carrying out the sentiment analysis, it was obtained that approximately 64% was negative, 11% neutral and 25% positive. LDA found that the 55 interviews were explained by 2 unobserved groups represented by the word clouds of topics 7 and 14. The unobserved groups show feelings such as stress, tiredness, problems and effort that may be related to the words people, evaluation, type, education and strength. This research can be complemented with a study that allows to deepen the type of negative, neutral and positive feelings and to determine their possible causes.","Pazmi\~{n}o, Rub\'{e}n and Badillo, Fernando and Gonz\'{a}lez, Miguel Conde and Garc\'{\i}a-Pe\~{n}alvo, Francisco Jos\'{e}","higher education, NVIVO, MATLAB, COVID-19, Ecuador, Sentiment analysis",10.1145/3434780.3436679,2021,7
inproceedings,Do People Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A Cross-Topic Multicultural Study,"In the era of 4.0 industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are the undisputed protagonists on a world-wide stage. In the last decade, expert and learning systems have been widely applied to a plethora of tasks that were considered, in the past, as solvable only by a human. And on top of that, machines are becoming more reliable and accurate than human experts.However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it. In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains.","Kolasinska, Agnieszka and Lauriola, Ivano and Quadrio, Giacomo","human perception, machine learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3342428.3342667,2019,6

inproceedings,Research of Artificial Intelligence Computer Vision Application,"With the continuous development of Internet technology, Internet users are no longer satisfied with obtaining information only through text. More and more users like to take photos or screenshots through smart phones to save and share their life information. Subsequently, using computer to recognize and process image information becomes more and more important. Image recognition technology is an important research field of artificial intelligence. This technology can enable computers to process a large amount of information instead of human beings, so as to free human beings from cumbersome workload. Image recognition technology [3-5] meets the relevant needs of actual users through the steps of relevant information acquisition, preprocessing and model training. Image recognition technology first defines the characteristics of related objects, then memory image matching, and finally image recognition. For the definition of the features of related objects, we can not only use the predefined features, but also train the related features through convolutional neural network.","Xu, Gaofeng","artificial intelligence, data modeling, image recognition",10.1145/3501409.3501700,2022,5

article,Explainable Artificial Intelligence-Based Competitive Factor Identification,"Competitor analysis is an essential component of corporate strategy, providing both offensive and defensive strategic contexts to identify opportunities and threats. The rapid development of social media has recently led to several methodologies and frameworks facilitating competitor analysis through online reviews. Existing studies only focused on detecting comparative sentences in review comments or utilized low-performance models. However, this study proposes a novel approach to identifying the competitive factors using a recent explainable artificial intelligence approach at the comprehensive product feature level. We establish a model to classify the review comments for each corresponding product and evaluate the relevance of each keyword in such comments during the classification process. We then extract and prioritize the keywords and determine their competitiveness based on relevance.

inproceedings,Better Metrics for Evaluating Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"This paper presents objective metrics for how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be quantified. Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.","Rosenfeld, Avi","system evaluation, explainable artificial intelligence, interpretable machine learning, human-agent systems",No data,2021,6

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Learning Skills Assessment: A Pedagogical Innovation,"Competency-based learning assessment has recently undergone an important development in the field of education. Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student. In fact, it allows a judicious evaluation which follows the enormous progress by adopting an automated method which takes into account the competence level of each pupil.","Diyer, Okacha and Achtaich, Naceur and Najib, Khalid","Learning skills, digital assistance systems, artificial intelligence, innovative learning, learning assessments",10.1145/3386723.3387901,2020,5
inproceedings,Artificial Concepts of Artificial Intelligence: Institutional Compliance and Resistance in AI Startups,"Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI"" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.","Winecoff, Amy A. and Watkins, Elizabeth Anne","organizational theory, artificial intelligence, ethical systems, industry practice, qualitative methods",10.1145/3514094.3534138,2022,12

inproceedings,Graduates' Prediction System Using Artificial Intelligence,"Graduation rates are an essential metric for universities to gauge the effectiveness of their programmes. Prediction models can be used to assess students' likelihood of completing their degrees, as well as to analyse the rate of completion of programmes that they offer.Several studies have been done previously using predictive models in various universities around the world. At King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB), Prachuabsupakij and Wuttikamolchai developed a web application that used the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict student's graduation. Other studies made use of other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, neural network and classification and regression tree algorithms. These studies achieved a successful prediction rate of an average of above 70% accuracy.The University of Namibia does not have any predictive models of any kind and neither has any study of this nature ever been done. It was for this reason that this study was conducted using the School of Computing as the case study. The study would then develop a graduates' prediction system for the school of computing.The system is a web-based application that requires a user to log in before accessing its features, such as displaying the predicted outcomes. A sample of 500 student data was used to create the student dataset. The prediction was done using four different prediction models which were then comparatively analysed. Those prediction models are Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest.The web-based application consists of an interactive dashboard to allow the user to visualize the prediction results which can be view using different types of charts all to the user's convenience.This study managed to attain its main object of creating a student graduation prediction system for the school of computing and the sub-objective were also met. The predictions of this study were purely based on the students' academic results in the form of credit scores and other factors were not considered. This study recommends that further research should be done with actual student data from the university's student database records that stretches for over a longer period, say about 5 to 10 years.","Suresh, Nalina and Hashiyana, Valerianus and Nhinda, Gabriel Tuhafeni and Stephanus, Ismael and Kautwima, Paulus","UNAM, Graduation, Predictions, School of Computing",10.1145/3484824.3484873,2022,11

inproceedings,Should Artificial Intelligence Governance Be Centralised? Design Lessons from History,"Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply inadequate.","Cihon, Peter and Maas, Matthijs M. and Kemp, Luke","centralization, institutional design, governance fragmentation, global governance, artificial intelligence policy, regime complex",10.1145/3375627.3375857,2020,7
inproceedings,Automated Condition Monitoring Using Artificial Intelligence,"Machine maintenance is a major part of total operating costs for manufacturing and production plants, hence, having a cost-effective maintenance strategy is key to success. Most standard solutions operate on a time-driven approach where repairs or replacements are carried out after a given amount of time. This results in healthy machines being replaced unnecessarily incurring losses in both time, resource, and parts. Predictive maintenance utilises sensors capable of collecting real-time operating data and analytical techniques to predict when a machine will require maintenance. This research develops a vibration analysis tool that can detect and differentiate a machines operating conditions without any human analysis or intervention demonstrated via a case study. By using spectrograms in conjunction with image recognition and unsupervised learning, the tool is capable of being applied to many different machines without modification. Results show that features extracted using convolutional auto-encoding and t-SNE, are capable of being clustered in an unsupervised manner accurately based on case study test conditions.

Since then, the evolution of human civilization has been initiated, with curiosity driving science and the desire for control driving technology. The development of science and technology has unfolded in two dimensions of outward and inward, the outward from the solar system, the galaxy to the universe; the inward pointing to human itself, from the movement of life to the movement of consciousness, giving rise to artificial intelligence (AI). For the first time, the ""human-like"" nature of AI has shaken the social activity in which the world is the stage and humans are the main actors, leading to the ethical issues of AI, of course, including the ethical issues of AI in education(AIEd). The ethical issue of AIEd is the problem caused by the transformation of the actors by implanting humanoids into the human educational community. The main issues include the ethical problem of AI, the adaption of new human and new norms of human behaviors, and the stage for the activities of the actors—the field of AIEd.

In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for AI in India. We detail opportunities that are cross-cutting (bridging India's linguistic divisions, mining public data), and also specific to one particular sector (healthcare). We list challenges that originate from existing social conditions (such as equations of caste and gender).

inproceedings,Estimating Student Dropout in Distance Higher Education Using Semi-Supervised Techniques,"Nowadays, distance higher education has rapidly increased due to advance and integration of information and communications' technology. Students who attend online distance courses have often family obligations and job commitments and are usually in 'high risk' of dropout during their attendance. It is of a highly importance to identify such students, through paying extra attention and support to them could possibly minimize the possibility of student failure or even dropout. The present research intends to study whether semi-supervised techniques could be useful in student dropout prediction in distance higher education. Semi-supervised learning aims to generate reliable predictions using few labeled and many unlabeled data. Labeled data are difficult obtainable quite often, as they require many experts, a lot of human effort and time in experiments. As far as, we are aware in several studies propose and compare supervised methods for students' dropout prediction rates in higher education, but none of them investigates the effectiveness of semi-supervised methods. The results of our experiments reveal that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved using few labeled data in comparison to well known supervised learning algorithms. For that purpose we have developed a web-based tool to estimate if an individual student is going to dropout.","Kostopoulos, Georgios and Kotsiantis, Sotiris and Pintelas, Panagiotis","distance higher education, tri-training algorithm, semi-supervised learning, C4.5 decision tree, dropout",10.1145/2801948.2802013,2015,6
inproceedings,Learning Analytics as a Core Component for Higher Education Disruption: Governance Stakeholder,"Higher education institutions are at this stage, on the one hand, faced with challenges never seen before and, on the other hand, their action is moving very rapidly into digital learning spaces. These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics? As a response to the question raised in this paper is presented an extension of a disruptive conceptual approach to higher education, using information gathered by IoT and based on Big Data &amp; Cloud Computing and Learning Analytics analysis tools, with the main focus on the stakeholder governance.","Moreira, Fernando and Gon\c{c}alves, Ramiro and Martins, Jos\'{e} and Branco, Frederico and Au-Yong-Oliveira, Manuel","Learning Analytics, Governance, Disruption, Higher Education Institutions",10.1145/3144826.3145387,2017,8

inproceedings,Opportunities and Challenges in Using AI Chatbots in Higher Education,"Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational chatbots have gained popularity over time, and have been widely used in the fields of e-commerce, online banking, and digital healthcare and well-being, among others. The technology has the potential to provide personalised service to a range of consumers. However, the use of chatbots within educational settings is still limited. In this paper, we present three chatbot prototypes, the Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, are currently developing, and discuss the potential opportunities and technical challenges we face when considering AI chatbots to support our daily activities within the department. Three AI virtual agents are under development: 1) to support the delivery of a taught Master's course simulation game; 2) to support the training and use of a newly introduced educational application; 3) to improve the processing of helpdesk requests within a university department. We hope this paper is informative to those interested in using chatbots in the educational domain. We also aim to improve awareness among those within the chatbot development industry, in particular the chatbot engine providers, about the educational and operational needs within educational institutes, which may differ from those in other domains.","Yang, Shanshan and Evans, Chris","AI in helpdesk support, AI in application training, intelligent systems, AI in educational simulation, AI in education, Chatbot, personalised educational service",10.1145/3371647.3371659,2020,5
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and the Automatic Classification of Historical Photographs,"The amount of historical photographs is a challenge for archives with regard to analyzing, documenting and structuring archival material and make it retrievable and accessible. Established human centric concepts will not be able to handle the instream of un- or semi-structured material or handle analogue documentation. We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study. For this an artificial neural network / convolutional neural network was trained and tested on a collection of historical photographs.","Eiler, Florian and Graf, Simon and Dorner, Wolfgang","image classification, Artificial intelligence, Tensorflow",10.1145/3284179.3284324,2018,5

inproceedings,Conceptual Challenges of Researching Artificial Intelligence in Public Administrations,"Research has been advancing on the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administrations. However, there is limited consensus and agreement on what is considered Artificial Intelligence, as different understandings and approaches in research and practice exist. This paper explores and compares the varying ways AI has been described and understood in previous Information Systems and eGovernment research. Following, a survey amongst Belgium civil servants is analysed to assess what they associate with the term Artificial Intelligence. The findings show that many civil servants tend to associate AI with being able to conduct intelligent tasks, have certain capabilities or are specific applications they are familiar with. Specific algorithms or learning methods, often included in research papers, are not associated with the term AI. These results show that researchers and policymakers may have opposite or even paradoxical views on what is or is not AI, which could have significant consequences for researching the adoption of AI in government, as well as comparing different research findings. In this respect, the paper proposes to use an integrative lens to study AI in government, by including different dimensions and understandings.","van Noordt, Colin","Public administration, Perceptions, Civil Servants, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3543434.3543441,2022,8

inproceedings,News from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Less,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.","Longoni, Chiara and Fradkin, Andrey and Cian, Luca and Pennycook, Gordon","generative artificial intelligence, news, algorithmic transparency, fairness, news generation",10.1145/3531146.3533077,2022,10

A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.","Svenningsson, Nina and Faraon, Montathar","chatbot, AI, humanness, user experience, design guideline, conversation, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3375959.3375973,2020,11

There seems to be a similarly seductive allure for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, leading people to ""overtrust"" these systems, even when they have just witnessed the system perform poorly. The AI-powered neurotechnologies that have begun to proliferate in recent years, particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), represent a potentially doubly-alluring combination. While there is enormous potential benefit in applying AI techniques in neuroscience to ""decode"" brain activity and associated mental states, these efforts are still in the early stages, and there is a danger in using these unproven technologies prematurely, especially in important, real-world contexts. Yet, such premature use has begun to emerge in several high-stakes set-tings, including the law, health &amp; wellness, employment, and transportation. In light of the potential seductive allure of these technologies, we need to be vigilant in monitoring their scientific validity and challenging both unsubstantiated claims and misuse, while still actively supporting their continued development and proper use.","Giattino, Charles M. and Kwong, Lydia and Rafetto, Chad and Farahany, Nita A.","decoding, overtrust, EEG, neurotechnology",10.1145/3306618.3314269,2019,6

Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis.

inproceedings,Teachers’ Perspective on Artificial Intelligence Education: An Initial Investigation,"Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.","Polak, Sara and Schiavo, Gianluca and Zancanaro, Massimo","AI Education, Digital Competencies, Computing education",10.1145/3491101.3519866,2022,7

inproceedings,Training Path of College Tennis Talents Based on Artificial Intelligence,"Tennis is a unique and beautiful sport. In recent years, tennis has become more and more enthusiastic around the world, and some tennis academies have sprung up like bamboo shoots. With the gradual improvement of the tennis atmosphere, the tennis crowd has gradually increased, but at this time there is a lack of a comprehensive tennis training base and a scientific and systematic talent training model to promote the development of Chinese tennis in the future. And it happens to be a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this article studies and discusses the training path of tennis talents in colleges and universities based on artificial intelligence. Through an in-depth analysis of the training path of our country's tennis competitive talents, the current stage of our country's tennis talent training mainly relies on the following three methods: sports team training model; club training model; government, enterprise, and family joint training model. Through the introduction of artificial intelligence-related technologies, experiments on these three methods are conducted in the artificial intelligence environment. The results show that, compared with ordinary tennis talent training models, the physical and humanistic qualities of college tennis talents get 30%. The improvement of the service period and technical level of college tennis competitive talents has also reached 10% compared with the traditional training path. This shows that in the current global environment, combining the training path of tennis competitive talents in colleges and universities with the emerging artificial intelligence technology, the effect is very significant, and it is the development trend of future tennis competitive talent training.","Lv, Lili and Xu, Yijun",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495290,2022,5

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Perspectives: Protecting and Empowering Intelligent Human Beings,"As 'control' is increasingly ceded to AI systems, potentially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) humanity may be facing an identity crisis sooner rather than later, whereby the notion of 'intelligence' no longer remains solely our own. This paper characterizes the problem in terms of an impending loss of control and proposes a relational shift in our attitude towards AI. The shortcomings of value alignment as a solution to the problem are outlined which necessitate an extension of these principles. One such approach is considering strongly relational Indigenous epistemologies. The value of Indigenous perspectives has not been canvassed widely in the literature. Their utility becomes clear when considering the existence of well-developed epistemologies adept at accounting for the non-human, a task that defies Western anthropocentrism. Accommodating AI by considering it as part of our network is a step towards building a symbiotic relationship. Given that AGI questions our fundamental notions of what it means to have human rights, it is argued that in order to co-exist, we find assistance in Indigenous traditions such as the Hawaiian and Lakota ontologies.

Explainable AI (XAI) aims at making state of the art opaque models more transparent, and defends AI-based outcomes endorsed with a rationale explanation, i.e., an explanation that has as target the non-technical users. XAI and Responsible AI principles defend the fact that the audience expertise should be included in the evaluation of explainable AI systems. However, AI has not yet reached all public and audiences, some of which may need it the most. One example of domain where accessibility has not much been influenced by the latest AI advances is cultural heritage. We propose including minorities as special user and evaluator of the latest XAI techniques. In order to define catalytic scenarios for collaboration and improved user experience, we pose some challenges and research questions yet to address by the latest AI models likely to be involved in such synergy.","D\'{\i}az-Rodr\'{\i}guez, Natalia and Pisoni, Galena","computer vision, image captioning, cultural heritage, art, explainable artificial intelligence, generative models, natural language processing, deep learning, deep neural networks",10.1145/3386392.3399276,2020,8
inproceedings,Designing Adaptive Argumentation Learning Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence,"Argumentation skills are an omnipresent foundation of our daily communication and thinking. However, the learning of argumentation skills is limited due to the lack of individual learning conditions for students. Within this dissertation, I aim to explore the potential of adaptive argumentation skill learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) by designing, implementing, and evaluating new technology-enhanced pedagogical concepts to actively support students in developing the ability to argue in a structured, logical, and reflective way. I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.","Wambsganss, Thiemo","Argumentation Learning, Adaptive Skill Learning, Argumentation Mining, Pedagogical Conversational Agents",10.1145/3411763.3443422,2021,5

article,Trailblazing the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity Discipline: A Multi-Disciplinary Research Roadmap,"Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

inproceedings,Learning Analytics in Higher Education: The Student Expectations of Learning Analytics,"The report's purpose is to discover whether individual differences are connected with student expectations for learning analytics. The aim was to evaluate if the Big Five personality traits are connected to student predictions about learning analytics. Learning analytics is well-positioned to greatly improve student learning. There are many unanswered questions that are intertwined in that belief, which deals with learning analytics as a whole. Students' learning processes can be better supported and understood by using learning analytics. The goal of this investigation is to examine students' ideas about learning analytics tools' attributes and their interest in applying these features for education. In a first-stage investigation, researchers interviewed 364 university students. Smart PLS was used to carry out data analysis. Research that involves exploratory research will benefit from using partial least squares (PLS). The equal engagement of all stakeholders, from external organisations to individual students, is a challenge faced by each university given the global interest in learning analytics. Student expectations of learning analytics elements were discovered, and students are looking for support with planning and organising their learning processes, tools for self-assessment, delivery of adaptive recommendations, and personal evaluations of their learning.","Abdul Jalil, Nasir and Wong Ei Leen, Mikkay","Learning analytics, Higher Education, Educational Technology",10.1145/3502434.3502463,2022,6
inproceedings,"Formalizing Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Prerequisites, Causes and Goals of Human Trust in AI","Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.","Jacovi, Alon and Marasovi\'{c}, Ana and Miller, Tim and Goldberg, Yoav","distrust, contractual trust, trustworthy, artificial intelligence, sociology, warranted trust, trust, formalization",10.1145/3442188.3445923,2021,12

inproceedings,A Comparative Study of Programming Competencies in Vocational Training and Higher Education,"Technical progress and social transformation processes require lifelong learning in different spaces and formats. This leads to new developments and challenges in education with regard to competency-based learning and recognition practices, especially as educational biographies become increasingly diverse and extensive repetitions of qualifications should be avoided. Until recently, a common assessment strategy for previously developed competencies has not been established in higher education. In this study, competencies expected in German vocational and higher educational programming training were identified, compared and evaluated with regard to equivalence. The methodological approach started with an extensive review of general frameworks and curricula, before competency descriptions and analyses of reference documents of German vocational and university programming education were gathered and systematically compared. As part of the iterative design process, a comparison matrix was developed, and common features along with gaps and overlaps of competencies were identified. Even though both educational tracks pursue different goals, they share a great number of expected programming competencies. In the context of lifelong learning, the proposed process can be utilized for improving the permeability and recognition practises in both vocational training and higher education.","Kiesler, Natalie and Thorbr\""{u}gge, Carsten","competency, comparison, programming education, vocational training, educational system analysis, recognition, higher education",10.1145/3502718.3524818,2022,7
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Organizational Memory in Government: The Experience of Record Duplication in the Child Welfare Sector in Canada,"In recent years, the topic of artificial intelligence in government has become a major area of study. Governments have been eager to adopt artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including for the prediction of risk in social services. Child protection services are exploring predictive analytics for the initial screening of cases. While research identifies data quality issues as a major barrier, little is known about the characteristics of these issues in child protection, their relationship to organizational memory contained in administrative data, and their impact on the ability of an organization to adopt these technologies. This study gained insight into the socio-technical limitations of duplicate records when trying to bring organizational memory to bear in predictive decision support by interviewing and observing staff use of information technology systems. The study's findings suggest that record duplication in case management systems in child protection could pose a significant challenge to the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies such as predictive analytics for decision assistance. There is a need to address foundational information management and system issues before artificial intelligence approaches such as this can be introduced in the child protection sector.","M.

article,Exploitation for Multimedia Asian Information Processing and Artificial Intelligence-Based Art Design and Teaching in Colleges,"Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and learning due to its quick progress. &nbsp;Any creation made with the help of artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Meets Kinesthetic Intelligence: Mouse-Based User Authentication Based on Hybrid Human-Machine Learning,"Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.","Fu, Shen and Qin, Dong and Amariucai, George and Qiao, Daji and Guan, Yong and Smiley, Ann","behavioral biometrics, mouse-based user authentication, kinesthetic intelligence, induced expertise",10.1145/3488932.3523257,2022,15

It is proposed that relevant design factors should be fully considered when designing the intelligent system of college gymnasiums, so as to realize the goals of advanced technology, maturity, reasonable economy, practical functions, safety and reliability, and sustainable development. The college gymnasium is an important support point for the development of college sports teaching innovation. Its AI system has strong professionalism. In the early stage of its planning and design, the entire gymnasium needs to be accurately positioned in conjunction with the corresponding sports items, and the gymnasium accepts the main personnel are the starting point, and the relevant information system layout is guided by the difference of different spatial information needs, which fully reflects the ""people-oriented"" principle. The experimental results show that the scores of students in the experimental group are mostly 85 points and above, while the results of students in the control group are concentrated in the range of 65 to 85. The practical ability of PD students under the AI gymnasium has improved significantly. Students are explaining and organizing actions. There is a good learning ability in teaching activities.","Lou, Zhen",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483082,2021,5
inproceedings,Data Analytics and Visualization to Support the Adult Learner in Higher Education,"Data analytics can be used by higher education to have a deeper understanding of the learners and their learning. As the use of data analytics become more common, educators are often required not only to make sense of the analytics, but also make meaning pedagogically to better support the learner and the learning. This paper discusses the conceptualization and implementation of targeted learner support and intervention with the use of learning analytics and data visualization for the adult learner in higher education. The key objective is to leverage on learners’ metrics in a format with visual indicators that give an overview of various aspects of the learning so that higher education institutions can profile their adult learners and anticipate their needs with customized advisories and intervention approaches. The learner metrics is presented in two different dashboards, applying both descriptive and predictive analytics, to provide deeper insights.","Chong, Sylvia and Lee, Yew Haur and Tang, Yoke Wah","adult learners, data visualization, Learning analytics",10.1145/3421682.3421698,2020,6
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in the Construction of an Adaptive Pedagogical Model for Mathematics Leveling,"There is an enormous disadvantage for students who, due to different situations, have decided to return to higher education after a prolonged period of time, in the face of an educational system designed for optimal conditions for students. The disadvantage deepens when already in their adult stage, the time for academic dedication decreases due to their work occupations. This proposal aims to adapt the pedagogical model to their needs, specific needs in logic and mathematical operability, time, mobility, and location. Achieving this requires the design of a hybrid application based primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to achieve the adaptation to the student through the correct training of neural networks, resulting in the identification of the specific requirements of each user and the selection and application of strategies, teaching techniques and content of the mathematics program to be learned and apprehended by the person who must remedy the shortcomings caused by the cessation and in many cases by a poor academic process. The following is a tour through the different aspects that support the proposal; from the need presented by students with academic cessation to the approach of a technological and specific solution for each individual starting from the generality of the causes to the possibility of giving a unique result thanks to the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.","Mart\'{\i}nez, Efra\'{\i}n and Queiruga-Dios, Araceli and Rasteiro, Deolinda","Machine Learning, Apps, Mathematics, neural networks, Artificial intelligence, Academic Assignments, pedagogical model",10.1145/3486011.3486551,2021,5
inproceedings,Analyzing Cyber-Physical Systems from the Perspective of Artificial Intelligence,"Principles of modern cyber-physical system (CPS) analysis are based on analytical methods that depend on whether safety or liveness requirements are considered. Complexity is abstracted through different techniques, ranging from stochastic modelling to contracts. However, both distributed heuristics and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches as well as the user perspective or unpredictable effects, such as accidents or the weather, introduce enough uncertainty to warrant reinforcement-learning-based approaches. This paper compares traditional approaches in the domain of CPS modelling and analysis with the AI researcher perspective to exploring unknown complex systems.","Veith, Eric MSP and Fischer, Lars and Tr\""{o}schel, Martin and Nie\ss{}e, Astrid","Neural Network Control, Multi-Agent Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Cyber-Physical Systems security, Cyber-Physical Systems",10.1145/3388218.3388222,2020,11
inproceedings,"Implications of AI (Un-)Fairness in Higher Education Admissions: The Effects of Perceived AI (Un-)Fairness on Exit, Voice and Organizational Reputation","Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.","Marcinkowski, Frank and Kieslich, Kimon and Starke, Christopher and L\""{u}nich, Marco","higher education systems, reputation, exit, procedural fairness, voice, algorithmic decision making, distributive fairness, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3351095.3372867,2020,9

inproceedings,Understanding How People Reason about Aesthetic Evaluations of Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making remarkable achievements even in creative fields such as aesthetics. However, whether those outside the machine learning (ML) community can sufficiently interpret or agree with their results, especially in such highly subjective domains, is being questioned. In this paper, we try to understand how different user communities reason about AI algorithm results in subjective domains. We designed AI Mirror, a research probe that tells users the algorithmically predicted aesthetic scores of photographs. We conducted a user study of the system with 18 participants from three different groups: AI/ML experts, domain experts (photographers), and general public members. They performed tasks consisting of taking photos and reasoning about AI Mirror's prediction algorithm with think-aloud sessions, surveys, and interviews. The results showed the following: (1) Users understood the AI using their own group-specific expertise; (2) Users employed various strategies to close the gap between their judgments and AI predictions overtime; (3) The difference between users' thoughts and AI pre-dictions was negatively related with users' perceptions of the AI's interpretability and reasonability. We also discuss design considerations for AI-infused systems in subjective domains.","Oh, Changhoon and Kim, Seonghyeon and Choi, Jinhan and Eun, Jinsu and Kim, Soomin and Kim, Juho and Lee, Joonhwan and Suh, Bongwon","neural image assessment, aesthetic evaluation, ai in subjective fields, algorithmic experience, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3357236.3395430,2020,13

For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.","Speith, Timo","explainable artificial intelligence, XAI, interpretability, taxonomy, transparency, review, explainability",10.1145/3531146.3534639,2022,12

inproceedings,Investigating Soft Skills Development at a Higher Education Institution in South Africa,"There seems to be a gap between what industry expect from employees on the one hand, and the soft skills of recent graduates from Higher Education Institutions on the other. The aim of this paper was to investigate if the perceptions of IT-students regarding their own soft skills have changed over a period of 3 years. To do this a questionnaire was distributed in 2019 to the same students who completed this questionnaire in 2016, and the results were analysed. The results of this study showed that although soft skills should increase from student's first year of study to their final year, this is not how the students perceive the development of their own soft skills. The biggest improvements were in the students' perceptions of their skills in cross-cultural relationships, work ethic, decision-making and critical thinking. The skills for client management, time management, professionalism and leadership were perceived as lower. The results confirmed that the IT-students' own perceptions are not a reliable way of measuring their soft skills. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of factors for further study, and according to this results the important soft skills were: Communication; Conflict management; Critical thinking; Interpersonal relations and teamwork; Leadership and Emotional intelligence; Multidisciplinary thinking; Professionalism and work ethic; and Self-management. These can now be used in further research on soft skills.","Taylor, Estelle","Soft skills, industry, higher education, information technology",10.1145/3371647.3371669,2020,7

inproceedings,Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Human Embryo Cell Cleavage Stages Analysis,"Many couples struggle with infertility, and opt for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Selecting the embryo with the highest chance of resulting in pregnancy, is one of the most critical steps of the ART procedure. The implantation potential of an embryo is associated with its morphology which includes assessing cell cleavage stages. Today, the assessment is mainly done manually by visual examination by embryologist and therefore is often subjective. Deep learning (DL) models can be used to automatically classify cell cleavage stages, and make the embryo assessment process efficient, objective. However, it is important that embryologists understand and trust the DL predictions, and in this paper we evaluate the potential of three explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. First, we compare the two XAI techniques Grad-CAM and LIME to identify important characteristics in embryo images associated with specific embryo cleavage stages. Both approaches identified biologically relevant morphological characteristics, but generally Grad-CAM was more consistent than LIME. Secondly, we suggest an approach on how to use the XAI technique SHAP to identify image characteristics that caused some images to be misclassified. The identified image characteristics had meaningful biological interpretation such as fragmentation. Overall the study demonstrates that DL in combination XAI can be useful in embryo assessment and selection.","Sharma, Akriti and Stensen, Mette H. and Delbarre, Erwan and Haugen, Trine B. and Hammer, Hugo L.","embryo cell cleavage stage, embryo morphology assessment, assisted reproduction technology, deep learning, explainable AI",10.1145/3512731.3534206,2022,8
inproceedings,Criminological Risks and Legal Aspects of Artificial Intelligence Implementation,"The use of AI inevitably leads to the problem of ethical choice, raises legal issues that require prompt intervention. The article presents the results of a detailed study of the opinions of leading scientists involved in the study of social aspects of AI. The key characteristics of AI that carry criminological risks are identified, the types of criminological risks of using AI are identified, the author's classification of these risks is proposed. The results of a detailed analysis of the legal regulation of the legal personality of AI are presented. Formulated options for bringing to justice those responsible for the actions of the AI, having the ability to self-learning, who decided to commit actions / inactions that qualify as a crime. Authors argue the need for a clear, rigorous and effective definition of ethical frameworks in the development, design, production, use and modification of AI. Arguments are made about the need to recognize AI as a source of increased danger. The paper analyzes the content of the resolution of the European Parliament on the possibility of endowing AI with ""legal status"". Special attention is paid to the question of giving the AI a personality. It is proposed to use legal fiction as a technique in which the specific legal personality of AI can be perceived as a non-standard legal position, different from reality. It is assumed that such a decision can remove a number of legal restrictions that exist today and prevent the active involvement of AI in the legal space.","Bikeev, Igor and Kabanov, Pavel and Begishev, Ildar and Khisamova, Zarina","technological singularity, robot, artificial intelligence, criminological features, european parliament resolution, the source of high risk, criminological risks, intelligent technology, threat of use of artificial intelligence, the criminal capacity of artificial intelligence, liability of artificial intelligence, crimes with the use of artificial intelligence, criminal liability, legal fiction, the risks of the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, legal personality",10.1145/3371425.3371476,2019,7

inproceedings,Theories of Parenting and Their Application to Artificial Intelligence,"As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely. These principles may encourage new thinking about the development, design, training, and release into the world of increasingly autonomous agents.","Croeser, Sky and Eckersley, Peter","artificial intelligence, parenting, machine learning, ethics",10.1145/3306618.3314231,2019,6

The combination of artificial intelligence and psychology can be widely used in various fields such as national life, agricultural production, product development, and garrison construction. This study analyzes and explores whether there is a correlation between parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability, which can provide a basis for subsequent artificial intelligence to detect emotions. This paper mainly uses offline collection of micro-expression recognition data and filling out questionnaires at the same time to collect data and conduct survey research. A total of 175 questionnaires were collected, of which 175 were valid. 110 data of micro-expression recognition were collected, of which 100 were valid. The results found that there was a significant correlation between the parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability of college students. Specifically, the rejection dimension of parents was significantly and negatively correlated with micro-expression recognition ability. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of fields, among which the combination of machine learning and expression recognition can effectively improve the possibility of screening out suspicious people in specific situations.","Duan, Yuanyuan and Shen, Xunbing","micro-expression recognition, parenting style, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3500931.3500956,2021,5

article,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Image Analysis of Bacterial Cells and Biofilms,"The current study explores an artificial intelligence framework for measuring the structural features from microscopy images of the bacterial biofilms. <italic>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</italic> G20 (DA-G20) grown on mild steel surfaces is used as a model for sulfate reducing bacteria that are implicated in microbiologically influenced corrosion problems. Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.","Ragi, Shankarachary and Rahman, Md Hafizur and Duckworth, Jamison and Jawaharraj, Kalimuthu and Chundi, Parvathi and Gadhamshetty, Venkataramana",No data,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3138304,2021,11
inproceedings,AI-Generated vs. Human Artworks. A Perception Bias Towards Artificial Intelligence?,"Via generative adversarial networks (GANs), artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced many areas, especially the artistic field, as symbol of a human task. In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.","Ragot, Martin and Martin, Nicolas and Cojean, Salom\'{e}","GAN, artificial intelligence, bias, AI, can, painting, computational creativity, authorship, arts",10.1145/3334480.3382892,2020,10

inproceedings,Redefining Teacher Qualification in the Artificial Intelligence Era: A Professional Capital Perspective,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is challenging teacher professionalism, thus how to define a teacher in the AI era has become a hot topic in education. Many studies adopted a teacher literacy perspective on redefining a teacher for artificial intelligence in education(AIEd), while ignoring the sociological observation of the challenges faced with teachers in their professional field. This paper was framed by the core concept “professional capital” from sociology, the revolutionary power in the field, analyzed the trend of education field evolving from traditional education to AIEd. Based on the analysis, the paper proposed that, teacher professional capital is the impetus that empowers teachers to reconstruct their professional identity in the AI era. Teacher professional capital for AIEd mainly manifests itself in three forms: teacher human capital(THC), representing teacher agency to teach with AI at the individual level; teacher social capital(TSC), representing the synergetic resources circulating in teachers’ social networks at the interpersonal system; teacher decisional capital(TDC), representing the collaborative decision-making power at the human-AI level. In teachers’ professional practice, THC empowers teachers the capability to transit from traditional education field to AIEd field; TSC endows teachers the power to leverage other people's professional capital to teach with AI; TDC ensures teachers professional autonomy to teach with AI in a reasonable and legal manner.","Liu, Xiaolin and Li, Yaoqing","Education Field, Pedagogy Innovation, Teacher Professional Development, Teacher Professional Capital, Artificial Intelligence in Education",10.1145/3524383.3524405,2022,5

inproceedings,Revealing MageCart-like Threats in Favicons via Artificial Intelligence,"Modern malware increasingly takes advantage of information hiding to avoid detection, spread infections, and obfuscate code. A major offensive strategy exploits steganography to conceal scripts or URLs, which can be used to steal credentials or retrieve additional payloads. A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.","Guarascio, Massimo and Zuppelli, Marco and Cassavia, Nunziato and Caviglione, Luca and Manco, Giuseppe","malware, magecart, artificial intelligence, steganography, information hiding",10.1145/3538969.3544437,2022,7

inproceedings,Using Educational Robotic Exoskeleton for the Acquisition of Cross-Curricular Competences in Higher Education,"Today, Spanish universities are already adapted to the Common European Higher Education Area, which is based on the acquisition of competences by the student. Nevertheless, while the acquisition of specific competences is well assumed by the different subjects of each degree, the same is not true for cross-curricular competences. More specifically, in most engineering studies, these competences are developed indirectly through elective subjects or other complementary training activities.

inproceedings,How Do Software Companies Deal with Artificial Intelligence Ethics? A Gap Analysis,"The public and academic discussion on Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is accelerating and the general public is becoming more aware AI ethics issues such as data privacy in these systems. To guide ethical development of AI systems, governmental and institutional actors, as well as companies, have drafted various guidelines for ethical AI. Though these guidelines are becoming increasingly common, they have been criticized for a lack of impact on industrial practice. There seems to be a gap between research and practice in the area, though its exact nature remains unknown. In this paper, we present a gap analysis of the current state of the art by comparing practices of 39 companies that work with AI systems to the seven key requirements for trustworthy AI presented in the “The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. The key finding of this paper is that there is indeed notable gap between AI ethics guidelines and practice.

inproceedings,A Corpus-Based Study of Higher Education Students’ Errors in Word Formation,"The paper aims to find out the word formation errors made by Chinese college students. A corpus-based error analysis methodology was adopted. From the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC), all word formation errors tagged as [fm2] were collected, processed and analyzed. It was found that Chinese college students mainly made four types of errors in word formation. The most common word formation errors in Chinese college students’ writings were erroneous irregular inflections and compound words. The author argues that overgeneralization and the complex processes of English word formation are the main causes of these errors. The findings are significant in helping Chinese English learners identify their errors in word formation and telling teachers what errors learners have made in word formation.","Xia, Lixin","Word formation, English learning and teaching, Error analysis, Corpus linguistics, Interlanguage",10.1145/3463531.3463546,2021,6
inproceedings,An Exploratory Diagnosis of Artificial Intelligence Risks for a Responsible Governance.,"Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.","Teixeira, S\'{o}nia and Rodrigues, Jos\'{e} and Veloso, Bruno and Gama, Jo\~{a}o","Ethical Risks, Governance, Technological Risks, Risk Perception, Diagnosis of the Situation, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3560107.3560298,2022,7
inproceedings,With a Rise in Computing Disciplines Comes a Greater Choice of Computing Degrees in Higher Education,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) internationally are increasingly recognising the importance of understanding student study choices. This is especially true in the field of computing in which skills shortages in the labour market are high but so too are student dropout rates. Loss of interest in the computing field has been reported among the reasons for students dropping out. The aim of this study is to offer a fresh perspective of the factors influencing undergraduate student’s interest and choice of specialisation in computing. Previous studies have mainly focused on five ACM-identified computing disciplines: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. With the ever-growing nature of computing, two more disciplines recently emerged: Cybersecurity and Data Science. HEIs continuously endeavour to expand computing programmes into specialist areas within these disciplines such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, robotics and creative computing. For prospective students, this maze of options can make for a difficult decision. 137 first-year computing students were invited to participate in a mixed-methods survey to explore their choices around cybersecurity and other newer specialisations. The results of the survey were matched with findings from recent literature, and show that personal interest, family, media, career prospects and prior experiences still influence student choices, with media appearing to have a greater impact compared to earlier studies. HEIs can use this when developing effective recruitment strategies in computing.","Redmond, Fiona","computing education, specialisations, disciplines, computing, student choices",10.1145/3564721.3565946,2022,11

inproceedings,Accessible PDFs: Applying Artificial Intelligence for Automated Remediation of STEM PDFs,"People with visual impairments use assistive technology, e.g., screen readers, to navigate and read PDFs. However, such screen readers need extra information about the logical structure of the PDF, such as the reading order, header levels, and mathematical formulas, described in readable form to navigate the document in a meaningful way. This logical structure can be added to a PDF with tags. Creating tags for a PDF is time-consuming, and requires awareness and expert knowledge. Hence, most PDFs are left untagged, and as a result, they are poorly readable or unreadable for people who rely on screen readers. STEM documents are particularly problematic with their complex document structure and complicated mathematical formulae. These inaccessible PDFs present a major barrier for people with visual impairments wishing to pursue studies or careers in STEM fields, who cannot easily read studies and publications from their field. The goal of this Ph.D. is to apply artificial intelligence for document analysis to reasonably automate the remediation process of PDFs and present a solution for large mathematical formulae accessibility in PDFs. With these new methods, the Ph.D. research aims to lower barriers to creating accessible scientific PDFs, by reducing the time, effort, and expertise necessary to do so, ultimately facilitating greater access to scientific documents for people with visual impairments.","Schmitt-Koopmann, Felix M. and Huang, Elaine M. and Darvishy, Alireza","Page Object Detection, Document Analysis, Tagged PDF, Math Viewer, PDF Accessibility, Accessibility, PDF/UA, Formula Recognition, Reading Order",10.1145/3517428.3550407,2022,6

inproceedings,A Pedagogical Approach in Interleaving Software Quality Concerns at an Artificial Intelligence Course,"The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks. The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases. The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.","Cernau, Laura Diana and Dio\c{s}an, Laura Silvia and undefinederban, Camelia","code quality, software engineering, software metrics",10.1145/3548660.3561332,2022,7

We focus on respecting the student's learning pace, specifically that of students with higher capabilities and/or higher performance. Hence, we propose the creation of development classrooms or labs in research groups of excellence, which will enhance learning for these groups of students. For this we require the help from the Ministry of Education. Clearly, we must make university teachers aware that these types of students have special educational needs. Further, students with high abilities are not always high-achieving students. Therefore, we must train the university teacher in the detection of these students, and in proper intervention in those cases. Finally, students with high capabilities must be made conscious of their need for a different approach: they should learn to demand their rights, for the good of all.","Gonz\'{a}lez Arrieta, Ang\'{e}lica and Garc\'{\i}a-Bermejo-Giner, Jos\'{e} R.

inproceedings,What Do Governments Plan in the Field of Artificial Intelligence? Analysing National AI Strategies Using NLP,"The primary goal of this paper is to explore how Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) can assist in reviewing, understanding, and drawing conclusions from text datasets. We explore NLP techniques for the analysis and the extraction of useful information from the text of twelve national strategies on artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, we are using a set of machine learning algorithms in order to (a) extract the most significant keywords and summarize each strategy document, (b) discover and assign topics to each document, and (c) cluster the strategies based on their pair-wise similarity. Using the results of the analysis, we discuss the findings and highlight critical issues that emerge from the national strategies for artificial intelligence, such as the importance of the data ecosystem for the development of AI, the increasing considerations about ethical and safety issues, as well as the growing ambition of many countries to lead in the AI race. Utilizing the LDA topic model, we were able to reveal the distributions of thematic sub-topics among the strategic documents. The topic modelling distributions were then used along with other document similarity measures as an input for the clustering of the strategic documents into groups. The results revealed three clusters of countries with a visible differentiation between the strategies of China and Japan on the one hand and the Scandinavian strategies (plus the German and the Luxemburgish) one on the other. The former promote technology and innovation-driven development plans in order to integrate AI with the economy, while the latter share a common view regarding the role of the public sector both as a promoter and investor but also as a user and beneficiary of AI, and give a higher priority to the ethical &amp; safety issues that are connected to the development of AI.","Papadopoulos, Theodoros and Charalabidis, Yannis","topic modelling, Automated Text Analysis, NLP, AI strategies, machine learning, document similarity",10.1145/3428502.3428514,2020,12

inproceedings,Imagining Artificial Intelligence Applications with People with Visual Disabilities Using Tactile Ideation,"There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.","Morrison, Cecily and Cutrell, Edward and Dhareshwar, Anupama and Doherty, Kevin and Thieme, Anja and Taylor, Alex","ai, design, accessibility, blind, artificial intelligence, multicultural, ideation, visually impaired",10.1145/3132525.3132530,2017,10
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Model to Predict the Virality of Press Articles,"Currently, many people share news, links, or videos, without being aware of the impact they can have on people's decisions or ways of acting. A clear example, recently experienced in Colombia, corresponds to the national strike which happened at the time of this research. Due to these unexpected circumstances, colombians experienced the influence news have on decision making that can affect the country, not only economically but politically, and socially. It showed how news can generate fear in people, or even misinform, as is the case of fake news. For these reasons, it is key to determine the relevance a story can have. Predicting the impact, will allow us to pay more attention to those news that can affect people more, avoiding misinformation and fake news. However, the problem is that there is no way of predicting the impact that a press article can have. Therefore, the aim of this work is to implement a machine learning model that allows us to predict, with the best possible accuracy, the virality of online press articles (defining virality as the amount of clicks that an article receives when it is opened). In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which focuses on machine learning projects. The best obtained result corresponds to the model where the core of the architecture was based on BERT, a pre-trained model, which, for a pair of press articles headlines, predicted whether the first headline would be more viral than the second one. On the other hand, the evaluation was carried out by comparing the amount of clicks for a pair of articles. For a practitioner point of view, digital marketers can use our results to select the best words for their online marketing campaign. For a theoretical point of view, our results present an innovative natural language processing approach based on one of the best breed of Neural network models (BERT).","L.

inproceedings,Exploring Why Underrepresented Students Are Less Likely to Study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,"There is little research on why underrepresented minorities are less likely to specifically study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). We surveyed 159 undergraduate students about their interest in, exposure to, and personal views on ML/AI in order to explore variations in responses by self-reported gender and race/ethnicity groups. We found that students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are ~6 times less likely to take a traditional ML/AI course than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity, but no significant difference was found between gender representation. Additionally, students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are more likely to report interest in social, cultural, and political impacts of ML/AI rather than the more technical aspects of ML/AI itself, which is a prevalent interest of students not underrepresented by race/ethnicity. We explore potential reasoning for this difference through further analysis of their survey responses. Encouragingly, we find that regardless of representational status 72.0% of students who report lack of interest in a traditional introductory course are interested in a ML/AI course that focuses more on the political, philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI and its impacts on society. Our findings suggest that a 'CS Principles"" style introductory ML/AI course, emphasizing social and political impacts, could be an effective way to promote diversity in ML/AI.","Barretto, Daphne and LaChance, Julienne and Burton, Emanuelle and Liao, Soohyun Nam","diversity, machine learning, underrepresented students, race and ethnicity, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3430665.3456332,2021,7
inproceedings,Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms,"Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.","Pandey, Akshat and Caliskan, Aylin","geolocation, prediction, disparate impact, AI ethics, algorithmic bias, price discrimination",10.1145/3461702.3462561,2021,12

One avenue being explored is autonomous control of the behaviour of non-player characters (NPC). This paper reviews and compares existing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for controlling the behaviour of non-human characters in Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game environments. Two techniques, the fuzzy state machine (FuSM) and the emotional behaviour tree (EBT), were reviewed and compared. In addition, an alternate and simple mechanism to incorporate emotion in a behaviour tree is proposed and tested. Initial tests of the mechanism show that it is a viable and promising mechanism for effectively tracking the emotional state of an NPC and for incorporating emotion in NPC decision making.","Waltham, Michael and Moodley, Deshen","MOBA, Artificial Intelligence, 3D Games",10.1145/2987491.2987513,2016,7

inproceedings,Modelling Mobile Signal Strength by Combining Geospatial Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,"Estimating mobile signal strength accurately is a crucial task for network providers and their customers. However, current methodologies to estimate mobile signal strength present limitations in their practical implementation (i.e. physical based models), portability (i.e. spatial interpolation methods), simplicity and accuracy (i.e. path loss models). In this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of geospatial Big Data and advanced Artificial Intelligence to predict mobile signal strength at scale. Particularly, we used open access geo-spatial information about weather, tree coverage, land use, imperviousness, altitude and network infrastructure (i.e. a total of 174 features) to train and test uncertainty-aware artificial neural networks to predict mobile signal strength on data from the NetBravo crowdsourcing platform across all the United Kingdom (UK). Our model scored a best performance of 7.9 (standard deviation of 0.2) dBm for Root Mean Squared Error and 5.7 (standard deviation of 0.4) dBm for the Mean Absolute Error. Feature importance analysis showed that mobile cell tower characteristics and geospatial features showing the distribution of imperviousness and tree cover density over the line of sight between the mobile cell tower and the receiver as well as relative humidity were among the top 20 most important features.","Fraccaro, Paolo and Benatan, Matt and Reusch, Katharina and Fare, Clyde and Edwards, Blair and Pyzer-Knapp, Edward","Mobile Signal Strength, Geospatial, Big Data, Artificial Neural Networks Learning",10.1145/3448823.3448879,2021,5

The vibration conditions are simulated and based on real-time vibration data that are acquired from a Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS). The diagnosis process passes through two main stages after the data acquisition, where then the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) method is applied to preprocess the obtained datasets (signals), and extract the features based on five statistical parameters namely: RMS, Kurtosis, Peak, Impulse Factor and Shape Factor. Then Artificial Intelligence (AI) based classification is applied using the Multilayer&nbsp;Feed-Forward&nbsp;Perceptron&nbsp;Neural Network (MLP) using different cases, where different number of neurons for the hidden layer and two different datasets of the input features with 250 features for each condition and also 2000 features for each condition once with normalized and also with non-normalized features to investigate the best cases for the performance classification in terms of neurons and features number, and also the impact of features normalization. The obtained results based on the classification performance using MLP-NN with the different cases are comparable, where the normalized features with less number of features and moderate neurons have shown better classification performance. Moreover, the results have shown the advantage of integrating CWT with the MLP-NN by providing significant classification rates for the different mechanical conditions.","Al Tobi, Maamar Ali Saud and K p, Ramachandran and Al-Araimi, Saleh and Pacturan, Rene and Rajakannu, Amuthakkannan and Achuthan, Geetha","Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN), Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)",10.1145/3560453.3560463,2022,9

inproceedings,A Novel Energy Optimization Approach for Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Massive Internet of Things,"Emerging trends in Internet of things (IoT) has caught the attention of every domain e.g., industrial, business, and healthcare etc. Sensor-embedded IoT devices are the key drivers for collecting large amount of data. Managing these large datasets is one of the critical challenges to be tackled. Continuous huge information collection through sensor-enabled devices is known as the massive IoT (mIoT). Thus, there is a need of self-adaptive artificial intelligence (AI)-based strategies to effectively cluster, examine and interpret the entire entities in the system. With increased data volumes and power hungry natured IoT devices it is a dire need to manage their power wisely. To fairly allot the power levels to the tiny portable devices it is important to integrate mIoT with AI-based techniques. To remedy these issues this paper proposes a novel cross-layer based energy optimization algorithm (CEOA) in mIoT system by examining the detailed features and data patterns. Experimental analysis reveals that proposed CEOA outperforms its competing counterpart i.e., Baseline in terms of efficient power management and monitoring.","Sodhro, Ali Hassan and Obaidat, Mohammad S. and Pirbhulal, Sandeep and Sodhro, Gul Hassan and Zahid, Noman and Rawat, Abhimanyu","performance evaluation, energy optimization, AI, CEOA, massive IoT",No data,2019,6

Therefore, it is very important to find out the factors that influence the behavior intentions of users in the artificial intelligence recommendation system and examine its effectiveness through empirical research. Taking technology acceptance theory as the research framework, and considering procedural fairness and system interpretability, this paper develops the usage intention model of artificial intelligence recommendation system, and carries out empirical research with the AMOS software. The empirical results show that the interpretability of the artificial intelligence recommendation system has a significant positive impact on user trust, usefulness, and ease of use; and procedural fairness has significant effect on trust and usefulness. The research results are helpful to further understand the impact of procedural fairness and interpretability on system usefulness and user behavior of artificial intelligence recommendation system, and offer guidance for further improvement of artificial intelligence recommendation system.","Wang, GaoShan and Liu, XiQuan and Wang, ZhongGuo and Yang, XueLan","artificial intelligence, behavioral intention, interpretability, procedural fairness, technology acceptance",10.1145/3443467.3443850,2021,5
inproceedings,Rethinking on the Teaching Method of Programming Course in Applied Universities Under Higher Education,"The teaching method is the unity of the teaching method and the learning method. In the applied college education, more emphasis is placed on the self-learning method of the students. The most direct way to respect students is to change the teaching methods of teachers so that students learn to learn and work in the process of receiving knowledge, so that they can be confident, act and be able to learn actively. Establish a student-centered learning model, with the cultivation of professional abilities as an important goal, change the role of teachers, return the stage of learning to students, let students do and study, and truly allow students to cultivate all aspects of comprehensive capabilities in the process. This article is based on the computer professional programming course ""programming language I"" as an example to rethink the teaching method. The difference between the new teaching method and the traditional teaching method is elaborated in detail from two aspects: classroom theory teaching and experimental practice teaching and the feasibility of the new teaching method are discussed from multiple angles. The new teaching method can fully arouse the enthusiasm of teachers 'teaching and students' learning, and realize deep learning of knowledge through experimental courses. At the same time, the new teaching methods have played a positive role in fostering students' learning initiative, teamwork spirit, language expression ability, problem analysis and problem solving skills. Under the new teaching method, the student group cultivated can better meet the current society's demand for talents.","Zhou, Yanling and Gu, Man and Zhang, Chi","Programming course, experimental teaching, active learning, classroom teaching, collaborative group",10.1145/3425329.3425348,2020,6

Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.","Loi, Michele and Spielkamp, Matthias","artificial intelligence, public administrations, accountability, AI guidelines",10.1145/3461702.3462631,2021,10

In particular, it has no need to deal with conflicting intuitions, and it yields a more satisfactory account of when autonomy should be respected. We begin with a ""dual standpoint'' theory of action that regards actions as grounded in reasons and therefore as having a conditional form that is suited to machine instructions. We then derive ethical principles based on formal properties that the reasons must exhibit to be coherent, and formulate the principles using quantified modal logic. We conclude that deontology not only provides a more satisfactory basis for machine ethics but endows the machine with an ability to explain its actions, thus contributing to transparency in AI.","Hooker, John N. and Kim, Tae Wan N.","modal logic, explainable ai, deontology, machine ethics, autonomous machine ethics, kantian ai, artificial intelligence ethics, accountable ai",10.1145/3278721.3278753,2018,7

inproceedings,Proposal of a Multivariate Analysis Model to Evaluate the Learning Outcomes of Students in Higher Education,"Accreditation agencies request evidence of the graduates learning outcomes during quality processes. Universities have to provide exhaustive empirical proof of their achievement and development through the academic training program, which is a significant challenge because it implies a substantial improvement and change of the educational model and evaluation method. There are still theoretical gaps to explain from an empirical perspective which elements of the university curriculum are associated with academic programs learning outcomes. The lack of empirical evidence prevents us from identifying which factors are associated with an efficient achievement of learning results in higher education institutions to implement improvement actions based on valid and objective data. In this context, learning analytics is a valuable tool that can support collecting, measuring, analyzing, and reporting data to understand the different factors involved in the educational process and their influence on learning. The primary purpose of this study is to answer how to define and validate a multivariate metamodel based on the factors involved in learning outcomes and academic performance results. In this article, we present the objectives and their phases, activities, procedures, and instruments to achieve the goal of the study. We expect to validate a metamodel on a large-scale population with different academic engineering programs at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.","Hern\'{a}ndez-Campos, M\'{o}nica and Gonzalez-Torres, Antonio and Garc\'{\i}a-Pe\~{n}alvo, Francico Jos\'{e}","learning analytics, learning factors, Learning outcomes, metamodel, accreditation",10.1145/3486011.3486536,2021,6
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Strategic Foresight – Current Practices and Future Application Potentials: Current Practices and Future Application Potentials,"The amount of data and information is growing rapidly and exponentially. A similar degree of change applies to market dynamics, volatile customer requirements, shortened product lifecycles and the amounts of environmental uncertainties in the context of organisational innovation management. Strategic Foresight (SF) offers an approach to deal with environmental uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has huge potential to support SF by means of collecting and analysing data as well as automatizing information research and analysis tasks. The current paper analyses the potentials and organisational practices at the nexus of AI and SF. In the form of expert interviews, current practices and expected future application potentials of AI in SF are analysed. Furthermore, challenges and potential weaknesses of AI in this context are discussed and an outlook on potential future visions of AI in SF from practitioners’ points of view is provided. The results show that currently AI is only applied in a very limited way to support SF, mostly in terms of supporting trend and customer data analysis. However, the results also indicate high future potentials of AI in SF. Experts agree that AI will have a high impact on SF, mainly in terms of automatizing information research and data analysis tasks and subsequently allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks in SF which require human abilities like intuition, creativity, courage and entrepreneurial thinking.t.","Brandtner, Patrick and Mates, Marius","Artificial Intelligence, Corporate Foresight, Innovation Management, Strategic Foresight, Data Analytics, Digitalization",10.1145/3481127.3481177,2021,7
inproceedings,Evaluating the Impact of Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Public Services: Towards an Assessment Framework,"Many governments are exploring applications of AI technologies to improve their public services. While AI has the potential to radically improve governmental processes, services and policy, limited studies empirically validate the effects of the use of AI. In this research paper, a first discussion on the development of a conceptual framework to research more rigorously the effects of AI in government is proposed. The proposed elements of the framework build upon the current understanding of the drivers influencing adoption of AI and takes into account the need for complementary organisational changes for increasing impact. The model follows a public value approach to understand the possible impact of AI on both the internal mechanism of the organisation, public service quality and broader societal effects.","van Noordt, Colin and Misuraca, Gianluca","public sector, public administration, framework, impact, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3428502.3428504,2020,9

inproceedings,Is the LMS Access Frequency a Sign of Students' Success in Face-to-Face Higher Education?,"Reshaping the educational system dynamics by incorporating Learning Analytics concepts along the learning cycle is a great challenge. With the progressively inclusion of online learning in Higher Education, blended learning is a reality which makes easier the inclusion of learning analysis with less human effort. This paper describes an exploratory analysis of the online activity in the official Learning Management System of 2nd-year students in a course at the Telecommunication Engineering Degree at the University of Vigo for three consecutive academic years. We conclude there is a correlation between the interaction of the students in the LMS and their final marks. Besides, we have obtained temporal behaviour patterns for successful and unsuccessful students. Thus, it is possible the early detection of students who are not interacting as they are supposed to do when following the course and, consequently, to trigger alarms for both students and professors. Besides, professors would have a good feedback system to improve the course design in short-term.","Nespereira, Celia Gonz\'{a}lez and Dai, Kais and Redondo, Rebeca P.

inproceedings,Gegelati: Lightweight Artificial Intelligence through Generic and Evolvable Tangled Program Graphs,"Tangled Program Graph (TPG) is a reinforcement learning technique based on genetic programming concepts. On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), for a fraction of their computational and storage cost. This lightness of TPGs, both for training and inference, makes them an interesting model to implement Artificial Intelligences (AIs) on embedded systems with limited computational and storage resources. In this paper, we introduce the Gegelati library for TPGs. Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chipss (MPSoCss). 2/ The support for customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end 24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoCs. The impact of customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment.","Desnos, Karol and Sourbier, Nicolas and Raumer, Pierre-Yves and Gesny, Olivier and Pelcat, Maxime",No data,10.1145/3441110.3441575,2021,9
inproceedings,Analyzing Opinions of Subscribers about Artificial Intelligence and Manpower Issues in Newspaper Coverages,"The significance of mass media is that of setting news agenda and facilitating the public opinion on the basis of this agenda setting. Thus, the role of mass media is not only an intermediary body for disseminating information to the public, but also influence on the manner, in which people consider and view society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and manpower issues are deserved to setting news agenda because the issues are critical agenda of the current era. However, the previous literatures pointed out that newspaper coverages mainly covered with the business and industrial aspect of AI issues and less attention has been given to the analysis of specific frames from public opinion. Thus, this study aims to address the opinion of subscribers about newspaper coverage on AI and manpower issues. This study employs two approaches, quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results of quantitative analysis on topic model point to three frames, namely, humanity, society, and robotics. The study then applied these frames as the basis of qualitative analysis. Subscribers are mainly concerned about a lack of humanity and the violation of human dignity due to the implementation of AI. Additionally, subscribers discussed the manner, in which AI is changing the meaning of work. In terms of robotics, opinions were clearly polarized into positive and negative: Positive points mainly viewed the benefits of robots, such as addressing the shortage in labors, eliminating heavy labor, becoming friends with human beings, among others. Conversely, the negative opinions mainly associated with the fear against robots. This study suggested that the government needs to utilize means of implementation to mitigate the user's sense of aversion against AI. Additionally, the government needs to delineate the future society toward co-existence and cooperation between machine and humans.","Nagano, Aki","Artificial Intelligence, public opinion, topic model, newspaper coverages, Manpower issues",10.1145/3560107.3560137,2022,6

In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\""{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.","Chen, Shih-Hsun and Fu, Tzu-Keng","Artificial Intelligence, Emer-gentism, Square of Opposition, Logical Hexagon, Aristotle's Logic",10.1145/3080845.3080866,2017,6

Tools for creativity are increasingly using artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report on two progressive – not comparative – autoethnographic studies to attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator.","Ghajargar, Maliheh and Bardzell, Jeffrey and Lagerkvist, Love","Storytelling, Creative writing, Artificial creativity, GPT-3, Creativity tool, AI co-creativity",10.1145/3569219.3569418,2022,12

inproceedings,Investigation and Research on the Cultivation of Students' English Interests under Artificial Intelligence Technology,"With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence, there are abundant types of learning resources and various learning methods. The use of digital resources in the context of the Internet in learning can stimulate students’ interest in English learning, improve their English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and effectively improve the efficiency of junior high school English classroom learning. Different people have different learning effects in the same learning environment because their own qualities are certainly one factor, and the more important factor is the different attitudes of the learners, that is, whether the learners are interested in learning. Interest can arouse students’ curiosity and eager thirst for knowledge, and interest can promote students’ active learning, spontaneous learning, and diligent learning more than intelligence and skills. For the English learning of junior high school students, interest is the first condition for them to learn English well. Only when students are interested in English learning, can they actively participate in English learning, and gradually become more and more interested in the specific English learning process. Through the questionnaire survey of middle school students, we can understand their tendency to attribute to English learning performance in the process of English learning. This paper aims to investigate whether middle school students are more interested in English, the higher their English scores will be, and whether male and female students are different in their interest in English. In this way, in the process of English teaching, attribution theory can be used to combine students' reality and their own experience to guide and train students in attribution so that they can form correct attributions. At the same time, this paper has a certain guiding role for workers engaged in English education for middle school students. It can help them understand the attribution tendency of middle school students in the process of English learning and give middle school students correct attribution guidance and training, thus improving teachers’ English teaching performance.","Lin, Lin",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495342,2022,6

Usually, these models are based on a number of assumptions such as the data used for the assessment, the mathematical formulation of the model and various parameters such as weights or importance indicators. Empirical evidence for such assumptions is usually lacking. We investigate the potential of using data from assessments over time and for similar institutions for the ML of respective models.

inproceedings,Establishment and Design of English Translation Memory and Terminology Database Based on Artificial Intelligence,"In the application field of professional translation and localization market, since the quality of computer translation basically meets actual needs, most of the translation products that can be sold in the market use computer-assisted translation technology. However, due to the complexity and variability of linguistic knowledge, some people have proposed translation memory, which makes full use of the powerful functions of files and databases to improve the reliability and reuse of existing translation materials. Therefore, in some professional translation technology applications with high data and repetitiveness, the use of this type of technology can effectively eliminate the double operation of translators, avoid multiple translation results of the same word or two words, and significantly improve its work efficiency. This article is based on artificial intelligence-based English translation memory and terminology establishment and design. First of all, it uses literature research to explain the functions of English translation memory technology and English translation screening methods. After analyzing the memory and terminology, according to analyzing the results of the design of the memory bank and the design library, this article locates the granularity of the memory bank at the simple sentence level, and establishes a correspondence between the various components of a sentence based on the establishment of a simple word-sentence alignment. The English sentence similarity algorithm based on syntax and semantics can well measure the structural and semantic similarity between two English sentences, and can correctly return the most similar example sentences in a memory bank. After we obtained the most similar example sentences, we translated them according to the corresponding relationship between the sentence to be translated and the various components of the most similar example sentences.","Chen, Chen",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483146,2021,5

inproceedings,Ethical Implementation of Artificial Intelligence to Select Embryos in In Vitro Fertilization,"AI has the potential to revolutionize many areas of healthcare. Radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology are some of the areas most likely to be impacted in the near future, and they have received significant attention from the broader research community. But AI techniques are now also starting to be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF), in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but must be done carefully and transparently, as the ethical issues are significant, in part because this field involves creating new people. We first give a brief introduction to IVF and review the use of AI for embryo selection. We discuss concerns with the interpretation of the reported results from scientific and practical perspectives. We then consider the broader ethical issues involved. We discuss in detail the problems that result from the use of black-box methods in this context and advocate strongly for the use of interpretable models. Importantly, there have been no published trials of clinical effectiveness, a problem in both the AI and IVF communities, and we therefore argue that clinical implementation at this point would be premature. Finally, we discuss ways for the broader AI community to become involved to ensure scientifically sound and ethically responsible development of AI in IVF.","Afnan, Michael Anis Mihdi and Rudin, Cynthia and Conitzer, Vincent and Savulescu, Julian and Mishra, Abhishek and Liu, Yanhe and Afnan, Masoud","AI, ethics, randomised controlled trials, artificial intelligence, RCT, interpretable, embryo selection, machine learning, in vitro fertilization, black-box, IVF",10.1145/3461702.3462589,2021,11

Recent researches have shown that Medical Radiology imaging may be a more reliable, practical, and rapid method to diagnose and assess COVID-19 in comparison to the official laboratory RT-PCR tests, especially with the lack of medical professionals. In this article, we investigate the aid of Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining techniques to automate the task of diagnosing COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays medical images. The results obtained are promising and are better than previous results published earlier.","Kharbat, Faten F. and Elamsy, Tarik A. and Hamada, Nuha H.","AI, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, COVID-19",10.1145/3388440.3415987,2020,5
inproceedings,Analysis on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Global Value Chain Upgrade of Manufacturing Enterprises,"Since the reform and opening up, Chinese manufacturing enterprises have actively participated in the global value chain division of labor, and their international competitiveness has been continuously strengthened. However, due to the lack of core technologies and market channels, manufacturing enterprises are still at the low end of the global value chain. Artificial intelligence can be deeply integrated with manufacturing enterprises by combining with Internet big data technology. It can promote the global value chain upgrade of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Based on this background, this paper first analyzes the reasons for the low-end locking of the value chain of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, which are due to the locking of comparative advantage, foreign technology and brand market. Then, this paper combs the theoretical mechanism of artificial intelligence promoting the upgrading of global value chain of manufacturing enterprises. Artificial intelligence can upgrade the global value chain by reducing the production cost of manufacturing enterprises, improving the effect of technological innovation and the efficiency of information circulation. Finally, this paper sorts out the concrete measures of applying artificial intelligence technology to manufacturing enterprises in China, and emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence for upgrading the global value chain of manufacturing enterprises [1].","Lin, Rui",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495408,2022,5

inproceedings,A Meta-Analysis of the Utility of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Human-AI Decision-Making,"Research in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making is experiencing tremendous growth with a constantly rising number of studies evaluating the effect of AI with and without techniques from the field of explainable AI (XAI) on human decision-making performance. However, as tasks and experimental setups vary due to different objectives, some studies report improved user decision-making performance through XAI, while others report only negligible effects. Therefore, in this article, we present an initial synthesis of existing research on XAI studies using a statistical meta-analysis to derive implications across existing research. We observe a statistically positive impact of XAI on users' performance. Additionally, the first results indicate that human-AI decision-making tends to yield better task performance on text data. However, we find no effect of explanations on users' performance compared to sole AI predictions. Our initial synthesis gives rise to future research investigating the underlying causes and contributes to further developing algorithms that effectively benefit human decision-makers by providing meaningful explanations.","Schemmer, Max and Hemmer, Patrick and Nitsche, Maximilian and K\""{u}hl, Niklas and V\""{o}ssing, Michael","empirical studies, meta-analysis, decision-making, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3514094.3534128,2022,10

This analysis utilized simulation modeling and artificial intelligence. We have built several discrete and system dynamics simulation models of the current Panama Canal operations and the future expansion which have been validated with historical and projected data and Turing/expert validation by engineers of the Panama Canal Authority. The simulation models have been exercised in order to generate enough information about the future expansion. This information has been used to develop neural networks that have the capability to indicate the volume of the Gatun Lake and its respective salinity taking into consideration lockages, spillovers, hydropower generation, fresh water supply volumes, and environmental factors such as precipitation, tides, and evaporation. Support vector machines were used to build time series regression models of the evaporation of Gatun Lake.","Rabelo, Luis and Cruz, Liliana and Bhide, Sayli and Joledo, Oloruntomi and Pastrana, John and Xanthopoulos, Petros",No data,No data,2014,12

inproceedings,A Survey of Application of Artificial Intelligence Method in Text Emotion Analysis,"Human emotion analysis is a very extensive research field, which can be realized by a variety of applications. To engage in any project related to emotion detection, you must collect available models, data sets, and performance statistics related to it. The purpose of this review analysis is to integrate a unique and advanced set of methods proposed and/or implemented by everyone in the field. The research work of this paper mainly focuses on two aspects of classification, one is the classification based on research objects, the other is the classification based on research methods. The research object is mainly the difference between short text and normal text. The research methods mainly focus on machine learning, such as deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It can be seen from the comparison results that depth learning training is the best at a specific number of layers. If the number of layers is too many or too few, it will lead to insufficient accuracy or a waste of training time. Finally, this paper also puts forward feasible future research directions to provide readers with reference.","Lou, Xiang","Machine learning, Deep belief network, Recursive neural network, Emotion analysis, Convolutional neural networks, Support vector machine",10.1145/3497623.3497675,2022,6
inproceedings,Local Wisdom-Based Scientific Writing Skills in Indonesian Language General Course in Higher Education,"Scientific writing is one of the most difficult linguistic abilities to master. Many individuals find it difficult to master writing skills. This study aims to facilitate students in writing scientific papers. The ability to write scientific papers is one of the skills that every student should develop since it will help them complete their final assignment. As a result, a lecturer should produce scholars with exceptional academic knowledge as well as powerful and clever personalities. This is a preliminary study of the current situation. In the learning process of the Indonesian Language general course, a qualitative method was employed to enhance students' scientific writing skills. The research data were the students’ writing, which includes rational and empirical data. It can be solved by combining learning with local wisdom in scientific paper writing to encourage students to develop their scientific writing skills and understanding of text structures precisely. This study also aims to enhance scientific writing skills by incorporating students in independent research as part of a lesson plan. Based on the findings, this method has proven to be effective in improving students' scientific writing skills, so it needs to continue to be developed in the general course of Indonesian Language learning and is expected to be the right alternative for the lecturers to develop professional skills.","Suprihatin, Dewi and Winarni, Retno and Saddhono, Kundharu and Eko Wardani, Nugraheni",No data,10.1145/3516875.3516895,2022,5
inproceedings,Towards Smarter Public Budgeting? Understanding the Potential of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Support Decision Making in Government,"The use of artificial intelligence in government and its implications to society have generated widespread interest from research and practice communities. However, the analysis of artificial intelligence techniques as a tool to support government decision-making in specific functions is still scarce. For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.","Valle-Cruz, David and Gil-Garcia, J.

inproceedings,Predicting E-Commerce Sales of Hedonic Information Goods via Artificial Intelligence Imagery Analysis of Thumbnails,"In e-commerce, thumbnail images serve as concise visual summaries of complex hedonic information goods, such as books, movies or games. Despite thumbnails' omnipresence and their assumed effect on sales, they largely constitute a black box for research and practice. This work aims to fill this gap and asks, with regard to hedonic information goods: What is the role of thumbnails in the purchase process and how and why do their basic, conceptual and social features impact sales? To answer the question, we first analytically and empirically show that thumbnails play a more central role in the purchase process for hedonic information goods than for other types of goods. Next, we develop a variance model on how and why thumbnails affect sales. Using artificial intelligence imagery analysis, we test the model against evidence from sales data of 100,000 hedonic information goods from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings entail theoretical contributions to the growing field of consumers' visual information processing in e-commerce contexts and lead us to implications for managerial practice.","Cremer, Stefan and Ma, Alice Kyungran","artificial intelligence imagery analysis, visual perception, hedonic information goods, consumer choice",10.1145/3154943.3154950,2017,8

Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students’ perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops’ influence on student perceptions of Alexa’s intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students’ perceptions of Alexa’s friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.","Van Brummelen, Jessica and Tabunshchyk, Viktoriya and Heng, Tommy","AI education, child-agent interaction, conversational agents, pedagogical agent design, persona",10.1145/3459990.3460730,2021,9

article,"A Descriptive Analysis of Collective Intelligence Publications since 2000, and the Emerging Influence of Artificial Intelligence","Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research.

To effectively leverage this burgeoning CI-rich landscape, researchers need extensive benchmark data to maximize performance gains and map their workflows to appropriate architectures. This data will further assist CI administrators, NSF program officers, and CI allocation-reviewers make informed determinations on CI-resource allocations. Here, we compare the performance of two very different architectures: the commonly used Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the new generation of Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs), by running training benchmarks of common AI/ML models. We leverage the maturity of software stacks, and the ease of migration among these platforms to learn that performance and scaling are similar for both architectures. Exploring training parameters, such as batch size, however finds that owing to memory processing structures, IPUs run efficiently with smaller batch sizes, while GPUs benefit from large batch sizes to extract sufficient parallelism in neural network training and inference. This comes with different advantages and disadvantages as discussed in this paper.As such considerations of inference latency, inherent parallelism and model accuracy will play a role in researcher selection of these architectures.

article,AIDCOV: An Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model for Detection of COVID-19 from Chest Radiography Images,"As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow globally, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains the primary strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. In this study, an Artificial Intelligence model for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV) is developed to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependencies among features and improves model performance while an attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. We used several publicly available datasets of both computed tomography (CT) and X-ray modalities. The main public dataset for chest X-ray images contains 475 COVID-19 samples, 3949 samples from other viral/bacterial infections, and 1583 normal samples. Our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.4%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.8%, a specificity of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.8% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on that dataset. Using a large dataset of CT images, our model obtained mean cross-validation accuracy and sensitivity of 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Additionally, our interpretable model can distinguish subtle signs of infection within each radiography image. Assuming these results hold up in larger datasets obtained from a variety of patients over the world, AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19, prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers, and highlight the areas in the lungs that show signs of COVID-related damage.","Zokaeinikoo, Maryam and Kazemian, Pooyan and Mitra, Prasenjit and Kumara, Soundar","convolutional neural networks, chest X-ray, chest CT, COVID-19, attention, deep learning, pneumonia, transfer learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3466690,2021,20

inproceedings,A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Government and Its Potential from a Public Policy Perspective,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend being implemented in the public sector. Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.","Valle-Cruz, David and Alejandro Ruvalcaba-Gomez, Edgar and Sandoval-Almazan, Rodrigo and Ignacio Criado, J.","Public Policy, Government, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3325112.3325242,2019,9
inproceedings,Design and Implementation of Virtual Dance Training System under the Background of Artificial Intelligence Technology,"As a social dance, sports dance is a form of communication between countries, and it is also an art that cannot be replaced by language. Since it was introduced to China, the speed of development in China has been extremely rapid, and sports dance training institutions have gradually developed throughout the country. However, traditional dance learning and dance communication are basically restricted to dance classrooms, resulting in a limited range of communication, fewer objects to communicate, and excellent dance experience and dance resources cannot be shared, which is not conducive to the improvement of the personal level of dancers. Based on the above reasons, the research on dance training is of great significance. This article first introduces the current status of dance training, and then uses artificial intelligence technology to design and implement a virtual dance training system. Finally, a final test is conducted on the functional requirements and performance requirements of the system. The test results show the virtual dance training system designed in this paper. The dance training system is stable and easy to use.","Mao, Yigang",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483164,2021,5
inproceedings,Research on the Influencing Factors of User Trust Based on Artificial Intelligence Self Diagnosis System,"Artificial intelligence technology has gradually become an important auxiliary means for people to obtain medical consultation. However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust. At the end of this paper, some suggestions are put forward to design an interpretable and reliable intelligent self diagnosis system.","Li, Weiheng and Fan, Xiangmin and Zhu, He and Wu, Jingzheng and Teng, Dongxing","artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, user trust",10.1145/3393527.3393561,2020,6

inproceedings,Evaluation of an Online Intervention to Teach Artificial Intelligence with LearningML to 10-16-Year-Old Students,"The inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is increasingly highlighted by international organizations and governments around the world as a cornerstone to enable the adoption of AI in society. That is why we have developed LearningML, aiming to provide a platform that supports educators and students in the creation of hands-on AI projects, specifically based on machine learning techniques. In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online. In order to assess the AI knowledge we created a test that includes different kinds of questions based on previous investigations and publications - resulting in a reliable assessment instrument. Our findings show that the initiative had a positive impact on participants? AI knowledge, being the enhancement especially important for those learners who initially showed less familiarity with the topic. We observe, for instance, that while previous ideas on AI revolve around the term robot, after the experience they do around solve and problem. Based on these results we suggest that LearningML can be seen as a promising platform for the teaching and learning of AI in K-12 environments. In addition, researchers and educators can make use of the new instrument we provide to evaluate future educational interventions.","Rodr\'{\i}guez-Garc\'{\i}a, Juan David and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Robles, Gregorio","artificial intelligence, machine learning, assessment, computational thinking, K-12",10.1145/3408877.3432393,2021,7
inproceedings,What Do Construction Workers Know about Artificial Intelligence? An Exploratory Case Study in an Austrian SME,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is by now used in many different work settings, including construction industry. As new technologies change business and work processes, one important aspect is to understand how potentially affected workers perceive and understand the existing and upcoming AI in their work environment. In this work, we present the results of an exploratory case study with 20 construction workers in a small Austrian company about their knowledge of and attitudes toward AI. Our results show that construction workers’ understanding of AI as a concept is rather superficial, diffuse, and vague, often linked to physical and tangible entities such as robots, and often based on inappropriate sources of information which can lead to misconceptions about AI and AI anxiety. Learning opportunities for promoting (future) construction workers’ AI literacy should be accessible and understandable for learners at various educational levels and encompass aspects such as i) conveying the basics of digitalization, automation, and AI to enable a clear distinction of these concepts, ii) building on the learners’ actual experience realm, i.e., taking into account their focus on physical, tangible, and visible entities, and iii) reducing AI anxiety by elaborating on the limits of AI.","Maitz, Katharina and Fessl, Angela and Pammer-Schindler, Viktoria and Kaiser, Rene and Lindstaedt, Stefanie","Construction Industry, AI Literacy, Case Study, AI Anxiety",10.1145/3543758.3547545,2022,5

inproceedings,The Transformation and Practice of Accounting Professional Training in Colleges and Universities Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology,"With the development of my country's economy and society, especially the development of the global economy under the conditions of informatization, professional talents have made obvious contributions to economic and social development. Colleges and universities (CU) have initially established a training model for accounting professionals (APS) in line with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, problems in the training of accounting talents (AT) have also emerged. How the talents trained in the accounting profession can better satisfy the needs of social development, especially the needs of corporate development, has not been solved very effectively for a long time. At present, the influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on education is deepening, and artificial intelligence technology (AIT) is also promoting the transformation of talent training in CU. This article mainly uses questionnaire survey method and data analysis method to study the transformation and practice of accounting professional (AP) training in CU, and is intended to explore the transformation of AP training in CU under the blessing of AIT. Analyzed the opinions of college accounting students on the AP curriculum, and the practical teaching content that they think needs to be strengthened in professional learning. According to the survey results, most interviewees believe that there are problems with the curriculum, too many theoretical classes and fewer practical classes; practical teaching content that needs to be strengthened includes comprehensive training and practical production internships in the school, paying more attention to their own knowledge and practical ability to meet the needs of work. Therefore, the transformation of the training of APS in CU is an inevitable trend.","Chen, Shu",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495429,2022,5

inproceedings,Performance Evaluation of Viral Infection Diagnosis Using T-Cell Receptor Sequence and Artificial Intelligence,"The adaptive immune system expresses millions of different receptors that detect and fight pathogens encountered throughout life. These receptors are encoded by unique DNA sequences that allow immune cells to express millions of different receptors. High-throughput sequencing and analyses of immune cell receptor sequences present a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological responses to infections and to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Even after the infection is eliminated, pathogen-specific immune cells and their receptor sequences are present at higher frequencies than prior to infection, and their increase in frequency prevents secondary infections. As a result of their persistence in the body, they may be useful for diagnosing infections and evaluating vaccine efficacy as a stable biomarker. However, this process requires thorough analysis of massive datasets at an accuracy beyond traditional statistical tests to diagnose infectious statuses based on sequence analyses. Here we evaluate various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to measure the performance of the identification and diagnosis of specific viral infections or vaccination statuses using the publicly available mouse (monkeypox infection and smallpox vaccination) and human (cytomegalovirus serostatus) T-cell receptor sequenced datasets.

inproceedings,Note: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Build a Data Catalog and Support Research on the Sustainable Development Goals,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the framework adopted by the global community to encourage taking actions on the multiple challenges facing the world today to ensure environmental protection, health and well-being, and economic prosperity. This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDGs related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics.

inproceedings,The Right Tool for The Job? Assessing the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Identifying Administrative Errors,"This article explores the extent to which machine learning can be used to detect administrative errors. It concentrates on administrative errors in unemployment insurance (UI) decisions, which give rise to a public values conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. This conflict is first described and then highlighted in the history of the US UI regime. Machine learning may not only mitigate this conflict but it may also help to combat fraud and reduce the backlog of claims associated with economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The article uses data about improper UI payments throughout the US from 2002 through 2018 to analyze the accuracy of random forests and deep learning models. We find that a random forest model using gradient descent boosting is more accurate, along several measures, than every deep learning model tested. This finding could be explained by the goodness-of-fit between the machine learning method and the available data. Alternatively, deep learning performance could be attenuated by necessary limits to publicly-accessible claims data.","Young, Matthew and Himmelreich, Johannes and Honcharov, Danylo and Soundarajan, Sucheta","AI, Administrative Errors, Public Administration, Social Policy, Unemployment Insurance",10.1145/3463677.3463714,2021,12

HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.","Choi, Yongjin and Gil-Garcia, Ramon and Aranay, Oguz and Burke, Brian and Werthmuller, Derek","deep neural network, harmful algal blooms, random forest, artificial intelligence, evidence based policy",10.1145/3463677.3463713,2021,11

inproceedings,AIMMX: Artificial Intelligence Model Metadata Extractor,"Despite all of the power that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models bring to applications, much of AI development is currently a fairly ad hoc process. Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. Our platform extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models.","Tsay, Jason and Braz, Alan and Hirzel, Martin and Shinnar, Avraham and Mummert, Todd","Machine Learning, Model Catalog, Model Mining, Artificial Intelligence, Model Metadata, Metadata Extraction",10.1145/3379597.3387448,2020,12
inproceedings,Teaching Modelling Literacy: An Artificial Intelligence Approach,"In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.","Saini, Rijul and Mussbacher, Gunter and Guo, Jin L.

inproceedings,Public Decision Making: Connecting Artificial Intelligence and Crowds,"The recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence, as well as the wide adoption of the wisdom of the crowd, also known as collective intelligence, across sectors, has received attention and excitement across disciplines. In addition to the scientific breakthrough, recent public sector studies recognize AI's potential contributions in public services, such as big data for decision making, the development of smart cities, and social and health care. Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature. Our study provides key themes and significance for each cluster. Our first examination of AI and crowd literature regarding connection to public values, complementary in public decision making, as well as future potential for joint adoption by governments provides some implications for future considerations.","K.

This work explores the value of relationships as a purposeful technique for achieving goals when no established process exists, issues are complex, or resources are scarce - scenarios which are all too familiar in Information Technology. A brief literature review sets the stage for gaining a better understanding of what drives various college and university environments and their organizational behavior models. Bases of Power are addressed as an academic concept related to influence tactics and their expected outcomes. Coupling an understanding of Higher Education cultural settings, power, and influence tactics we will examine how university decisions are made, and practical methods for directing those decisions towards desired outcomes within IT and throughout the campus communities we support. The value of relationships as an influence technique is established and strategies for how and when to cultivate relationships are discussed as they pertain to staff in diverse roles, from front-line support to CIO.

For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence -- a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict.

inproceedings,Ns3-Ai: Fostering Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Networking Research,"Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved its momentum in various areas such as image processing and natural language processing thanks to the advances in processing speed, data acquisition and storage. Many research efforts have been exerted to apply AI to computer networking. Performance evaluation of network systems using AI techniques can be conducted using ns-3, and such studies can be facilitated if ns-3 is able to interact with the existing open-source AI frameworks. In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework. This ns-3 extension module may foster the performance evaluation of AI algorithms in computer networking research with much reduced development workload.","Yin, Hao and Liu, Pengyu and Liu, Keshu and Cao, Liu and Zhang, Lytianyang and Gao, Yayu and Hei, Xiaojun","network simulation, AI, ns-3",10.1145/3389400.3389404,2020,8
inproceedings,XAI4FL: Enhancing Spectrum-Based Fault Localization with Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Manually finding the program unit (e.g., class, method, or statement) responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. A popular family of such techniques is spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), which takes program execution traces (spectra) of failed and passed test cases as input and applies a ranking formula to compute a suspiciousness score for each program unit. However, most existing SBFL techniques fail to consider two facts: 1) not all failed test cases contribute equally to a considered fault(s), and 2) program units collaboratively contribute to the failure/pass of each test case in different ways.In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Applying XAI to the failed test case, we retrieve information about which program statements within the test case that are considered the most important (i.e., have the biggest effect in making the test case failed). Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.We compare the performance of our approach against five popular SBFL techniques: DStar, Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and OP. We measure their performance using the Top-K and EXAM scores. In particular, we focus on the result of the Top-1, which importance has been highlighted in automated program repair domain, where the proposed methods often assume perfect fault localization (i.e., the fault must be found at the first rank of the suspiciousness list). Our results show that our approach, named XAI4FL, has a statistically significant and substantially better performance in terms of Top-1 than the SBFL approaches. We also compare our approach with a simpler approach to get feature importance in a tree-based model (i.e., using the Mean Decrease in Impurity method). Our results show that XAI4FL statistically significantly outperforms the MDI method in Top-K and EXAM score. Our results and findings highlight that the utilization of XAI for fault localization can improve the overall results of fault localization techniques.","Widyasari, Ratnadira and Prana, Gede Artha Azriadi and Haryono, Stefanus A. and Tian, Yuan and Zachiary, Hafil Noer and Lo, David","fault localization, model-agnostic explanation technique, testing and debugging, spectrum-based fault localization, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)",10.1145/3524610.3527902,2022,12

Teaching Artificial Intelligence to Freshmen in an Introductory Computer Science Course,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more widely utilized, there is a need for non-computer scientists to understand 1) how the technology works, and 2) how it can impact their lives. Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.","de Freitas, Adrian A. and Weingart, Troy B.","machine learning, computer science education, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3408877.3432530,2021,7

However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.","Denisova, Alena and Cairns, Paul","immersion, player knowledge, player experience, adaptive artificial intelligence, biasing effects",10.1145/2793107.2793109,2015,11

However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.","Lin, Kevin","identity, data structures, culturally responsive pedagogy, political vision, critical pedagogy, cultural competence, ethics, social justice",10.1145/3478431.3499291,2022,7

inproceedings,Regulating for 'Normal AI Accidents': Operational Lessons for the Responsible Governance of Artificial Intelligence Deployment,"New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such 'normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.","Maas, Matthijs M.","normal accident theory, ai and law, trust and explanations in ai systems, ethical design and development of ai systems",10.1145/3278721.3278766,2018,6
inproceedings,The State of the ML-Universe: 10 Years of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Software Development on GitHub,"In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous terms. These powerful techniques have escaped obscurity in academic communities with the recent onslaught of AI &amp; ML tools, frameworks, and libraries that make these techniques accessible to a wider audience of developers. As a result, applying AI &amp; ML to solve existing and emergent problems is an increasingly popular practice. However, little is known about this domain from the software engineering perspective. Many AI &amp; ML tools and applications are open source, hosted on platforms such as GitHub that provide rich tools for large-scale distributed software development. Despite widespread use and popularity, these repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique properties, development patterns, and trends.In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of AI &amp; ML Tool (700) and Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a characterization. While not the only platform hosting AI &amp; ML development, GitHub facilitates collecting a rich data set for each repository with high traceability between issues, commits, pull requests and users. To compare the AI &amp; ML community to the wider population of repositories, we also analyzed a set of 4,101 unrelated repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a repository. We've captured key insights of this community's 10 year history such as it's primary language (Python) and most popular repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI &amp; ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in future research.","Gonzalez, Danielle and Zimmermann, Thomas and Nagappan, Nachiappan","artificial intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, GitHub, mining software repositories, Open Source",10.1145/3379597.3387473,2020,12

inproceedings,"I Lead, You Help but Only with Enough Details: Understanding User Experience of Co-Creation with Artificial Intelligence","Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have increased the opportunities for users to interact with the technology. Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user--AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.","Oh, Changhoon and Song, Jungwoo and Choi, Jinhan and Kim, Seonghyeon and Lee, Sungwoo and Suh, Bongwon","human-ai interaction, artificial intelligence, human computer collaboration",10.1145/3173574.3174223,2018,13

inproceedings,Accelerating Public Service Delivery in India: Application of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.","Malhotra, Charru and Anand, Rashmi",No data,10.1145/3428502.3428510,2020,8
inproceedings,A Data Mining Approach for Student Referral Service of the Guidance Center: An Input in Designing Mediation Scheme for Higher Education Institutions of the Philippines,"The academic guidance office of an educational institution holds pertinent data of all the students in the institution such as psychological examination results, students' referral records and the like. Further, the office offered orientation services, testing services, counseling and follow-up services, individual inventory services, career guidance services, research &amp; evaluation services and placement services. In this paper, a data mining approach was used to produce a trend analysis through time series and forecasted data using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) of the student referral details from one of the Higher Education Institutions in the Philippines. Student referral historical data from the second semester of school year 2016- 2017, first semester of school year 2017-2018, second semester of school year 2017-2018 and the first semester of school year 2018- 2019 was used in the study. Results showed that absenteeism, poor attendance and poor academic performance were the highest number of recorded students' referrals over the others in which poor attendance yields a decreasing pattern among the three. On the other hand, based on the forecasted data, only poor academic performance and poor attendance showed a slight increasing patterns among others. These further signify that a proper program should be in place by the school counselors in mitigating the occurrence of referrals especially on the reasons showing an increase of prediction data.","Cabrera, Joey A. and Orong, Markdy Y. and Capio, Nelpa N. and Filarca, Arnel and Neri, Eden and Clarin, Ariel R.","ARIMA, Prediction, Moving Average, Time Series, GRETL",10.1145/3378936.3378958,2020,5

inproceedings,What Do You See? Evaluation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Interpretability through Neural Backdoors,"EXplainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret how a deep neural network predicts inputs through model saliency explanations that highlight the input parts deemed important to arrive at a decision for a specific target. However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region.

inproceedings,InuAid Chest X-Rays AI Product: Respiratory Diseases Detection Using Artificial Intelligence to Significantly Improve Productivity and Quality of Diagnosis,"The spread of Covid-19 virus around the world has taken many lives, quarantined people and shattered many industries. Due to high transmissibility of the virus and its silent incubation period in human beings, detection of the virus plays an important role to control its spread and to plan diagnostic and preventive measures. Laboratory tests such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) take more time and hence there is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to detect the virus to prevent its spread and combat it. Today PCR tests were used for diagnosing purposes and the chest x-ray was only used as the follow up of patients, hence these studies on the chest x-rays of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia or any other disease are still limited to the literature and must be improved in the future. In this project, the goal is to build an application for healthcare workers to monitor the health of lungs using the chest x-ray images of patients. The algorithm must be very accurate because it deals with the lives of people. Here we used computer vision and deep learning techniques in this project. The focus is to classify chest x-ray images and segment the abnormal region and to get more insights on the images from the available datasets. The diagnostic accuracy is the challenging part and to increase the detection efficiency due to the limited open-source data available. The data was collected from the internet. On classification, the trained model was able to achieve 93.10% accuracy and F1 Score of 0.93 after using transfer learning technique with pneumonia images. On segmentation, the Intersection Over Union value was found to be 0.91 on the validation data.","Kumar S.

inproceedings,From Temporary Shelter to Permanent Dwelling: Optimizing the Spatial Organization of Refugee Camps in Jordan through Artificial Intelligence,"Refugee camps are defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as “temporary facilities built to provide immediate protection and assistance to people who were forced to flee their homes due to war, persecution or violence”. The average lifespan of a refugee camp is seventeen years after which they organically transition into new towns. This paper uses Jordan as a case study, as it has been the country hosting the largest number of refugees since 1947. Daily practices by refugees subvert the initial planned camp into organic formations suitable for their changing needs, overriding the rigid built environment which no longer serves them. Addressing SDGs number 10: Reduced Inequalities, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 17: Partnerships of change, this ongoing research assesses the use of segmentation algorithms as a first step in identifying morphological patterns in the built environment and understanding transient scenarios of a refugee camp's spatial organization. By understanding patterns of spatial change, the inevitable transition from temporary to permanent settlement can be guided away from “slummification” and towards creating adequate low-income housing for refugees in Jordan.","Marji, Noor and Kohout, Michal",No data,10.1145/3569219.3569363,2022,5

inproceedings,Adaptive E-Learning: Adaptation of Content According to the Continuous Evolution of the Learner During His Training,"Higher education has always been based on a traditional education system. All learners have to attend all training courses without taking into consideration human and logistical constraints. This situation leads to major problems of massification, which unfortunately subsequently lead to problems of demotivation or even abandonment of a large number of students.A solution to these problems resides in introduction of distance learning. The implementation of online courses, such as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), and the emergence of educational platforms such as LMS (Learning Management System) or LCMS (Learning Content Management System), have made it possible to introduce the notion of e-learning into Higher education. Nevertheless, if e-learning has left the Stone Age elsewhere, it is still an emerging field in some countries as Morocco where it is far from having reached maturity. Like any new system or proposal, e-learning has its own detractors who need to be more reassured on certain aspects.In this article, we deal with some major issues related to e-learning platforms, which offer pre-established pedagogical content without really taking into account the particularity or evolution of each learner during the training path. We will therefore talk about a customised or adaptive e-learning.

inproceedings,An Elephant in the Learning Analytics Room: The Obligation to Act,"As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.","Prinsloo, Paul and Slade, Sharon","learning analytics, obligation to act ethics",10.1145/3027385.3027406,2017,10

One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future.Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics. In this paper, we consider how a visual analytic process can present difficult data science concepts. We present an interactive visual educational tool to teach data science to high school students. The first activity introduces the visual analytic pipeline. The next interactive activities present machine learning classification and regression topics. We select datasets and applications which are relatable to our main audience. This paper describes the design and implementation of the data science educational tool for high school students.","Chittora, Siddharth and Baynes, Anna","interactive visualization, high school computer science education",10.1145/3368308.3415360,2020,6
inproceedings,Imagining Better Futures for Everybody – Sustainable Entrepreneurship Education for Future Design Protagonists,"Previous research has shown the need for children to grow to ‘design protagonists’, developing skills and competences in technology design and being able to reflect on the role of technology in their own lives as well as in the society. Entrepreneurship understanding has been linked as one important competence for design protagonists, for having skills to plan for and reflect on a better future for all of us. To advance understanding on how to support children to grow to design protagonists in areas connected to technology, business, and sustainability, we conducted a study with 14-15-year-olds, educating them first about artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable business thinking, and asking them then to create and present business ideas for sustainable innovations that use AI. Based on the findings, we indicate the need to link systems thinking approaches with this type of education and we provide some recommendations for practice.","Kinnula, Marianne and Durall, Eva and Haukipuro, Lotta","Learning, Innovation education, Artificial intelligence, Protagonist, Sustainability, Entrepreneurship education, Children",10.1145/3535227.3535229,2022,8

inproceedings,IoT and AI Based Intelligent System to Fight against COVID-19,"In this global health crisis, several efforts have been launched to monitor and control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those efforts require the support of new technologies like the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Image and Video Processing, Big Data, and Machine Learning to tackle various problems related to this viral pandemic. In these circumstances, public places such as hospitals, public transportation, and supermarkets need a more scientific and practical system/guidance to identify the probable COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we design an Internet of Things-Artificial Intelligence IoT-AI based intelligent system to monitor the suspect cases in public places. Based on implicit/Explicit data acquisition flow, the system provides information to public authorities. In a public place, the actions of suspicious people are collected by sensors such as thermal cameras, connected cameras, and Smartphone embedded sensors. Subsequently, this data is sent to the system for analysis. Thanks to artificial intelligence technology, the system can extract useful information to determine suspicious COVID-19 cases. In this article, we will describe the proposed global system. The design of this type of system is a trend for the future wider application to deal with COVID-19.","Bouchareb, Asmae and Boulaalam, Abdelhak and Bellamine, Insaf","COVID-19, Action recognition, Coronavirus, Artificial intelligence, IoT",10.1145/3454127.3457618,2021,8
inproceedings,Information Extraction Tasks in Public Administration Domain: ISIDA-T Natural Language Processing System,"This article represents approaches of the artificial intelligence methods, used in public administration. An overview of various technologies of artificial intelligence applications in the field of public administration and related fields is given. All of these research directions are particularly relevant to the task of digital technologies (including artificial intelligence) growth to create an efficient and competitive digital economics in Russia. Among the modern intellectual technologies that allow solving the widest range of tasks, an important role plays technologies related to natural language text processing - nonstructured NL-texts are essential segment of data, used for analysis and decision-making tasks (in terms of data volume, of course, video data have a leading position, however, they are usually suitable for solving tactical but not strategic management tasks). The article provides an overview of the existing methods of natural language processing and their practical application to the tasks of public administration. An integrated approach to the natural language processing tools using for solving practical problems in the field of public administration is considered on the example of the ISIDA-T system for extracting information from natural language texts, developed at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center PSI RAS. The system under consideration is distinguished by a modular approach to the pre-processing of unstructured text and the possibility of manual adjustment for a specific extraction task. This technological solution gives the necessary flexibility and ease of use. The system consists of configurable text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, target information retrieval and output of the results in user-friendly form modules. One of the important components of the system is an integrated knowledge resource that allows quickly and efficiently adjust the system to the specifics of the relevant subject area. An approach to the application of the ISIDA-T system to the task of fact information extraction (as the most important for analyzing the situation and subsequent management decisions) is proposed using the example of information extraction about resignations and appointments from news feeds.","Vinogradov, Andrei and Kurshev, Evgeny and Vlasova, Natalia and Podobryaev, Alexey","Natural language processing, Public administration, Information extraction, Artificial intelligence, Digital economy",10.1145/3373722.3373782,2020,10
inproceedings,Experience of Online Education for Students in Hungary,"The March 2020 epidemic in Europe required a shift to online education at all levels of education. Many teachers were caught unprepared, compounded by a lack of the necessary hardware tools and a lack of mastery in selecting and managing software that supports teaching properly. For the second wave in autumn 2020, educational institutions were better prepared in Hungary and universities had already experienced hybrid education to some extent. Now, after the third wave, a lot of experience has been gathered from both the teaching and student sides. Based on the students' experiences, we analyse how they would like to listen to lectures, practicals and labs at university. The results of the analysis show that students are open to online learning for lectures, but still prefer face-to-face classes for tutorials and labs. The students' views will help to inform the way in which higher education institutions should deliver courses at the end of the pandemic period, which will also help to rationalise the way universities operate in the future in Hungary.","Kiss, Gabor","Hungary, Prefered education form, Higher education, Online education",10.1145/3545922.3545933,2022,6

inproceedings,A Contextualized Project-Based Approach for Improving Student Engagement and Learning in AI Courses,"Project MLeXAI, Machine Learning Experiences in Artificial Intelligence, is a multi-institutional project that has been funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The goal is to develop a framework for teaching core Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics with a unifying theme of machine learning. The objectives are to enhance student learning experiences in the AI course by implementing a unifying theme of machine learning to tie together the diverse and seemingly disconnected topics in the AI course, to increase student interest and motivation to learn AI, and to introduce students to an increasingly important research area. To that end, a suite of hands-on term-long projects and associated curricular modules have been developed. Each project involves the design and implementation of a learning system which enhances a particular commonly-deployed AI application. In addition, the projects provide students with an opportunity to address not only core AI topics but also many of the issues central to computer science, including algorithmic complexity and scalability problems.Phase I of the project involved the development and testing of a prototype at three institutions: a small liberal arts college, a medium comprehensive university, and a state university. Phase II builds on phase I work and involves further development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI through a unifying theme of machine learning. The goal of phase II was to increase the number of modules and expand the implementation and testing to include a larger and more diverse set of colleges and universities.In this paper we present results of phase II assessment of the collaborative development, dissemination, and separate testing of the projects at the institutions of twenty participating faculty members.

inproceedings,Actualization of Environmental Education as an Innovative and Digital Resource for Sustainable Regional Development,"The scientific and expert community does not fully explore such a factor of sustainable regional development as actualization of environmental education. The goal of this research is to develop a list of prospective majors in the higher education system for solving current ecological challenges ensuring stable regional development. We have made a predictive assessment of the demand for prospective majors in environmental science, which is not limited to the study of the need for such personnel strictly in the labor market. A number of factors that influence people's preferences when choosing promising areas of environmental education was taken into account, such as: the industry development in the field of renewable energy; the worldwide search for a waste-free model of plastic recycling; the global scientific, technological and innovative character of regional economy development, etc. The results of this study are based on expert opinions from the environmentally-oriented scientific community and employers in the Tula region, who took part in the online survey through questionnaires. The opinion of rectors of leading universities, as well as their staff and students, on the functioning of the higher education system in the area of environmental science considering its actualization was of no less importance.

inproceedings,Forecasting Learner Attrition for Student Success at a South African University,In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students’ risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students’ risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student’s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions.

College students are the main users of MOOCs, and the ability of autonomous learning is particularly important in the context of MOOCs. However, many college students still have problems in autonomous emotion, autonomous intelligence and autonomous behavior. Based on the advantages of rich MOOC resources and convenient operation, this article proposes strategies for college students to improve their learning autonomy. It includes the following three aspects. The first is to stimulate internal motivation and increase the consciousness of autonomy; the second is to use cognitive strategies to strengthen autonomous intelligence; the third is to use metacognitive strategies to monitor autonomous behavior.","Du, Wei","Learning Autonomy, College Students, MOOC",10.1145/3502434.3502481,2022,5
inproceedings,Monitoring Of Students' Soft Skills Development Within Foreign Language Learning Using Online Technologies,"Digital transformation in the world poses new challenges for workers: employers now demand employees possessing excellent professional, management, and communication skills. But modern higher education is not ready for developing such soft skills due to several problems occurred: (1) a lack of a unified typology of soft skills; (2) differences in understanding of importance of developing soft skills between students, higher education professionals, and employers; (3) unavailability and the lack of focus of higher education institutions on the development of students' soft skills; (4) the lack of valid methodologies for developing soft skills. The author used a method of content analysis of scientific literature and found out that there is relevance and necessity of improving students' soft skills and for managing this process in digital environment pedagogical monitoring can be used as it provides opportunities for well-timed control and solving occurring problems.Consequently, the aim of the research was to design a model for monitoring students' soft skills development using online technologies. The designed model includes usage of different types of monitoring and various learning and controlling teaching technologies. The experiment was carried out within foreign language learning as it can provide useful means of soft skills development. The study involved 226 first-year students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and was aimed at developing 3 categories of soft skills: communication, management, professional skills. Based on the content analysis, soft skills were developed using interactive teaching technologies; learning activities were uploaded into the Moodle, as well as testing was online. After utilizing the model proposed we figured out the statistical difference between results obtained during initial, intermediate, and final stages of the experiment, which proved the model's efficiency. Therefore, the model can be useful for soft skills development within foreign language learning in the system of higher education.","Medvedeva, Olesya","soft skills development, Soft skills, quality of higher education, interactive technologies, teaching technologies, foreign language learning, online technologies, pedagogical monitoring",10.1145/3446434.3446551,2021,10

Participants were asked to imagine that they were responsible for the development of an artificial intelligence model in two distinct scenarios: loan applications and university admissions. Regarding Model Cards, the focus of this paper, a thematic analysis of the data suggests that participating developers were selective about which of the ethical issues they reflected upon were actually recorded in their cards. However, participants were hesitant to grant full autonomy to the model they were developing, a contrast with previous studies. These findings may contribute to our current understanding of how developers can leverage epistemic and documentation tools to engage in a more ethically informed design process of artificial intelligence systems.","Nunes, Jos\'{e} Luiz and Barbosa, Gabriel D.

inproceedings,A Framework of Online Learning and Experiment System Based on Affective Computing,"With the development of online education, the problem of emotional deficiency has gradually emerged. In recent years, the research about emotional interaction in online education, and the application of Affective Computing in online education came into being. This paper introduces the impact of Affective Computing on online education, including the use of expressions, speech, eye movement, and physiological signals, as well as text and questionnaires and other modals, or multi-modal to infer students' emotional state and learning state in the learning process, and then to realize personalized learning support. The emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface, can be applied to online education combined with Affective Computing technologies to improve the interaction between learners and the on-line learning system. This paper proposes a framework of online learning and experiment system based on Affective Computing supported by Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface. The system can provide personalized education for students and help them to carry out experiments in a virtual reality environment. The framework can reduce the impact on students in the process of data collection, so that it can obtain more real data, and the framework uses emerging technologies to provide support and reference for emotion analysis and recognition, which will make the analysis and response more timely and emotion recognition more accurate.","Zhou, Yinghui and Tao, Xiaomei","Virtual simulation experiment system, Affective Computing, emerging technologies, E-learning system, Online education",10.1145/3453187.3453405,2021,6
inproceedings,Contextual Intelligence for Unified Data Governance,"Current data governance techniques are very labor-intensive, as teams of data stewards typically rely on best practices to transform business policies into governance rules. As data plays an increasingly key role in today's data-driven enterprises, current approaches do not scale to the complexity and variety present in the data ecosystem of an enterprise as an increasing number of data requirements, use cases, applications, tools and systems come into play. We believe techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning have potential to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in data governance. In this paper, we propose a framework for 'contextual intelligence', where we argue for (1) collecting and integrating contextual metadata from variety of sources to establish a trusted unified repository of contextual data use across users and applications, and (2) applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques over this rich contextual metadata to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in governance practices. We propose an architecture that unifies governance across several systems, with a graph serving as a core repository of contextual metadata, accurately representing data usage across the enterprise and facilitating machine learning, We demonstrate how our approach can enable ML-based recommendations in support of governance best practices.","Seabolt, Ed and Kandogan, Eser and Roth, Mary","Context, Data Governance, Analytics, Graph",10.1145/3211954.3211955,2018,9
inproceedings,A Multiple Case Study of Artificial Intelligent System Development in Industry,"There is a rapidly increasing amount of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems developed in recent years, with much expectation on its capacity of innovation and business value generation. However, the promised value of AI systems in specific business contexts might not be understood, and further integrated into the development processes. We wanted to understand how software engineering processes and practices can be applied to develop AI systems in a fast-faced, business-driven manner. As the first step, we explored contextual factors of AI development and the connections between AI developments to business opportunities. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews in seven companies in Brazil, Norway and Southeast Asia. Our investigation revealed different types of AI systems and different AI development approaches. However, it is common that business opportunities involving with AI systems are not validated and there is lack of business-driven metrics that guide the development of AI systems.

inproceedings,Towards Equity and Algorithmic Fairness in Student Grade Prediction,"Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing, achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student attributes and allow institutions to instrument their AI resources in ways that are attentive to equity and fairness.","Jiang, Weijie and Pardos, Zachary A.","grade prediction, fairness, equity, higher education",10.1145/3461702.3462623,2021,10
inproceedings,Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,"Increased enrolments in higher education, and the shift to online learning that has been escalated by the recent COVID pandemic, have made it challenging for instructors to assist their students with their learning needs. Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students.","Shabaninejad, Shiva and Khosravi, Hassan and Abdi, Solmaz and Indulska, Marta and Sadiq, Shazia","explainable learning analytics, at-risk students, learning analytics dashboards",10.1145/3491140.3528292,2022,5

article,Investigation of the Effect of “Fog of War” in the Prediction of StarCraft Strategy Using Machine Learning,"StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is “fog of war,” which refers to the fact that players cannot see their opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the game means that the information required in order to predicting the opponent's strategy is only available through “scouting.” Although the “fog of war” is one of the most important features of the game, it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the “fog of war” in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs. human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic analysis with “fog of war” reveals the predictability of the machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.","Cho, Hochul and Park, Hyunsoo and Kim, Chang-Yeun and Kim, Kyung-Joong","strategy prediction, machine learning, starcraft, Real-time strategy game, fog of war, AI bots",10.1145/2735384,2016,16

inproceedings,The Landscape of Teaching Resources for AI Education,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) educational resources such as training tools, interactive demos, and dedicated curriculum are increasingly popular among educators and learners. While prior work has examined pedagogies for promoting AI literacy, it has yet to examine how well technology resources support these pedagogies. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic analysis of existing online resources for AI education, investigating what learning and teaching affordances these resources have to support AI education. We used the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework to analyze a final corpus of 50 AI resources. We found that most resources support active learning, have digital or physical dependencies, do not include all the five big ideas defined by AI4K12 guidelines, and do not offer built-in support for assessment or feedback. Teaching guides are hard to find or require technical knowledge. Based on our findings, we propose that future AI curricula move from singular activities and demos to more holistic designs that include support, guidance, and flexibility for how AI technology, concepts, and pedagogy play out in the classroom.","Druga, Stefania and Otero, Nancy and Ko, Amy J.","ai education, teaching support, k12",10.1145/3502718.3524782,2022,7

inproceedings,The Tool for Migrating Learning Content from Moodle to Open EdX,"Massive open online courses are a promising area of interest of higher education institutions in their competition for students. However, typically specialised open platforms are used to create such courses, while courses in higher education institutions are delivered through learning management systems. Thus, a higher education institution meets a severe challenge if it decides to offer its study courses as massive open online courses: the content hosted in the learning management system need to be transferred to another platform or re-created. The automated tools developed for this purpose could (at least partially) speed up the learning content migration process while also reducing the amount of manual work required. The paper presents the research results achieved regarding the migration of the content of Moodle courses into Open edX through the use of the cloud-based automated migration tool. The conceptual migration model is described first. After that, some technical details of the developed tool are discussed.

inproceedings,Automate the Peripheral Arterial Disease Prediction in Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler Study Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks,"This research work aims to automate the prediction of peripheral arterial diseases implied by the Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler (LEAD) studies by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This study is the first to use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze LEAD data for peripheral arterial disease prediction. Specifically, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the waveform into three types. The classified waveforms are used as input to the learning algorithms for disease prediction. We evaluate two traditional machine learning algorithms as well as two neural networks to predict normal and three types of artery diseases: aortoiliac disease, femoral-popliteal arterial disease, and trifurcation disease. The hierarchical neural network model (HNN) is investigated to deal with imbalanced data set. The first level of the HNN predicts the normal from diseases. The remaining two neural networks are used to predict other diseases from the rest. HNN has achieved high F1 scores: 99% on the normal case, 97% on the aortoiliac disease, and 94% on the femoral-popliteal arterial disease and 89% on the trifurcation disease through 10-fold cross-validation. The comparison shows that HNN works better than multilayer perceptron, random forests, and SVM. The overall result demonstrates that machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can be developed for peripheral arterial diseases implied by the LEAD studies while reducing the reading variability in vascular laboratories.","Ara, Lena and Luo, Xiao and Sawchuk, Alan and Rollins, Dave","neural networks, lower extremity arterial doppler, peripheral arterial disease prediction",10.1145/3307339.3342180,2019,6

inproceedings,Students' Performance Tracking in Distributed Open Education Using Big Data Analytics,"The field of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is advancing rapidly, and it is finding adoption in diverse areas such as Health, Commerce, Logistics, Retail and Manufacturing to name a few. Adoption of BDA techniques in the field of Higher Education is new, and it is steadily increasing. In this work, BDA techniques have been applied to track the Key Academic Performance Indicators (KAPIs) related to students at the Arab Open University (AOU) and to support the corresponding decisions in this regard. Since the AOU is a Pan Arab multi-campus distributed institution operating in 8 countries and makes extensive use of a wide range of cloud based applications to manage the students' life cycle, hence it is an ideal candidate for adoption of BDA techniques to track students' KAPIs across the AOU multiple country campuses. In order to achieve this objective, we have used IBM Watson Analytics (WA) platform to track the students' KAPIs. As a pilot project, we have focused in this work on the Information Technology and Computing (ITC) academic programme across the AOU. The Exploration and Business Intelligence BDA capabilities of WA have enabled us to analyze and track the academic KAPIs of the ITC students across AOU country campuses while the Predictive Analytics (PA) has led to identifying the dominant factors behind some of our problems such as students drop out rates. One of the most promising outcomes is the decision support dashboards such as the one related to the Student Risk Factor (SRF).

inproceedings,Features of Calculating Cost of Services in Educational Institutions Based on the ABC Method,"Heads of higher educational institutions seek to optimize costs and increase the effectiveness of the educational institution. In this regard, they need to know how resources are allocated and used by type of activity. Due to its simplicity, direct costing methods are used. Overhead is distributed in proportion to the number of students. Traditional methods of costing the cost of providing services do not allow taking into account all the features of the activities of educational institutions and the business processes that occur in them, which determines the relevance of the research topic. It is necessary to apply methods that allow you to compare management accounting data with the types of activities and determine at what stage the provision of educational services requires improvement. This method is Activity-based costing. The volumes of consumed resources are calculated depending on the types of activities. The purpose of the study is to justify the use of the Activity-based Costing (hereinafter - ABC) parameter when using the cost of training programs for students in higher education. The theoretical and methodological base of the research lies in the works of leading Russian and foreign scientists concerning the substantiation of methods for calculating the cost of products (works, services), accounting regulations. The research methodology is based on the systems approach used to study various calculation systems with general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, comparison, synthesis, grouping and classification. The use of a modern method of cost accounting and production costing ABC will allow higher education institution to form the cost of training students for each course more objectively, which will objectively form the price for paid services and generate more reliable performance indicators of individual departments and chairs. The results of the study can be used in state and commercial institutions of higher education in determining the cost of services for training students in various programs.

inproceedings,Invoking Principles of Groupware to Develop and Evaluate Present and Future Human-Agent Teams,"Advances in artificial intelligence are constantly increasing its validity as a team member enabling it to effectively work alongside humans and other artificial teammates. Unfortunately, the digital nature of artificial teammates and their restrictive communication and coordination requirements complicate the interaction patterns that exist. In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence. The results are a framework that detail human-agent interaction throughout the coming years, which can be used to guide groupware development.","Flathmann, Christopher and Schelble, Beau and Tubre, Brock and McNeese, Nathan and Rodeghero, Paige","human-agent teamwork, artificial intelligence, human-ai, human-agent interaction, groupware",10.1145/3406499.3415072,2020,10
inproceedings,Internet and Cognition-Based Decision Making: A Survey,"Digital technologies represented by the Internet have influenced micro-economic agents' cognitive decisions. We review the effects of Internet technologies on the cognitions and decisions of microeconomic agents systematically. For individuals, the Internet has reshaped their cognition with the information shock, the ""Google effect,"" and social networks. Individual decisions depend on personal cognitions; hence we further clarify the impact of the Internet on individual behavior and decisions, such as fertility decisions, house purchasing decisions, and financial investment decisions. For enterprises, we consider Internet Big Data-assisted decision-making. Enterprises can make relevant business decisions such as targeted advertising, product improvement, and price discrimination by mining big data and using artificial intelligence algorithms. We find that internet technology can directly impact human intelligence (cognition) and influence individual decisions.

inproceedings,Adaptive Learning Based on AI with Predictive Algorithms,"Learning Analytics (LA) is an analysis toolset that enables collection of students' data and context data, for the purpose of visualizing indicators of performance that allow for improvements for learning and academic success. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest were used. These algorithms trained a model that could predict the academic success of college-level engineering students. Under an experimental model with 182 students, three instructors leading six groups of Physics II for engineering majors of the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) administered adaptive measures for one group each and not for the other of their groups (the control groups). Three forecasts were calculated considering structured academic information (numerical grades) and unstructured academic information (student ID pictures). Unstructured data from the facial photograph and numeric academic information from the first evaluation period were considered for the study. The results show a significant difference between the control and experimental groups of only one instructor, while the results of the other two instructors' control and experimental groups were consistent. One finding of this study is that, despite the prediction not being correct for each student, a general picture of the performance of the group was given.

inproceedings,Developing Industry-Relevant Higher Order Thinking Skills in Computing Students,"A 2016 survey commissioned by the British Higher Education Council revealed CS graduates had one of the highest unemployment rates. Industry sources attribute this to a growing gap between employer expectations and university curriculum. This gap primarily consists of soft skills and higher-order thinking skills, which include the ability to analyse, synthesise, evaluate, critique and design. Technical job advertisements increasingly specify higher order thinking skills as entry requirements for graduates.This paper presents the results of our work studying whether formative tasks can develop higher-order thinking skills. The formative tasks consisted of quizzes covering the first four levels of the Bloom's taxonomy. The higher-order thinking skills were measured based on the static and dynamic models students created for a real world problem, as part of the final exam. Our results reveal a strong correlation exists between application and analysis level quizzes and design activities needing higher-order thinking in the exam. Students repeating the quizzes several times also had better results than others in higher-order design skills. These results suggest that practising with well-constructed quizzes especially at the higher Bloom's level exercises the cognitive channels that help improve higher-order thinking skills.","Kalra, Shekhar and Thevathayan, Charles and Hamilton, Margaret","higher order thinking skills, computer science education, intelligent tutoring systems, employability",10.1145/3341525.3387381,2020,6

This article explores the general expression of the performance, motivation and anxiety of students in Chinese medicine undergraduates in second language learning (SLL). performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates in China, it is to analyze the attribution and relationship of above three aspects, and propose the method of using artificial intelligence to improve students’ learning motivation, reduce learning anxiety and improve learning ability. Methods: it is to select the undergraduate students (n = 300) in Jilin Province of China as the subjects. Use the Chinese version of the Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale under Internet technology, the Chinese Undergraduate English Learning Motivation Questionnaire, the self-made College Students’ English learning ability evaluation scale and the English Writing Scale were used for test. Results: SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates are in the middle level among all undergraduates in China, and their English writing ability is lower than the middle level; Analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences in gender (p&lt;0.01) and grade (p&lt;0.05); learning ability in grade has extremely significant difference (p&lt;0.01); female 's learning ability and writing ability were significantly higher than male's (p&lt;0.01);Demographic variables were not statistically correlated with SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety (p&gt;0.05); SLL anxiety had remarkable correlation with learning motivation (p&gt;0.05); learning anxiety was statistically correlated with learning ability (p&lt;0.01); learning motivation was negative correlative with learning ability (P&lt;0.01). Regression analysis showed that learning anxiety and motivation had 44.3% and 5.8% explanatory power to English learning ability respectively. Intervention experiment results showed that Internet learning system significantly improved the performance of the experimental group (P&lt;0.01), and the performance of the experimental group in listening, reading, writing and translation was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&lt;0.01). the effectiveness of Internet learning mode had remarkable negative relationship with students’ learning anxiety (P&lt;0.01), and was significantly positive with learning motivation and learning ability (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the data-driven theory, the empirical study of Internet learning system in English teaching is completed, which provides an important theoretical support for the current College English intelligent teaching in China, which also provides a strong argument for the “scaffolding function” of AI in language learning. At the same time, the research also puts forward innovative ways to improve the effect of College English teaching from the perspective of psychology: through second language learning with AI resources, the “challenging task” set by the intelligent learning system increases the intensity and difficulty of learning, thus arousing the “promoting anxiety” of second language learners, and further internalizing the external and instrumental motivation in depth in order to improve English learning ability.","Su, Zheqian and Liu, Miao and Song, Bailin and Lian, Shulin",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483015,2021,6

Based on social cognitive career theory, this study aims to explore the relationships among transformational leadership, self-efficacy, problem-based learning and student employability in higher education institutions (HEIs). In terms of analyzing a total sample of 619 undergraduates from 12 Taiwanese HEIs by using structural equation model (SEM), the results show that the influences of transformational leadership, self-efficacy, and problem-based learning on student employability are statistically positive significant, and problem-based learning and self-efficacy play key mediators between transformational leadership and student employability. Based on the findings, specific suggestions and managerial implications for HEIs, curriculum and instruction planning, and future research are provided.","Peng, Michael Yao-Ping and Sheng-Hwa, Tuan and Han-Yu, Wang","Self-efficacy, problem-based learning, transformational leadership, employability development, social cognitive career theory",10.1145/3206129.3239422,2018,5
inproceedings,Sectorial Analysis Impact on the Development of Credit Scoring Machine Learning Models,"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises play an essential role in the growth of the global economy. The access to credit for these companies allows them to fund the development of their activities. Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a potential tool to help financial and insurance institutions to assess Small and Medium-sized companies and thus, accelerate their activities. The economic sector in which companies operate is an essential factor when it comes to determining the risk of default. On the other hand, to introduce Artificial Intelligence in a highly regulated industry, the principal actors need to understand the behavior of the models. In this paper, we focus on the development of Artificial Intelligence-based models for different economic sectors Furthermore, we analyze the model behavior using SHapley Additive exPlanations. We compare both the performance and the explanations of the different economic sector models with the global model. Our study shows that there is a slight improvement in terms of performance when creating the different sectorial models.

inproceedings,Closing the AI Accountability Gap: Defining an End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing,"Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source.In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.","Raji, Inioluwa Deborah and Smart, Andrew and White, Rebecca N. and Mitchell, Margaret and Gebru, Timnit and Hutchinson, Ben and Smith-Loud, Jamila and Theron, Daniel and Barnes, Parker","accountability, algorithmic audits, responsible innovation, machine learning",10.1145/3351095.3372873,2020,12

Big data is characterized by volume, velocity, variety and veracity (""data in doubt""). As big data applications, many of the emerging event processing applications must process events that arrive from sources such as sensors and social media, which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. Consider, for example, the possibility of incomplete data streams and streams including inaccurate data. In this tutorial we classify the different types of uncertainty found in event processing applications and discuss the implications on event representation and reasoning.

article,Instilling Conscience about Bias and Fairness in Automated Decisions,"Automated decision-making that impacts human interests, rights, and lives, in particular different data mining and artificial intelligence-based techniques, have become an integral part of many high-stakes applications such as sentencing and bail decisions, credit approvals, hiring, and predictive policing. However, fairness concerns, such as discrimination based on race, age, sex, etc., primarily stemming from data and algorithmic bias, is one of the major and contemporary problems associated with automated decision-making. In a traditional Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning course, educators usually teach different automated decision-making techniques but largely with limited coverage on their ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and privacy. In this paper, we share our experience in building and incorporating a fairness module 1 in an existing undergraduate Data Mining course, within traditional content, and evaluate the outcome of the initiative. The module includes lectures and hands-on exercises, using state-of-the-art and open-source bias detection and mitigation software, on real-world datasets. The goal is to help instill the consciousness of fairness and bias at the very early stage of a potential future developer of automated decision-making software. The module is easily adaptable, and can be integrated into other relevant courses including introductory Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning courses.","Islam, Sheikh Rabiul and Russell, Ingrid and Eberle, William and Dicheva, Darina",No data,No data,2022,10

inproceedings,Study on Prediction of Legal Judgments Based on the CNN-BiGRU Model,"As the cases exploded, leading legal judgment prediction becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques in the legal field. The goal of legal judgment prediction is to predict the judgment results based on the facts information of a case. However, the classifier of the traditional method has poor accuracy performance and cost large computational time. The commonly used deep learning models are CNN and RNN. In this paper, CNN-BiGRU was established and analyzed, which combined the good extraction ability of CNN for local feature information and RNN for long-term dependencies information of the text. Compared with the CAIL 2018 dataset, the prediction accuracy of the charges, law articles and the terms of penalty are 94.8%, 93.6%, and 73.4%, respectively. Results showed that CNN-BiGRU has a higher prediction accuracy than CNN or RNN alone and a good training efficiency over baselines.

inproceedings,An Instrument for Measuring Teachers’ Trust in AI-Based Educational Technology,"Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners’ AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers’ attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers’ input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers’ trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech’s Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech’s Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers’ responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers’ survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers’ trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education.","Nazaretsky, Tanya and Cukurova, Mutlu and Alexandron, Giora","Teachers, K-12 Education, Human Factors, Blended Learning, AI, Trust",10.1145/3506860.3506866,2022,11

inproceedings,A Preliminary Study Using Academagogy to Uncover the Problems That Block Adult Online Learner Engagement,"Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the online learning experience.","Addanki, Kranthi and Holdsworth, Jason and Hardy, Dianna and Myers, Trina","Online learning, academagogy, Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) continuum, design-based research, adult learners, personalisation",10.1145/3511861.3511872,2022,10

inproceedings,"More Than ""If Time Allows"": The Role of Ethics in AI Education","Even as public pressure mounts for technology companies to consider societal impacts of products, industries and governments in the AI race are demanding technical talent. To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions.

inproceedings,Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System,"As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.","McIlroy-Young, Reid and Sen, Siddhartha and Kleinberg, Jon and Anderson, Ashton","human-ai collaboration, chess, action prediction",10.1145/3394486.3403219,2020,11

inproceedings,Learning Fair Representations for Recommendation: A Graph-Based Perspective,"As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user’s and each item’s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation.

AI application services based on natural language technology include mobile phone voice assistants, smart speakers, and humanoid robots. Although these different types of AI application services are given the important task of human-machine communication and service interface in the future AI society, the common point is that these smart speakers have the service function of dissemination. The application of AI is an important issue for the development of various types of industries in the next few years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research in this area in the previous literature. We also build some propose management of AI service implications for physical bookstores management based on the results of model analysis.","Wang, Shu-Mei and Huang, Yu-Kai and Wang, Chi-Cheng","smart speaker, technology acceptance models, planned behavioral theories, AI customer service",10.1145/3396743.3396791,2020,6

inproceedings,A Smart Chatbot Architecture Based NLP and Machine Learning for Health Care Assistance,"A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.","Ayanouz, Soufyane and Abdelhakim, Boudhir Anouar and Benhmed, Mohammed","conversational agents, Chatbots, artificial intelligence, natural language, modeling of conversations, neural machine translation",10.1145/3386723.3387897,2020,6

inproceedings,A Survey on Deep Learning and Machine Learning for COVID-19 Detection,"Coronaviruses are a type of virus that can cause a variety of disorders and exist in different types. COVID-19 is derived from a special type of a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, discovered in 2019. Approximately two years ago, COVID-19 was discovered in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and it has since become a worldwide source of concern. A COVID-19 confirmed patient is experiencing symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and a dry cough. Based on the results of laboratory tests and/or chest X-rays, the COVID-19 diagnosis is established. When it comes to research using chest CT scans /X-ray for the diagnosis of COVID-19, which is based on medical imaging, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches are increasingly being applied in a variety of ways. Machine learning and deep learning are fields of artificial intelligence that can be used to analyze the data that was acquired in order to better understand the origins of COVID-19. The outcomes of applying such an approach will aid in a better understanding of the nature of the threat and how it might be mitigated. For this reason, this work gives an overview of deep learning and machine learning approaches for the detection of COVID-19. Several COVID-19 detection methods are discussed in detail, as well as the issues, current challenges associated with artificial intelligence and medical researchers' approaches to providing a comprehensive assessment of detecting COVID-19.","M.

In this paper we demonstrate how student generated questions can result in unfolding of knowledge. We conducted field studies in Data Structures courses, where we provided a semi-structured question-posing situation to students. We analyzed the questions generated by students using inductive qualitative data analysis. We found that students pose exploratory questions and unfold knowledge using seven strategies, viz., Apply, Organize, Probe, Compare, Connect, Vary, and Implement. These strategies were validated within the data structures domain and were also found to be valid in another CS application domain (Artificial Intelligence).

inproceedings,Teaching Accessibility: A Design Exploration of Faculty Professional Development at Scale,"Most CS students learn little about accessibility in higher education; this is partly because most CS faculty know little about accessibility. Unfortunately, higher education CS faculty lack a model of professional development for learning to teach new topics. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of a ""micro"" professional development model for teaching accessibility in CS courses that could be used at scale. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S. CS faculty, asking them to explore a prototype of a web-based professional development tool that linked accessibility topics to CS topics. We found that many organizational factors limited faculty's autonomy to integrate accessibility in many of their courses. We also found that individual values and knowledge constrained faculty's ability and willingness to both learn and integrate accessibility topics into their courses. However, many faculty expressed desire to teach accessibility in their courses if they had access to even basic accessibility content and materials to use in their courses.","Kawas, Saba and Vonessen, Laura and Ko, Amy J.","professional development, higher education, accessibility",10.1145/3287324.3287399,2019,7

inproceedings,Using Business Intelligence to Support Strategic Sustainability Information Management,"The concept of sustainability has become an important phenomenon globally with many organisations being affected by the heightened awareness in sustainability. Organisations are more aware of the importance of promoting sustainability in all areas of operations. This is no different in the higher education sector, with a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) playing a leading role in promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability.This paper highlights the importance of effectively managing sustainability information and the challenges HEIs face in sustainability reporting. Business Intelligence (BI) is a solution to overcome the challenges and effectively managing sustainability information. However, HEIs need to overcome a number of challenges associated with BI to ensure a BI solution is correctly implemented and is effective in solving the problem of effective sustainability information management. This study focusses on the management of sustainability information in South African HEIs. The results indicate that there are many challenges to managing sustainability information in South African HEIs, including siloed data and information as well as poor sharing and communication of information. These two challenges can be overcome by a correctly implemented BI solution.","Haupt, Ross and Scholtz, Brenda and Calitz, Andre","Performance Dashboards, Business Intelligence, Sustainability",10.1145/2815782.2815795,2015,11
inproceedings,Artificial Moral Advisors: A New Perspective from Moral Psychology,"Philosophers have recently put forward the possibility of achieving moral enhancement through artificial intelligence (e.g., Giubilini and Savulescu's version [32]), proposing various forms of ""artificial moral advisor"" (AMA) to help people make moral decisions without the drawbacks of human cognitive limitations. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the AMA, drawing on empirical evidence from moral psychology to point out several challenges to these proposals that have been largely neglected by AI ethicists. In particular, we suggest that the AMA at its current conception is fundamentally misaligned with human moral psychology - it incorrectly assumes a static moral values framework underpinning the AMA's attunement to individual users, and people's reactions and subsequent (in)actions in response to the AMA suggestions will likely diverge substantially from expectations. As such, we note the necessity for a coherent understanding of human moral psychology in the future development of AMAs.","Liu, Yuxin and Moore, Adam and Webb, Jamie and Vallor, Shannon","ai moral enhancement, artificial moral advisor, moral psychology, normative ethics, ai ethics",10.1145/3514094.3534139,2022,10

As the backbone of students' ideological and political education, the team of college counselors is an important factor to ensure the continuous, healthy and rapid development of my country's higher education. The overall level and work status of the college counselor team will directly affect the effectiveness of ideological and political education and the realization of talent training goals. This article is based on the research of the university counselor incentive system based on intelligent computing. This article first uses the literature research method to analyze some problems in the incentive system of college counselors, and then proposes the necessity of reforming the incentive system for college counselors. Finally, it uses questionnaire surveys and quantitative analysis methods to analyze the work status of college counselors and how to deal with them. Research shows that the working conditions of college counselors are not very good. About 40% of counselors feel listless in their work, which may be related to the heavy workload. College counselors are dissatisfied with the incentive system, about 45% of them.

inproceedings,"Modular Experiential Learning for Secure, Safe, and Reliable AI: Curricular Initiative to Promote Education in Trustworthy AI","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to IT systems. However, AI can be manipulated to perform undesirably, exhibit biases or abusive behaviors. When AI algorithms are parallelized on high-performance computing-based cyberinfrastructure (CI), such misbehaviors and uncertainty can multiply to obscure the root causes. Secure, safe, and reliable computing techniques can mitigate these problems. The project described in this paper aims to inform curriculum and develop materials to educate students who use AI from the outset, so that they will first become aware of the issues and secondly practical considerations will be integrated with theory in classes. Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to rapidly upgrade the skills of current and future CI users, so they can apply new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be taken as standalone self-directed units or integrated into existing classes, starting with CS 1 and CS 2, which are taken by many non-CS STEM students. In a sandpit environment, learners take measured risks when guided on a journey of discovery. The primary purpose of this paper is to present key findings of the research following a 2-year pilot.

inproceedings,Securing the Human: A Review of Literature on Broadening Diversity in Cybersecurity Education,"Recent global demand for cybersecurity professionals is promising, with the U.S. job growth rate at 28%, three times the national average [1]. In a global survey, 2,300 security managers reported that 59% of their security positions were unfilled, although 82% anticipated cyberattacks to their systems [2]. At the same time, the cybersecurity field is broadening, not only in technical concepts but also in human factors, business processes, and international law. The field has not become culturally diversified, however. Professionals hired in 2018 included only 24.9% women, 12.3% African Americans, and 6.8% Latinos [3].

inproceedings,A Mixed Methods Investigation of Breadth and Intensity of Extracurricular Activity Participation and Students’ Academic Performance,"The relationship between extracurricular activity participation (EAP) and academic performance has been analyzed by sociologists, economists, and psychologists for decades. However, researchers have mainly directed their attention to general education students and seemingly ignored higher education undergraduates. This study aims to examine this relationship under other dimensions of EAP such as the breadth and the intensity on university students of a Vietnamese educational institution. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was utilized with two data collection instruments: a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The quantitative data in the first phase revealed no statistical significance between EAP and students’ academic performance (e.g., time on homework, lateness for school, skipping classes, and missing sessions) while the qualitative information in the second phase uncovered a very small effect size of EAP on those outcomes.","Thi Thanh Dang, Van","Academic performance (AP), Extracurricular activities (ECAs), Extracurricular activity participation (EAP)",10.1145/3498765.3498827,2022,7
inproceedings,A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Early Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Using MRI,"The continuous evolution of technology in Biomedicine has given satisfactory answers for several complex diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the major neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, belongs to this category. So far, no cure reverses or stops the biological changes that occur in the brains of patients; however, the early diagnosis and early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease is a crucial step in reducing the burden on both the patient and the caregivers. One of the predominant ways to deal with this difficulty is by integrating artificial intelligence and large-scale biomedical data. In this direction, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution data, which can be decrypted through artificial intelligence tools. In recent years, the research community has shifted to deep learning methods applied to medical images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In the present work, we propose a hybrid (called CNN-SVM) model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to predict the early AD stages from MRI. Our results showed that the proposed CNN-SVM model outperforms other well-known algorithms supporting the more effective AD diagnosis.","Papadaki, Eugenia and Exarchos, Themis and Vlamos, Panagiotis and Vrahatis, Aristidis","Convolutional Neural Networks, Alzheimer’s Disease, MRI",10.1145/3549737.3549779,2022,6

inproceedings,A Classification of How MOOCs Are Used for Blended Learning,"There are many different examples of where MOOCs have been integrated into teaching and learning in a higher education context. These approaches are typically called blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) and are not intended to replace traditional learning methods but rather to enhance them. Despite increasing interest in bMOOCs there have been few attempts to date to describe with breadth the different ways in which they have been integrated with formal teaching and learning, this means that there are few guides for practitioners, and that it is difficult for the research community to compare different examples. This paper proposes a hierarchy classification of how blended MOOCs are used by presenting a systematic literature review leading to an analysis of 20 different case studies, which is then validated by an independent expert review. The resulting classification model differentiates between Supplementary and Integrated bMOOCs, where Integrated can itself be broken down into models that focus on Content, Assessment, or Interaction. Our work shows that there are at least eight different models for using bMOOCs within formal teaching and learning, although most of the existing research focuses on the Flipped Classroom model (a sub-type of the Content model). Our work therefore reveals gaps in the current understanding of bMOOCs, and will also help to contextualize and scope future research and analysis.","Alghamdi, Taghreed and Hall, Wendy and Millard, David","Blended Learning, Blended MOOCs models, Higher Education, MOOCs",10.1145/3345094.3345107,2019,7

In artificial intelligence, the 2D image recognition of deep learning is relatively mature, but the 3D point cloud image is still in development. Because the data of 3D point cloud is larger than that of 2D image, and the scanning method is different, which affects the point cloud image to generate different data types. For various reasons, the development of 3D point clouds still requires us to make more efforts to study how to improve them. With the continuous expansion of the data size, the computing performance becomes more important, and in deep learning, the convolutional layer occupies a very important position. If the performance can be improved in the convolutional layer, it will definitely bring good benefits to artificial intelligence, so this paper will propose the use of efficient reuse, depthwise separable convolution, quantization, and Winograd algorithm to accelerate the operation and reduce the weight. Finally, according to the digital integrated circuit design process based on the standard cell library, the convolution layer operation in the neural network is realized.","Liao, Kuan-Yu and Xiao, You-Sheng and Fan, Yu-Cheng","Convolutional Neural Network, Winograd, 3D Point Cloud Segmentation, Depthwise Separable Convolution",10.1145/3556223.3556233,2022,5

inproceedings,Personal Learning Environments: Looking Back and Looking Forward,"In this paper I look back at the emergence of the idea of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and consider why they have failed to be widely adapted. I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits’ which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of ‘coping with finiteness’” and “seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity” as a response to the climate crisis. I suggest this could provide a point of reference for us to rethink Personal Learning Environment encompassing the ideas of equity and encompassing both radical pedagogies and the perspectives of previously marginalized interests and non-powerful groups.","Attwell, Graham","PLEs, equity in education, Personal Learning Environments, MOOCs, Open Education, agency in education",10.1145/3486011.3486504,2021,5

inproceedings,Understanding Modules At-Risk Within University Using a Context-Aware Business Intelligence Framework,"This paper, shows the authors' efforts to determine the riskiness of academic modules at a South African University. In determining the modules at risk, the authors used a hybrid of sequential and cyclical methodological approaches, based on a context-aware business intelligence framework. The risk indicators derived from academic module enrolment data elements, were weighted and aggregated to determine the riskiness of a module. The results showed that the riskiness of a module can be zero, weak, strong and extreme. Depending on the riskiness of a module, the institution can determine the appropriate intervention strategies for students to succeed in passing the module. This work proves to be essential for program and module reviews which are important quality assurance exercises within the South African higher education institutions.","Mutanga, Alfred and Kadyamatimba, Armstrong","Degree of Difficulty, Risk Modules, Business Intelligence, Content Knowledge",10.1145/3134383.3134387,2017,7

inproceedings,Exploration on Integrating Accessibility into an AI Course,"Understanding accessibility and how it relates to artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology is an imperative skill for computing students from both an ethical and employment standpoint. Unfortunately, AI courses do not typically cover accessibility. When teaching ethics in AI, discussions on bias and fairness cover user diversity in terms of gender and race, but not disability. To address the lack of teaching accessibility in AI courses, we conducted a pilot study to explore what and how accessibility topics can be integrated into an AI course, titled Natural Language Processing (NLP). We added to the NLP course some general and quick accessibility topics through means such as a short guest lecture, a programming assignment and a final project that connect accessibility and AI. We gathered student feedback through a pre-survey, a post-survey and interviews with five students. The course we looked at took place synchronously in an online setting using Zoom. In this context, we observed how implementing accessibility topics remotely into the course affected students in their knowledge of accessibility and disability.","Tseng, Chia-En and Jung, Seoung Ho and Elglaly, Yasmine N. and Liu, Yudong and Ludi, Stephanie","computing education, accessibility, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3478431.3499399,2022,7
inproceedings,Social Media Content Analytics beyond the Text: A Case Study of University Branding in Instagram,"Social media is unarguably one of the wealthiest sources of information. The opinions shared on social platform have an immense influence towards the brands equity. Social media has flourished with platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, etc. However, over the past decade, Instagram, one of the most famous photo posting social media, has dominated the youth's attention with its unique feature of being the first ever photo sharing application. Over the years, large-scale data of user activity has been collected by researchers, yet not a single research reflects the scope of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework to social media. By applying the advanced frameworks of AI, we can acquire the capability to analyze the content of social media. This content analysis enables us to be privy to numerous brands on social media, namely, retail branding, fashion branding, and, education branding, etc. In this paper, we propose a framework for education branding in social media. Our approach redefines social intelligence by helping students choose their school and provide insight on the rapid growth of the university through ranking, trending sports teams, newly introduced courses, real-time student feedback and future goals of the universities.

The device consists of four parts: sulfur hexafluoride gas chamber, solid insulator, defect simulator, observation and measurement device. The defect simulator can effectively simulate free metal particle discharge, tip discharge, suspension discharge and air gap discharge. A real-type integrated defect simulator based on GIS is developed, and the partial discharge signal is tested on the simulator, the change trend of decomposed gas with time is detected. Based on this, an artificial intelligence classification method combining fuzzy ISODATA algorithm and ant colony algorithm is proposed, and the structure parameters of the two algorithms are optimized by PSO algorithm. The field application results of HV combined electrical appliances show that the proposed method is effective. The fault type diagnosis method can effectively judge the fault mode intelligently according to time series of SF6 micro-decomposition gas and typical micro-decomposition gas. This paper not only collects the original classification data from the hardware platform of the defect simulator, but also develops an artificial intelligence classification algorithm software system which is easy to be programmed. It can be directly and effectively used to diagnose and evaluate the type of insulation defect in the field practical engineering of GIS.

Course through a Knowledge-Based Chatbot Workshop,"In this paper we share interim results of an ongoing mixed method evaluative study of 43 students enrolled in an elective course “Doing Business with A.I.” at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB), Singapore Management University. A key component of the course design is an experiential chatbot workshop that provides non-STEM students with an opportunity to acquire basic skills to build a chatbot prototype using the ‘Dialogflow’ program. The workshop and the experiential learning activity were designed to impart students with relevant knowledge and skills such as conversation and user-centric design know how and know why that are transferrable to other situational contexts beyond the course. Based on ongoing class surveys and qualitative interviews with students, we are trying to corroborate a conceptual model developed from learning theories and models related to technology mediated learning (TML) aimed at measuring the effects of a hands-on knowledge-based chatbot workshop designed by the authors on students’ engagement and motivation as drivers of acquiring AI-related competencies such as natural language processing skills (NLP). One important didactical aspect during the design and roll-out of the chatbot workshop is that novice learners with no or very little knowledge about A.I. recognize and create the important linkage between knowledge inputs and outputs of NLP-powered conversational agents (chatbots) so that user queries are effectively addressed. The knowledge-based chatbot workshop design as described in the paper provides useful practical information for instructors interested in designing educational chatbot prototypes for effective digital teaching and learning in a business school (higher education) context that can be transferred to other organizational units beyond the university (e.g. quality customer service) in order to make learners future-ready.","Menkhoff, Thomas and Lydia Teo, Ying Qian",Chatbots • Knowledge management • Student engagement,10.1145/3546157.3546175,2022,7

inproceedings,A Deep Knowledge Tracking Model Integrating Difficulty Factors,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence education, it is of great significance to establish a scientific and effective model of learners' knowledge mastery state. Knowledge tracking (KT) as a modeling method for learners to infer knowledge level based on their learning achievements, plays a key role in intelligent education system. There are some problems in the existing knowledge tracking models, such as incomplete input features and unstable model. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction of learners' learning effect, this paper proposes a deep knowledge tracking model (DDKT) based on the comprehensive difficulty of the topic. The model mainly includes two parts: on the one hand, the construction of the comprehensive difficulty model, on the other hand, the improvement of the model. The model combines topic difficulty with deep knowledge tracking model, enriches learners' learning process dimensions and improves the generalization ability of the model.

These automatically generated (AG) questions can be integrated with textbook content in a courseware environment so that students can practice as they read. Scaling this learn by doing method is a valuable pursuit, as it is proven to cause better learning outcomes (i.e., the doer effect). However, it is also necessary to ensure these AG questions perform equally as well as human-authored (HA) questions. In previous studies, it was found that AG and HA questions were essentially equivalent with respect to student engagement, difficulty, and persistence. While these question performance metrics expanded existing AQG research, this paper further extends this research by evaluating question discrimination using student data from a university Neuroscience course.

article,Championing HCI Education to CS Undergraduates at a Grassroots Level: A Case Study in Egypt,"There is an increasing global interest in developing inclusive technologies that contribute to the social welfare of people in emerging economies. Egypt, a country facing socio-economic challenges, has been investing in an increasingly growing ICT infrastructure and human capital. The current ICT workforce is technically-oriented due to the increasing interest in global outsourcing. However, there is a need for a Computer Science (CS) workforce that is willing to engage with the bottom-of-the-pyramid users as a potential market. CS students should harness interdisciplinary skills that enable them to sympathize with users who have diverse backgrounds, perceptions, and digital literacies. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education programs could provide the necessary skills for local CS students to fulfill this workforce gap. Like many Arab and African countries, Egyptian higher education programs and industry have been slow in recognizing the value of HCI.In this article, I address how introducing HCI education to students in an Egyptian engineering institute can benefit industry. I discuss a series of action research cycles focusing on the learning design of a student-centered introductory HCI short course that successfully sensitized students to the role of end-users in technology design.

inproceedings,The Role of Biased Data in Computerized Gender Discrimination,"Gender bias is prevalent in all walks of life from schools to colleges, corporate as well as government offices. This has led to the under-representation of the female gender in many professions. Most of the Artificial Intelligence-Natural Language Processing (AI-NLP) models learning from these underrepresented real world datasets amplify the bias in many cases, resulting in traditional biases being reinforced. In this paper, we have discussed how gender bias became ingrained in our society and how it results in the underrepresentation of the female gender in several fields such as education, healthcare, STEM, film industry, food industry, and sports. We shed some light on how traditional gender bias is reflected in AI-NLP systems such as automated resume screening, machine translation, text generation, etc. Future prospects of these AI-NLP applications need to include possible solutions to these existing biased AI-NLP applications, such as debiasing the word embeddings and having guidelines for more ethical and transparent standards.","Ahmed, Md.

inproceedings,Safe Reinforcement Learning in Simulated Environment of Self-Driving Laboratory,"Today we see tremendous potential in applying artificial intelligence (AI), deep reinforcement learning, and agent-based simulation to complex real-world problems. AI helps people support and automate decision-making penetrating almost all daily life aspects and research areas. One of the reasons for this potential is that AI helps us solve problems at a lower cost of resources and time. Materials research acceleration often relies upon AI using and automation of laboratory experiments, bringing significant fruitful results and advances. Self-driving laboratories include closed-loop chemistry experimentation and assist in designing new functional nanomaterials and optimizing their known parameters with AI and machine learning approaches. Due to the possibility of involving in the nanomaterials design process and some hazardous components, routine experimentation under chemists' continuous monitoring is usually required. Shifting to new intelligent technologies in self-driving laboratories with automated closed-loop experimentation requires excluding risks and accidents because of improper AI applications. This paper discusses safe deep reinforcement learning and its application in a simulated environment in self-driving laboratories experimenting with new functional materials. We proposed an approach to solving the problem of safe reinforcement learning by learning the intelligent agent to find a hidden reward and implemented that approach by constructing and using the heatmap from observation of the hidden reward neighborhood.","V.

inproceedings,Offline Teaching Method in Blended Teaching Mode of Improving the Innovation Ability of Students in IT Majors,"At present, all kinds of innovative applications of artificial intelligence, big data and other technologies in various industries and fields make the demands for the cultivation of innovative ability of IT talents more urgent. Aiming at the problem of insufficient cultivation of students' innovative ability in the existing blended teaching mode, this paper puts forward a theoretical teaching method based on four-stage and problem-oriented in the offline class, and a practical teaching method based on ""entrepreneurial thinking"". In the former teaching method, by dividing the explanation of a concrete theoretical knowledge into four stages: ""concept"", ""problem"", ""application"" and ""innovation"", and at the same time, designing some progressive problems in each stage to guide students to deepen their knowledge understanding and inspire their innovative thinking around the application and innovation of knowledge, and an example has been given to well illustrate the method. Meanwhile, in the latter teaching method, this paper also presents a practical teaching method based on ""entrepreneurial thinking"" to optimize the practical teaching links of the courses in IT major, in which the project-based teaching method and entrepreneurial thinking are adopted , and the practical process is divided into several stages as ""demand analysis and topic selection"", ""scheme design"", ""scheme implementation"" and ""application and promotion"", At each stage, some concrete guiding measures and examination and evaluation methods have been designed to effectively stimulate students' innovative thinking and innovative ability specific. Through the application of the above methods to the teaching practices in the ""computer network"" course, it is proved that this method plays a promoting role in the development of students' innovation and practical abilities.","Huang, Min and Yuan, Hua and Sun, Bo","Cultivation of innovation ability, offline teaching methods, IT major, blended teaching mode",10.1145/3535735.3535740,2022,5
inproceedings,Modular Reinforcement Learning Framework for Learners and Educators,"Reinforcement learning algorithms have been applied to many research areas in gaming and non-gaming applications. However, in gaming artificial intelligence (AI), existing reinforcement learning tools are aimed at experienced developers and not readily accessible to learners. The unpredictable nature of online learning is also a barrier for casual users. This paper proposes the EasyGameRL framework, a novel approach to the education of reinforcement learning in games using modular visual design patterns. The EasyGameRL framework and its software implementation in Unreal Engine are modular, reusable, and applicable to multiple game scenarios. The pattern-based approach allows users to effectively utilize reinforcement learning in their games and visualize the components of the process. This would be helpful to AI learners, educators, designers and casual users alike.","Versaw, Rachael and Schultz, Samantha and Lu, Kevin and Zhao, Richard","education, computer game, reinforcement learning, visual design, design pattern",10.1145/3472538.3472583,2021,5
inproceedings,Assumed Digital Literacy Knowledge by Australian Universities: Are Students Informed?,"As disruptive technologies make an impact in the workplace, employers are demanding a broader range of skills that go beyond the capabilities that graduates have developed through their higher education studies. Further, digital literacy is increasingly being recognised as an essential skill, on a par with literacy and numeracy, to support job readiness. As a result there is increasing pressure on universities to ensure their courses prepare graduates appropriately, but is digital literacy amongst these skills? The first step to address this question is to gain an understanding of what universities' expectations are of a student's assumed digital literacy knowledge, the foundation from which graduate digital capabilities are built. The aim of this study is to investigate what information Australian universities provide to prospective students to inform them of the expectations of assumed digital literacy knowledge when entering a course. Based on a sample of 13 Australian universities it seems that minimal information is being provided to new students. This study demonstrates that there is no shared understanding of what digital literacy entails, which poses challenges for students who are expected to have an ill-defined and in some instances, unknown set of digital skills. It also challenges relationships between staff and students, as expectations and understanding of digital skills are not aligned.","Coldwell-Neilson, Jo","higher education, Digital literacy, assumed knowledge",10.1145/3013499.3013505,2017,6

inproceedings,Correlations between Automated Rhetorical Analysis and Tutors' Grades on Student Essays,"When assessing student essays, educators look for the students' ability to present and pursue well-reasoned and strong arguments. Such scholarly argumentation is often articulated by rhetorical metadiscourse. Educators will be necessarily examining metadiscourse in students' writing as signals of the intellectual moves that make their reasoning visible. Therefore students and educators could benefit from available powerful automated textual analysis that is able to detect rhetorical metadiscourse. However, there is a need to validate such technologies in higher education contexts, since they were originally developed in non-educational applications. This paper describes an evaluation study of a particular language analysis tool, the Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP), on undergraduate social science student essays, using the mark awarded as a measure of the quality of the writing.

Academia has introduced computer game development in its curricula. In the case of the University of Cadiz, a non-compulsory course about ""Video Game Design"" is offered to Computer Science students. In the artificial intelligence lesson, students play a competition to earn part of their grade. Each student individually implements a strategy to play a predefined board-game. The different strategies compete in a software environment that implements it. Grading this part of the course depends on the results obtained in the competition. Additionally, before running the competition, students have to read the source code written by their classmates and bet a part of their grade on other teams' results. This way, they elaborate a critical analysis of the source code written by other programmers: a very valuable skill in the professional world. Students that are not so proficient in coding are still rewarded if they demonstrate they can do a good analysis of the source code written by others.","Palomo-Duarte, Manuel and Dodero, Juan Manuel and Tocino, Jos\'{e} Tom\'{a}s and Garc\'{\i}a-Dom\'{\i}nguez, Antonio and Balderas, Antonio","artificial intelligence, expert system programming, competition, video game development",10.1145/2325296.2325371,2012,6

While there is an increasing focus on designing tools and activities for teaching machine learning, most tools sidestep engaging with the complexity and trade-offs inherent in the design of ML models in favor of demonstrating the power and functionality of the technology. In this paper, we investigate how a design perspective can inform the design of educational tools and activities for teaching machine learning. Through a literature review, we identify 34 tools and activities for teaching ML, and using a design perspective on ML system development, we examine strengths and limitations in how they engage students in the complex design considerations linked to the different components of machine learners.

Explainable AI aims to make algorithmic decision-making more transparent to humans. As future vehicles become more intelligent and user-adaptive, explainability will play an important role ensuring that drivers understand the AI system's functionalities and outputs. However, when integrating explainability into in-vehicle features there is a lack of knowledge about user needs and requirements and how to address them. We conducted a study with 59 participants focusing on how end-users evaluate explainability in the context of user-adaptive comfort and infotainment features. Results show that explanations foster perceived understandability and transparency of the system, but that the need for explanation may vary between features. Additionally, we found that insufficiently designed explanations can decrease acceptance of the system.

inproceedings,"Artificial Societies in the Anthropocene: Challenges and Opportunities for Modeling Climate, Conflict, and Cooperation","Computational approaches to climate modeling have advanced rapidly in recent years, as have the tools and techniques associated with the construction of artificial life, artificial societies, and social simulation experiments. However, the use of computer simulation to study the effects of climate change on human conflict and cooperation is still relatively rare. In this article, we consider some of the challenges and opportunities that face interdisciplinary teams seeking to develop models that incorporate human, ecological, and natural systems. There is an urgency to this task because climate-abetted socio-economic and inter-cultural stress can trigger conflict at all scales, which exacerbates human suffering. We argue that the interdisciplinary community of scholars with expertise in multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation and artificial life modeling have a unique opportunity to collaborate and address these challenges by attempting to develop artificial societies capable of uncovering adaptive pathways that can minimize social conflict and maximize cooperation in the face of climate-abetted social and ecological change.","Shults, F.

inproceedings,A Field Study of Pedestrians and Autonomous Vehicles,"Autonomous vehicles have been in development for nearly thirty years and recently have begun to operate in real-world, uncontrolled settings. With such advances, more widespread research and evaluation of human interaction with autonomous vehicles (AV) is necessary. Here, we present an interview study of 32 pedestrians who have interacted with Uber AVs. Our findings are focused on understanding and trust of AVs, perceptions of AVs and artificial intelligence, and how the perception of a brand affects these constructs. We found an inherent relationship between favorable perceptions of technology and feelings of trust toward AVs. Trust in AVs was also influenced by a favorable interpretation of the company's brand and facilitated by knowledge about what AV technology is and how it might fit into everyday life. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to surface AV-related interview data from pedestrians in a natural, real-world setting.","Reig, Samantha and Norman, Selena and Morales, Cecilia G. and Das, Samadrita and Steinfeld, Aaron and Forlizzi, Jodi","Autonomous vehicles, field study, human-vehicle interaction, trust",10.1145/3239060.3239064,2018,12
inproceedings,Efficient Data Processing Method for Edge Intelligence Based on SVM,"Recently, edge intelligence is emerging. It is widely used because it allows you to make business models more efficient through edge intelligence, but there is still a lack of models to use for edge intelligence. Artificial neural networks are being used a lot because they solve the problem of overfitting, which is a disadvantage of artificial neural networks and increase the speed by improving GPU performance. However as the independent variable to be learned increases, the learning time and characteristics of the artificial neural network slow down and the size of the neural network becomes very heavier. The shortage of these artificial neural networks make it difficult to make edge intelligence for classification or prediction in real life. Manufacturing lightweight models using heavy neural networks and high-performance GPUs also presents a lot of financial problems. However, SVM based on statistical mathematics exists between machine learning. Although it is relatively inferior to artificial intelligence, it is better light and has stable performing. To do this, we propose an efficient data processing method that improves the characteristics of the SVM (the overall performance, accuracy and learning speed of the SVM) and makes it easier for the SVM to learn the data. When four types of data processing were applied, the accuracy increased by more than 0.4% for the iris data set and 2% on average for the other data sets, and the training time for all data sets was also reduced. As a result, SVMs that can process data efficiently are much lighter than artificial neural networks and have very good training times versus accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient data processing method based on SVM for edge intelligence.","Jung, Namgyu and Yoon, Junho and Mutombo, Kazadi Vially and Lee, Seungyeon and Lee, Jusuk and Choi, Chang","Multicollinearity, Data preprocessing, Edge intelligence, Variance Inflation factor, Standard Scaler, Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest",10.1145/3440943.3444728,2021,6
inproceedings,South Korean Public Value Coproduction Towards‘AI for Humanity’: A Synergy of Sociocultural Norms and Multistakeholder Deliberation in Bridging the Design and Implementation of National AI Ethics Guidelines,"As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.","Ha, You Jeen","Deliberative democracy, 4IR, Sociocultural norms, Public value, Artificial intelligence, Networked governance, AI policy, National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, South Korea, AI ethics, Multistakeholder",10.1145/3531146.3533091,2022,11

inproceedings,Towards a Game-Independent Model and Data-Structures in Digital Board Games: An Overview of the State-of-the-Art,"The increasing number of options of digital board games is exciting not only from an entertainment perspective but also from an academic prospect. It enables, for example, the application of modern computational techniques and algorithms for extracting and analyzing data from a variety of games - which range from classics like Chess and Go to modern board games with complex rules like Settlers of Catan and Terra Mystica. It is intuitive that different digital board games require distinct representation schemes and data structures to save, for example, the status or snapshot of a particular game at a specific moment. The choice for a representation model and data-structures is a crucial design decision that affects the selection of an algorithmic solution as well as the suitableness for artificial intelligence agents. This survey focuses on the different schemes and data structures used to represent game states, physical components, players, actions and rules for digital board games that have been reported in the academic literature. This study aims to lay the groundwork for the development of a game-independent computational framework which includes a generic game representation to facilitate and promote the application of computational techniques such as, for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning to this domain.","de Araujo, Luiz Jonata Pires and Charikova, Mariia and Sales, Juliano Efson and Smirnov, Vladislav and Thapaliya, Ananga","game states, board games, knowledge representation, data structures",10.1145/3337722.3342238,2019,8

Story completion as a method elicits participants' visions of possible futures, unconstrained by their understanding of current technological capabilities, but still reflective of current sociocultural values. Through a thematic analysis, we find these stories reveal the extremes of the capabilities and concerns of today's voice assistants---and artificial intelligence---such as improving efficiency and offering instantaneous support, but also replacing human jobs, eroding human agency, and causing harm through malfunction. We conclude by discussing how these speculative visions might inform and inspire the design of voice assistants and other artificial intelligence.","Cambre, Julia and Reig, Samantha and Kravitz, Queenie and Kulkarni, Chinmay","voice assistant, speculative design, conversational user interface, story completion, cui",10.1145/3357236.3395479,2020,14

article,Viewpoint: AI as Author – Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Literary Theory,"Anticipating the rise in Artificial Intelligence’s ability to produce original works of literature, this study suggests that literariness, or that which constitutes a text as literary, is understudied in relation to text generation. From a computational perspective, literature is particularly challenging because it typically employs figurative and ambiguous language. Literary expertise would be beneficial to understanding how meaning and emotion are conveyed in this art form but is often overlooked. We propose placing experts from two dissimilar disciplines – machine learning and literary studies – in conversation to improve the quality of AI writing. Concentrating on evaluation as a vital stage in the text generation process, the study demonstrates that benefit could be derived from literary theoretical perspectives. This knowledge would improve algorithm design and enable a deeper understanding of how AI learns and generates.

inproceedings,"A Scenario-Based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics","Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.","Li, Xiaotian Vivian and Rosson, Mary Beth and Robert, Jenay","learning analytics, higher education, privacy, scenarios, adoption, instructors, survey, design",10.1145/3491140.3528271,2022,12

inproceedings,Reusable Components for Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games,"While component reuse is a common concept in software engineering, it does not yet have a strong foothold in Computer Game development, in particular the development of computer-controlled game characters. In this work, we take a modular Statechart-based game AI modelling approach and develop a reuse strategy to enable fast development of new AIs. This is aided through the creation of a standardized interface for Statechart modules in a layered architecture. Reuse is enabled at a high-level through functional groups that encapsulate behaviour.These concepts are solidified with the development of the SkyAI tool. SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal.","Dragert, Christopher and Kienzle, J\""{o}rg and Verbrugge, Clark","statecharts, reuse, computer games, AI",No data,2012,7

inproceedings,Evaluation of StarCraft Artificial Intelligence Competition Bots by Experienced Human Players,"StarCraft is one of the most successful real-time strategy (RTS) games and is also actively being researched by artificial intelligence (AI) communities. Since 2010, game AI researchers have hosted annual AI competition events to develop human-level RTS AIs using StarCraft. It ranks the AI bots by their winning ratio from thousands of AI vs. AI matches without human involvement. It is questionable whether successful AI bots are also competitive and preferable to human players. In this study, we invited 20 experienced players with varying expertise to evaluate skill levels, overall performance and human likeness of AI bots. Results show that human's ranking of AI bots are not identical to the current one from AI competitions. It suggests the need for developing new AI competitions that consider human factors (""human-likeness"" or ""adaptation""). Also, it revealed that the expertise levels of human players have high impact on overall performance and human-likeness evaluations of AI bots. It supports the concept of dynamically adjusting AI bots to satisfy different levels of human players. The outcomes of this study will also be useful to incorporate human factors in other active video AI competitions (e.g., Angry Birds, Fighting Game, and General Game Playing).","Kim, Man-Je and Kim, Kyung-Joong and Kim, SeungJun and Dey, Anind K.","AI bots, turing test, AI competitions, real-time strategy games",10.1145/2851581.2892305,2016,7

However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.","Tena-Gago, David and Wang, Qi and Alcaraz-Calero, Jose M.","AI, Camera-based detection, Perception, ADAS",10.1145/3568160.3570232,2022,8
article,Performance-Driven X-Architecture Routing Algorithm&nbsp;for Artificial Intelligence Chip Design in Smart Manufacturing,"The new 7-nm Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip is an important milestone recently announced by the IBM research team, with a very important optimization goal of performance. This chip technology can be extended to various business scenarios in the Internet of Things. As the basic model for very large scale integration routing, the Steiner minimal tree can be used in various practical problems, such as wirelength optimization and timing closure. Further considering the X-architecture and the routing resources within obstacles, an effective performance-driven X-architecture routing algorithm for AI chip design in smart manufacturing is proposed to improve the delay performance of the chip. First, a special particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the discrete length-restricted X-architecture Steiner minimum tree problem in combination with genetic operations, and a particle encoding scheme is presented to encode each particle into an initial routing tree. Second, two lookup tables based on pins and obstacles are established to provide a fast information query for the whole algorithm flow. Third, a strategy of candidate point selection is designed to make the particles satisfy the constraints. Finally, a refinement strategy is implemented to further improve the quality of the final routing tree. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a better total wirelength, which is an important index of performance, thus better satisfying the demand for delay performance of AI chip design in smart manufacturing.","Liu, Genggeng and Zhu, Yuhan and Xu, Saijuan and Tang, Hao and Chen, Yeh-Cheng","X-architecture routing, Steiner minimal tree, refinement strategy, particle swarm optimization, resource relaxation, Artificial intelligence chip design, smart manufacturing",10.1145/3519422,2022,20

Across the two experiments, we manipulated three factors: (i) agent type (AI-driven robot vs. human agent), (ii) behavior type (intentional creation of a painting vs. accidental creation), and (iii) object type (abstract vs. representational painting). We found that people judge robot paintings and human paintings as art to roughly the same extent. However, people are much less willing to consider robots as artists than humans, which is partially explained by the fact that they are less disposed to attribute artistic intentions to robots.","Mikalonytundefined, Elzundefined Sigutundefined and Kneer, Markus","Artificial intelligence, mental states, creativity, AI art, aesthetics",10.1145/3530875,2022,19

However, despite the invention of new technologies useful in each step of the process, their integration still appears limited and their potential is still little exploited. Here, the authors link all the available technologies to every step of the financial accounting cycle, envisaging the use of a cloud platform on which to build a solid integrated system. Although integration is far from easy (it is no coincidence that it has not happened yet) this model takes into account all the practical needs of the stakeholders involved in the process: accountants, chartered accountants, auditors, governments, public and fiscal authorities, shareholders, creditors, data analysts. This novel approach can seriously offer a breakthrough to accounting and finance big data management [2][3].

inproceedings,Analysis on the Level of Higher Universities in Different Countries Using Entropy Weight Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process,"The higher education system is an important factor in measuring the education level and national strength of a country. A healthy and sustainable higher education system can effectively improve the country's competitiveness. The establishment of a complete and unified model for evaluating the pros and cons of the national higher education system is the basis for improving the level of the higher education system. In this article, we will build the relevant model in four steps. The first step is to search for documents and data, and use data on factors such as knowledge protection in multiple countries, higher education enrollment rates, education system quality, student Internet access, government education expenditures, the number of citations per paper, and the value of degrees. Build a model based on it. And standardize all data. In the second step, since the factors may have a certain correlation, the principal component analysis method is used to convert the equi-related variables into another set of unrelated variables and establish a model. The third step is to analyze the health and sustainability levels of higher education systems in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries based on this model, and obtain rankings and comprehensive scores. The fourth step is to use the entropy method to calculate the specific weight of each factor. Select one of the countries to reform the most weighted factor.

article,Teaching Machine Learning in K–12 Classroom: Pedagogical and Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education,"Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.","Tedre, Matti and Toivonen, Tapani and Kahila, Juho and Vartiainen, Henriikka and Valtonen, Teemu and Jormanainen, Ilkka and Pears, Arnold",,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962,2021,15

inproceedings,Improving Equity and Access to Higher Education Using Artificial Intelligence,"With data on education becoming more available, it has created a strong link between big data and learning analytics. This link paved the way for researchers in these fields to address several issues within higher education. In this study, we address the inequity in higher education, which is a long standing issue, that is depriving many skilled people of the fundamental right of education due to their background, gender, race, ethnicity or social class. Research has shown that deprived groups in terms of their demographics are more likely to fail. In this regard, we propose to use a deep neural network (DNN) that aims to predict students’ final results. This prior knowledge of students’ outcome could be used in favor of underprivileged groups in order to assist and enhance their chances to be successful. The conceived DNN consists of a binary classifier that is trained on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, with the aim to classify students into two categories: fail or pass, given a specific module and based on their demographics and interaction with the virtual learning environment. The obtained results are promising and show that deep learning could be an effective tool to promote equity in higher education. Moreover, they reveal that this latter is also a powerful tool for exploring big data within learning analytics, provided that deep neural networks become more accurate when they are provided with additional data.","Cheddadi, Saoussen and Bouache, Mourad",,10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569548,2021,6

This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.","Gomathi, R D and Maheswaran, S and Sathesh, S and Murugesan, G and Duraisamy, Prakash and Nandita, S and Karthik, R P",,10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984278,2022,7

inproceedings,OJ Intelligent Training System based on Artificial Intelligence for Hierarchical Personalized Teaching,"This paper introduces a new feature of the OJ system at Donghua University: intelligent training. Compared to other OJ systems, our OJ has the following features: 1) A clustering algorithm is used to classify the problems. When a student completes a category of problems, he or she passes a level and is awarded the corresponding score. 2) The system intelligently determines whether a student can pass the level or not. Generally, students with higher abilities need to complete fewer problems but receive higher scores. 3) The system uses a classification algorithm to determine whether plagiarism has occurred based on the code submitted by the student and the behavioral characteristics of the student at the time of submission, thus preventing plagiarism as much as possible. 4) The system uses a BP neural network to predict students' final exam scores, and then uses that predicted value as a point for reflecting ability to enhance students' sense of achievement in completing the practices. The OJ intelligent training model, based on the above features, allows students to train themselves at different levels according to their ability. Weaker students can practice more at lower levels to strengthen their foundation, while stronger students can practice more at higher levels to compete in competitions. This achieves the goal of personalized teaching at different levels and achieves better teaching results.","Huang, Qiubo and Liu, Zixuan and Lu, Ting",,10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00044,2021,6

article,"Navigating the Ethical Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Higher
Education: An Analysis of Seven Global AI Ethics Policies","AI use in higher education raises ethical concerns that must be
addressed. Biased algorithms pose a significant threat, especially if
used in admission or grading processes, as they could have devastating
effects on students. Another issue is the displacement of human
educators by AI systems, and there are concerns about transparency and
accountability as AI becomes more integrated into decision-making
processes. This paper examined three AI objectives related higher
education: biased algorithms, AI and decision-making, and human
displacement. Discourse analysis of seven AI ethics policies was
conducted, including those from UNESCO, China, the European Commission,
Google, MIT, Sanford HAI, and Carnegie Mellon. The findings indicate
that stakeholders must work together to address these challenges and
ensure responsible AI deployment in higher education while maximizing
its benefits. Fair use and protecting individuals, especially those with
vulnerable characteristics, are crucial. Gender bias must be avoided in
algorithm development, learning data sets, and AI decision-making. Data
collection, labeling, and algorithm documentation must be of the highest
quality to ensure traceability and openness. Universities must study the
ethical, social, and policy implications of AI to ensure responsible
development and deployment. The AI ethics policies stress responsible AI
development and deployment, with a focus on transparency and
accountability. Making AI systems more transparent and answerable may
reduce the adverse effects of displacement. In conclusion, AI must be
considered ethically in higher education, and stakeholders must ensure
that AI is used responsibly, fairly, and in a way that maximizes its
benefits while minimizing its risks.","Slimi, Zouhaier and Carballido, Beatriz Villarejo","\&nbsp; Artificial intelligence (AI); higher education; biased

article,ChatGPT in medical imaging higher education,"Introduction: Academic integrity among radiographers and nuclear

intelligence (AI). The recent release of ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by
GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to
questions in real-time, has redefined the boundaries of academic and
scientific writing. These boundaries require objective evaluation.
Method: ChatGPT was tested against six subjects across the first three
years of the medical radiation science undergraduate course for both
exams (n = 6) and written assignment tasks (n = 3). ChatGPT submissions
were marked against standardised rubrics and results compared to student
cohorts. Submissions were also evaluated by Turnitin for similarity and
AI scores.Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 performed below the
average student performance in all written tasks with an increasing
disparity as subjects advanced. ChatGPT performed better than the
average student in foundation or general subject examinations where
shallow responses meet learning outcomes. For discipline specific
subjects, ChatGPT lacked the depth, breadth, and currency of insight to
provide pass level answers.Conclusion: ChatGPT simultaneously poses a
risk to academic integrity in writing and assessment while affording a
tool for enhanced learning environments. These risks and benefits are
likely to be restricted to learning outcomes of lower taxonomies. Both
risks and benefits are likely to be constrained by higher order
taxonomies. Implications for practice: ChatGPT powered by GPT3.5 has
limited capacity to support student cheating, introduces errors and
fabricated information, and is readily identified by software as AI
generated. Lack of depth of insight and appropriateness for professional

article,"Factors Affecting the Adoption of AI-Based Applications in Higher
Education: An Analysis of Teachers' Perspectives Using Structural
Equation Modeling","Owing to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies, there has been increasing concern about how to promote the
use of AI technologies in school settings to enhance students' learning
performance. Teachers' intention to adopt AI tools in their classes
plays a crucial role in this regard. Therefore, it is important to
explore factors affecting teachers' intention to incorporate AI
technologies or applications into course designs in higher education. In
this study, a structural equation modeling approach was employed to
investigate teachers' continuance intention to teach with AI. In the
proposed model, 10 hypotheses regarding anxiety (AN), self-efficacy
(SE), attitude towards Al (ATU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and
perceived usefulness (PU) were tested, and this study explored how these
factors worked together to influence teachers' continuance intention. A
total of 311 teachers in higher education participated in the study.
Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the five
endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 70.4\% of the
changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of
BI. The total effect of ATU was 0.793, followed by SE, with a total
effect of 0.554. As a result, the intentions of teachers to learn to use
AI-based applications in their teaching can be predicted by ATU, SE,
PEU, PU and AN. Among them, teachers' SE positively influenced teachers'
PEU and ATU towards adopting AI-based applications, and also influenced
PU through PEU. In addition, the relationship between teachers' SE and
AN was negatively correlated, which indicated that enhancing teachers'
SE could reduce their AN towards using AI-based applications in their
teaching. Accordingly, implications and suggestions for researchers and
school teachers are provided.","Wang, Youmei and Liu, Chenchen and Tu, Yun-Fang","Artificial intelligence; Higher education; Anxiety; Self-efficacy;

important role in healthcare and health professions education. This
study explored medical students' and interns' knowledge of artificial

preferences around the teaching of AI competencies.Methods: In this
cross-sectional study, the authors used a previously validated Canadian
questionnaire and gathered responses from students and interns at KIST
Medical College, Nepal. Face validity and reliability of the tool were
assessed by administering the questionnaire to 20 alumni as a pilot
sample (Cronbach alpha = 0.6). Survey results were analyzed
quantitatively (p-value = 0.05).Results: In total 216 students (37\%

article,"Complexity at Mesoscales: A Common Challenge in Developing Artificial
Intelligence","Exploring the physical mechanisms of complex systems and making
effective use of them are the keys to dealing with the complexity of the

systematic review","Background: Human society has entered the age of artificial
intelligence, medical practice and medical education are undergoing
profound changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now applied in many
industries, particularly in healthcare and medical education, where it
deeply intersects. The purpose of this paper is to overview the current
situation and problems of ``AI+medicine/medical{''} education and to
provide our own perspective on the current predicament. Methods: We
searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and CNKI databases to assess the
literature on AI+medical/medical education from 2017 to July 2022. The
main inclusion criteria include literature describing the current
situation or predicament of ``AI+medical/medical education{''}. Results:
Studies have shown that the current application of AI in medical
education is focused on clinical specialty training and continuing
education, with the main application areas being radiology, diagnostics,
surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. The main role is to assist
physicians to improve their efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the
field of combining AI with medicine/medical education is steadily
expanding, and the most urgent need is for policy makers, experts in the
medical field, AI and education, and experts in other fields to come
together to reach consensus on ethical issues and develop regulatory
standards. Our study also found that most medical students are positive
about adding AI-related courses to the existing medical curriculum.
Finally, the quality of research on ``AI+medical/medical education{''}
is poor. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, our study
provides an innovative systematic review of the latest
``AI+medicine/medical curriculum{''}. Since the AI+medicine curriculum
is not yet regulated, we have made some suggestions.","Sun, Li and Yin, Changhao and Xu, Qiuling and Zhao, Weina",Artificial intelligence; healthcare; medical education; review,No data,2023,9

alert to unforeseen AI impact especially when it crosses over Islamic
ethical or legal limits. These interpretations should provide an

professional views on AI related issues. Using a quantitative
methodology approach with a cross-sectional study design, 37 experts
responded to the personal, online questionnaire emailed to them. The
findings generally indicate the respondents' insensitivity towards the
greater extent of AI impact on Muslim consumers at large. However, most
of the respondents were agreeable on the urgent need for regulations so
that AI is geared and harvested for its benefits in enhancing Muslim

Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease","BACKGROUND: Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) can be integrated
within standard clinical software to facilitate the acceptance of the
diagnostic findings during clinical interpretation.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop and evaluate a novel, general
purpose, explainable deep learning model (coronary artery disease-deep
learning {[}CAD-DL]) for the detection of obstructive CAD following
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion
imaging (MPI).
METHODS: A total of 3,578 patients with suspected CAD undergoing SPECT
MPI and invasive coronary angiography within a 6-month interval from 9
centers were studied. CAD-DL computes the probability of obstructive CAD
from stress myocardial perfusion, wall motion, and wall thickening maps,
as well as left ventricular volumes, age, and sex. Myocardial regions
contributing to the CAD-DL prediction are highlighted to explain the
findings to the physician. A clinical prototype was integrated using a
standard clinical workstation. Diagnostic performance by CAD-DL was
compared to automated quantitative total perfusion deficit (TPD) and
reader diagnosis.
RESULTS: In total, 2,247 patients (63\%) had obstructive CAD. In 10-fold
repeated testing, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve (AUC) (95\% CI) was higher according to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.83 {[}95\%
CI: 0.82-0.85]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.78 {[}95\% CI: 0.77-0.80]) or
reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.71 {[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.72]; P < 0.0001 for
both). In external testing, the AUC in 555 patients was higher according
to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.80 {[}95\% CI: 0.76-0.84]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.73
{[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.77]) or reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.65 {[}95\% CI:
0.61-0.69]; P < 0.001 for all). The present model can be integrated
within standard clinical software and generates results rapidly (<12
seconds on a standard clinical workstation) and therefore could readily
be incorporated into a typical clinical workflow.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep-learning model significantly surpasses the
diagnostic accuracy of standard quantitative analysis and clinical
visual reading for MPI. Explainable artificial intelligence can be
integrated within standard clinical software to facilitate acceptance of
artificial intelligence diagnosis of CAD following MPI. (C) 2022 by the

Curricula: Preparing Future Radiologists for the Artificial Intelligence
Era","Objective: Although educating radiology trainees about artificial
intelligence (AI) has become increasingly emphasized, the types of AI
educational curricula are not well understood. We performed a systematic
review of original studies describing curricula used to teach AI
concepts and practical applications for radiology residents and fellows.
Materials and methods: We performed a PubMed search for original studies
published as of July 22, 2022, describing AI curricula geared toward
radiology residents or fellows. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were
evaluated for curricula design, implementation details, and outcomes.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize these curricula. Results:
Five studies were included describing an AI curriculum, all geared
toward radiology residents. All five curricula were led by radiologists,
mostly by individual academic radiology departments (4; 80\%) with one
led by the ACR Resident and Fellow Section. Curricula design included
didactic sessions (5; 100\%), assigned readings (4; 80\%), hands-on
learning (3; 60\%), and journal clubs (3; 60\%); only one had
individualized learning plans. All four studies that evaluated the
impact of the curricula on participants' knowledge or attitudes showed
positive effects. Discussion: Amid increasing recognition of the
importance of AI education for radiologists-in-training, several AI
curricula for radiology residents have been implemented. Although
curricula designs varied and it is unclear if one type is superior, they
have had a positive impact on residents' knowledge and attitudes toward
AI. As AI becomes increasingly adopted in radiology, these curricula
serve as models for other departments and programs to develop AI
educational initiatives to prepare the next generation of radiologists

a Single Radiology Residency Training Program","Purpose: Advances in artificial intelligence applied to diagnostic
radiology are predicted to have a major impact on this medical
specialty. With the goal of establishing a baseline upon which to build
educational activities on this topic, a survey was conducted among
trainees and attending radiologists at a single residency program.
Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed. Comparisons of
categorical data between groups (trainees and attending radiologists)
were made using Pearson chi(2) analysis or an exact analysis when
required. Comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when
the data were not normally distributed. An alpha level of 0.05 was used.
Results: The overall response rate was 66\% (69 of 104). Thirty-six
percent of participants (n = 25) reported not having read a scientific
medical article on the topic of artificial intelligence during the past
12 months. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (n = 12) reported using
artificial intelligence tools during their daily work. Trainees were
more likely to express doubts on whether they would have pursued
diagnostic radiology as a career had they known of the potential impact
artificial intelligence is predicted to have on the specialty (P =
.0254) and were also more likely to plan to learn about the topic (P =
.0401).
Conclusions: Radiologists lack exposure to current scientific medical
articles on artificial intelligence. Trainees are concerned by the
implications artificial intelligence may have on their jobs and desire
to learn about the topic. There is a need to develop educational
resources to help radiologists assume an active role in guiding and
facilitating the development and implementation of artificial

to analyze teachers' data. Our analysis showed that AI offers teachers
several opportunities for improved planning (e.g., by defining students'
needs and familiarizing teachers with such needs), implementation (e.g.,
through immediate feedback and teacher intervention), and assessment
(e.g., through automated essay scoring) of their teaching. We also found
that teachers have various roles in the development of AI technology.
These roles include acting as models for training AI algorithms and
participating in AI development by checking the accuracy of AI automated
assessment systems. Our findings further underlined several challenges
in AI implementation in teaching practice, which provide guidelines for
developing the field.","Celik, Ismail and Dindar, Muhterem and Muukkonen, Hanni and Jarvela,

article,Artificial intelligence: Implications for the future of work,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with
roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory,
neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The
modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College
in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning
(ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites,
goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition,
sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support
systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life,
AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic
and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose
technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity,
electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the
workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety
and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML
methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like
sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent
DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use
of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and
management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in
strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift
occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a
proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for

article,"Assessment of learning curves on a simulated neurosurgical task using
metrics selected by artificial intelligence","OBJECTIVE Understanding the variation of learning curves of experts and
trainees for a given surgical procedure is important in implementing
formative learning paradigms to accelerate mastery. The study objectives
were to use artificial intelligence (AI)-derived metrics to determine
the learning curves of participants in 4 groups with different expertise
levels who performed a series of identical virtual reality (VR) subpial
resection tasks and to identify learning curve differences among the 4
groups.
METHODS A total of 50 individuals participated, 14 neurosurgeons, 4
neurosurgical fellows and 10 senior residents (seniors), 10 junior
residents (juniors), and 12 medical students. All participants performed
5 repetitions of a subpial tumor resection on the NeuroVR (CAE
Healthcare) platform, and 6 a priori-derived metrics selected using the
K-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm were used to assess
participant learning curves. Group learning curves were plotted over the
5 trials for each metric. A mixed, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed
between the first and fifth trial. For significant interactions (p <
0.05), post hoc Tukey's HSD analysis was conducted to determine the
location of the significance.
RESULTS Overall, 5 of the 6 metrics assessed had a significant
interaction (p < 0.05). The 4 groups, neurosurgeons, seniors, juniors,
and medical students, showed an improvement between the first and fifth
trial on at least one of the 6 metrics evaluated.

wearable technologies. Several IoT devices are used in educational
institutions, smart homes, and security management. Their widespread use
in sports training applications using IoT (WS-IoT)-based wearable
sensors is noteworthy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has
evolved rapidly, and its applications have expanded across many diverse
fields. Over the past few years, China has placed greater emphasis on
physical education to enhance students' physical fitness and overall
capabilities. A significant number of colleges and universities have
adopted artificial intelligence to transform traditional single-mode
sports training methods. This paper introduces a continuous monitoring
system for sports individuals using the WS-IoT. The goal of coaches is
to maximize the results of athlete training across various sports events
using AI technology and their sports expertise. In this study, we
examine the use of AI technology in sports and assess the practical
implications of its implementation. To achieve the objective function,
we used a Bayesian deep classifier and deep learning algorithms that

article,Artificial Intelligence in Service,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by
performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet
threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to
address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four
intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical,
intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide
between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is
developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding
analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly
preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job
replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job
level, and for ``lower{''} (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI
first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as
augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when
it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of
AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in
predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the
intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our
theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes
over more analytical tasks, giving the ``softer{''} intuitive and
empathetic skills even more importance for service employees.
Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and
empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine
integration for providing service but also results in a fundamental
threat for human employment.","Huang, Ming-Hui and Rust, Roland T.","artificial intelligence; human intelligence; machine learning;

the field of ML and heart transplantation. Methods A systematic database
search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of ML
and/or AI in heart transplantation in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane
database, and Google Scholar, from inception to November 2021. Results
Our search yielded 237 articles, of which 13 studies were included in
this review, featuring 463 850 patients. Three main areas of application
were identified: (1) ML for predictive modeling of heart transplantation
mortality outcomes; (2) ML in graft failure outcomes; (3) ML to aid
imaging in heart transplantation. The results of the included studies
suggest that AI and ML are more accurate in predicting graft failure and
mortality than traditional scoring systems and conventional regression
analysis. Major predictors of graft failure and mortality identified in
ML models were: length of hospital stay, immunosuppressive regimen,
recipient's age, congenital heart disease, and organ ischemia time.
Other potential benefits include analyzing initial lab investigations
and imaging, assisting a patient with medication adherence, and creating
positive behavioral changes to minimize further cardiovascular risk.

absence of activity from governments in the Australasian region up to
2019. The clinical radiology and radiation oncology sectors were
considered ripe for the adoption of AI, and this raised a range of
concerns about how to ensure the ethical application of AI and to guide
its safe and appropriate use in our two specialties. Methods RANZCR's
Artificial Intelligence Committee undertook a landscape review in 2019
anddetermined that AI within clinical radiology and radiation oncology
had the potential to grow rapidly and significantly impact the
professions. In order to address this, RANZCR drafted ethical principles
on the use of AI and standards to guide deployment and engaged in
extensive stakeholder consultation to ensure a range of perspectives

article,"Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in
primary schools","Background: The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence
(AI) knowledge to K-12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. Purpose: Guided by an integrated theoretical
framework of social constructionism, this research examined the process
of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed with external
influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives and responses
in mediating external influences into local schools and classrooms.
Methods: A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted in relation to an AI
curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS) teachers from primary
schools. Data collected from ethnographic observation, teacher
interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open coding and
triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist approach.
Results: Three sets of external influences were found salient for
teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of state-level
educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university, and students'
media and technology environments. The teachers' situational logics and
strategic actions were reconstructed with thick descriptions to uncover
how they navigated and negotiated the external influences to fulfill
local challenges and expectations in classrooms and schools.
Conclusions: The ethnographic study uncovered the dynamic and
multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative curriculum
development, and offers insights to inform policymaking, teacher
education, and student support in engineering education.","Dai, Yun and Liu, Ang and Qin, Jianjun and Guo, Yanmei and Jong, Morris

in quality control, managers assume that wide variation is likely
present unless proven otherwise with objective performance data. In this
article, we discuss what we consider to be the eight essential elements
required to achieve comprehensive process control, necessary to deliver
consistent quality in radiology: a process control framework,
performance measures, performance standards and targets, monitoring
applications, prediction models, optimization models, feedback
mechanisms, and accountability mechanisms. We consider these elements to
be universally applicable, including in the application of AI-based
models. We also discuss how the lack of specific elements of a quality
control program can hinder widespread quality control efforts. We
illustrate the concept using the example of a CT radiation dose

Artificial Intelligence: A Case Study of Cancer-Staging Data in Biology","It is essential to utilize deep-learning algorithms based on big data
for the implementation of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number
of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in
an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an
approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a
deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into
a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set
to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set.
Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples.
Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the
effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small
sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the
approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small
labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed
approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This
research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical
machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a
deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use
of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application
scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on
deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This

article,"Artificial intelligence divulges effective tactics of top management
institutes of India","Purpose The performance analysis of top 50 management institutions of
India is conducted to understand their efficiency in utilizing available
resources. The importance of different indicators is investigated to
identify most preferred strategies of top management institutions in the
country in order to meet the expectations of all stakeholders.
Artificial neural networks models are applied for pattern recognition
and classification purpose using self-organized map algorithms. A huge
reservoir of young generation is being trained every year to meet the
demand of business in different sectors of economies. It becomes a
matter of concern to know the performance of the management institutes
to ensure the overall national progress, which can be done by enabling
organizations to improve their efficiency and effectiveness, provided
the right information and skills are served. Data envelopment analysis
(DEA) and self-organizing maps are utilized together to take advantages
of optimization and prediction capabilities inherent in each method, and
they may be beneficial to assess institution's competitive position and
design their own strategies in order to improve. The paper aims to
discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The DEA is used to
understand the utilization of resources by institutions on the bases of
efficiency scores. Due to a greater flexibility and adaptability, neural
technique, i.e. self-organized map, which is an artificial
intelligence-based technique, a popular unsupervised learning model with
a capability to capture patterns from data sets, is used. In this study,
various parameters like qualification of faculty, research output of
faculty members, expenditure made for functioning of the institution,
etc., are considered. These academic and operational indicators are
investigated in relation to the rank score and the efficiency score of
top management institutions, and different strategies as a combination
of input as well as output indicators are identified. Findings In the
analysis, three types of strategies are identified. At present, the
focus on salary packages of graduates seems the most utilized strategy.
It is also observed that the strategy of having good performance, in
terms of consultancy, peer and employer perception, has the highest
success rate (in terms of score used for ranking). Results obtained
using both techniques shows that due to high deviation and less explored
research publications and sponsored research project is an opportunity
that institutions can work upon to have maximum output. But to maintain
consistency in terms of the high rank score and efficiency score,
management institutions need to focus on consultancy, peer and employer
perception. Practical implications - This research identifies the
different parameters categorized into various inputs and outputs for the
management institutions in India for the benchmarking. It studies the
importance of identified parameters in terms of success (rank score and
efficiency score). Further investigation of relationship between
parameters and success is conducted. Different strategies as a

management institutions is revealed in terms of their preference and
effectiveness of strategy. This research also provides some insight
about long-term and short-term strategies, which may be beneficial to
education managers or decision makers.

article,"Artificial intelligence-based decision-making for age-related macular
degeneration","Artificial intelligence (AI) based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve
health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation
of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine,
the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic
interfaces.
Methods: In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs
to perform AMD diagnosis.
Results: Here, we present an AI-and cloud-based telemedicine interaction
tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning
process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence
tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same
image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our
hospital. The AI platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than
90\% and was significantly superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical
students (69.4\% and 68.9\%) and equal (p = 0.99) to that of retinal
specialists (92.73\% and 91.90\%). Furthermore, it provided appropriate
treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists.
Conclusions: We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud
computing based on this AI platform, available at
https://www.ym.edu.tw/similar to AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT
images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require
treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution
for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.","Hwang, De-Kuang and Hsu, Chih-Chien and Chang, Kao-Jung and Chao, Daniel

article,"Metabolic syndrome screening in adolescents: New scores AI\_METS based
on artificial intelligence techniques","Background and aims: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions in
adolescents based on the percentiles of its components are rather
complicated to use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to
test the validity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based scores
(AI\_METS) that do not use these percentiles for MetS screening for
adolescents.Methods and results: This study included 1086 adolescents
aged 12 to 18. The cohort underwent anthropometric measurements and
blood tests. Mean blood pressure (MBP), and triglyceride glucose index
(TyG) were calculated. Explainable AI methods are used to extract the
learned function. Gini importance techniques were tested and used to
build new scores for the screening of MetS. IDF, Cook, De Ferranti,
Viner, and Weiss definitions of MetS were used to test the validity of
these scores.MetS prevalence was 0.4\%-4.7\% according to these
definitions. AI\_METS used age, waist circumference, MBP, and TyG index.
They offer area under the curves (AUCs) 0.91, 0.93, 0.89, 0.93, and
0.98; specificity 81\%, 75\%, 72\%, 80\%, and 97\%; and sensitivity
90\%, 100\%, 90\%, 100\%, and 100\%, respectively, for the detection of
MetS according to these definitions. Considering only MBP offers a
better specificity and sensitivity to detect MetS than considering only
TyG index. MBP offers slightly lower performance than
AI\_METS.Conclusion: AI techniques have proven their ability to extract
knowledge from data. They allowed us to generate new scores for MetS
detection in adolescents without using specific percentiles for each
component. Although these scores are less intuitive than the
percentile-based definition, their accuracy is rather effective for the
detection of MetS.(c) 2022 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian

Opportunities, Challenges, Pitfalls, and Criteria for Success","Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications,
including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability
of large datasets ({''}big data{''}), substantial advances in computing
power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI
methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the
imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature,
better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program
use across different imaging platforms and Patient populations. AI
surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by
identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs
can be used to extract ``radiomic{''} information from images not
discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic
and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been
made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue
has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will
beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current
limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing
power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote
access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value
created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better
outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists.

article,"Gamification as a Growing Trend in Higher Education: Prospects and
Problems","The article deals with the phenomenon of gamification and the problems
of im-plementing game practices in higher education. Based on the
information about consumer habits, style features of behavior, etc.,
gamification becomes a fairly effective IT tool that contributes to
achieving the goals of one or another project by way of constructing
artificially player motivation, i.e., in fact, programming for a certain
behavior pattern. The paper notes that the Western trend of mass
in-clusion of games and game technologies in curricula has become a
significant reference point for domestic educational policy, and
gamification is now dis-cussed as a new, alternative way of organizing
learning in educational institu-tions of our country, which allows to
significantly influence student behavior and the effectiveness of
learning outcomes. Analyzing possible consequences and trying to take
into account the explicit and latent risks, the author concludes that
the most alarming trend of gamification implementation in the
educational process is the creation of unprecedented opportunities for
collecting data on student be-havior in the digital educational space.
Tracking reactions and psychoemotional state of young people in the
course of gamified learning, the use of artificial in-telligence
technologies, neural networks, the use of learning action analysis
tech-nologies, digital footprint analysis - all these may help to build
and improve the behavior management strategy required by customers. Here
we see the pro-spects of making a testing range for large-scale work to
create additional means of control, standardization and correction with
the view to improve the tech-niques of manipulating the consciousness
and behavior of the masses of people. In the author's opinion, the
transformation of learning into a computer game will promote not only a
significant deformation of the inner meaning of pedagogics, but also the
transformation of student youth into an object of various manipu-lations

describing the development and validation of AI models aimed at
diagnosing knee or hip joint pathologies or predicting their development

Results 56 articles were found that meet all the inclusion criteria. We
identified two problems that block the full integration of AI into the

insufficient amount, variety and quality of data for training, and
validation and testing of AI models. The second problem is the rarity of
rational evaluation of models, which is why their real quality cannot
always be evaluated.
Conclusion The vastness and relevance of the studied topic are beyond

article,"Artificial Intelligence May Cause a Significant Disruption to the
Radiology Workforce","The increasingly realistic prospect of artificial intelligence (AI)
playing an important role in radiology has been welcomed with a mixture
of enthusiasm and anxiousness. A consensus has arisen that AI will
support radiologists in the interpretation of less challenging cases,
which will give the radiologists more time to focus on the challenging
tasks as well as interactions with patients and other clinicians. The
possibility of AI replacing a large number of radiologists is generally
dismissed by the radiology community. The common arguments include the
following: (1) AI will never be able to match radiologists' performance;
(2) radiologists do more than interpret images; (3) even if AI takes
over a large portion of the reading tasks, the radiologists' effort will
be shifted toward interactions with patients and other physicians; (4)
the FDA would never agree to let machines do the work of radiologist;
(5) the issues of legal liability would be insurmountable; and (6)
patients would never put complete trust in computer algorithms. In this
article, I analyze these arguments in detail. I find a certain level of
validity to some of them. However, I conclude that none of the arguments
provide sufficient support for the claim that AI will not create a
significant disruption in the radiology workforce. Such disruption is a
real possibility. Although the radiology specialty has shown an

regions. This paper presents an artificial intelligence and big data
analytics-based ICH e-diagnosis (AIBDA-ICH) model using CT images. The
presented model utilizes IoMT devices for data acquisition process. The
presented AIBDA-ICH model involves graph cut-based segmentation model
for identifying the affected regions in the CT images. To manage big
data, Hadoop Ecosystem and its elements are mainly used. In addition,
capsule network (CapsNet) model is applied as a feature extractor to
derive a useful set of feature vectors. Finally, the presented AIBDA-ICH
model makes use of the fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) model to carry
out classification process. For validating the superior performance of
the AIBDA-ICH method, an extensive set of simulations were performed and
the outcomes are examined under diverse aspects. The experimental values
pointed out the improved e-diagnostic performance of the AIBDA-ICH model
over the other compared methods with the precision and accuracy of
94.96\% and 98.59\%, respectively.","Mansour, Romany F. and Escorcia-Gutierrez, Jose and Gamarra, Margarita

article,"The role of artificial intelligence in surgical patient perioperative
management","Perioperative medicine is a patient-centered, multidisciplinary and
integrated clinical practice that starts from the moment of
contemplation of surgery until full recovery. Every perioperative phase
(preoperative. intraoperative and postoperative) must be studied and
planned in order to optimize the entire patient management.
Perioperative optimization does not only concern a short-term outcome
improvement, but it has also a strong impact on long term survival.
Clinical cases variability leads to the collection and analysis of a
huge amount of different data, coming from multiple sources, making
perioperative management standardization very difficult. Artificial
Intelligence (AI) can play a primary role in this challenge, helping
human mind in perioperative practice planning and decision-making
process. AI refers to the ability of a computer system to perform
functions and reasoning typical of the human mind; Machine Learning (ML)
could play a fundamental role in presurgical planning, during
intraoperative phase and postoperative management. Perioperative
medicine is the cornerstone of surgical patient management and the tools
deriving from the application of AI seem very promising as a support in
optimizing the management of each individual patient. Despite the
increasing help that derive from the use of AI tools, the uniqueness of
the patient and the particularity of each individual clinical case will
always keep the role of the human mind central in clinical and
perioperative management. The role of the physician, who must analyze
the outputs provided by AI by following his own experience and
knowledge, remains and will always be essential.","Bignami, Elena G. and Cozzani, Federico and del Rio, Paolo and Bellini,

Overview of Available Tools","In the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in applying
artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the field of radiology.
Currently, numerous AI applications are in development, with potential
benefits spanning all steps of the imaging chain from test ordering to
report communication. AI has been proposed as a means to optimize
patient scheduling, improve worklist management, enhance image
acquisition, and help radiologists interpret diagnostic studies.
Although the potential for AI in radiology appears almost endless, the
field is still in the early stages, with many uses still theoretical, in
development, or limited to single institutions. Moreover, although the
current use of AI in radiology has emphasized its clinical applications,
some of which are in the distant future, it is increasingly clear that
AI algorithms could also be used in the more immediate future for a
variety of noninterpretive and quality improvement uses. Such uses
include the integration of AI into electronic health record systems to
reduce unwarranted variation in radiologists' follow-up recommendations
and to improve other dimensions of radiology report quality. In the end,
the potential of AI in radiology must be balanced with acknowledgment of
its current limitations regarding generalizability and data privacy.","Kapoor, Neena and Lacson, Ronilda and Khorasani, Ramin",Artificial intelligence; machine learning; natural language processing,10.1016/j.jacr.2020.08.016,2020,8

article,"Korean dental hygiene students' perceptions and attitudes toward
artificial intelligence: An online survey","ObjectivesThis study investigated Korean dental hygiene students'
perceptions and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and aimed
to identify needs for education to strengthen professional competencies.
MethodsA 24-question online survey was conducted to the dental hygiene
students from four Korean schools in 2021. The questionnaire included
seven questions on basic characteristics and 17 AI-related questions on
the student's attitudes toward AI, the confidence in AI, predictions
about AI, and its future prospects. Responses were analyzed according to
the frequencies and correlations between the participants' subjective
level of knowledge about AI and questions using chi-square test.
ResultsInvitations were sent out to 1310 students and 800 (61.1\%)
participated. Note that 44.2\% of participants were interested in AI,
and 93.1\% accessed AI-related information through the internet.
Participants expressed lower confidence in AI's diagnosis (14.8\%) and
judgment (8.1\%) than in those of humans, and 21.9\% believed AI would
replace their job. The proportions of participants with positive
perceptions of the usefulness and the potential for improvement of AI in
dentistry were 65.5\% and 55.4\%, respectively. Participants from
schools who had existing AI knowledge expressed higher demands for
AI-related content as compared to those who did not (p < 0.05).
ConclusionAlthough dental hygiene students expressed low level of
confidence in AI, they were interested in AI and had positive views of
its application and potential for improvement. However, the fact they
had little AI-related information from dental hygiene curriculum

article,"Economic Impact of Artificial Intelligence: New Look for the
Macroeconomic Assessment in Asia-Pacific Region","Objective: To determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on
the selected economies in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: This
secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific
data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included
digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The
focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business
operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of
international organizations' including the World Economic Forum, the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19
economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected
economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between
2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents
on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish
over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order
include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such,
this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and
Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their
higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI
research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher
number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals.
Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998-2016 with annual
observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were
presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the
future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while
empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At
second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings
with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third,
other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index
and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in
current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies.
Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main
driver of Asia-Pacific's economic growth. Relative to the net and gross
effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of
the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield
a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of
\$13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared
to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the
availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can
move ahead-given better resource and talent allocation. (C) 2019 The

frontline physicians to effectively triage COVID-19 patients during the
pandemic. This study aimed to develop an efficient deep-learning
artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable
predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help
clinicians triage COVID-19 patients.
MethodsThis retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients
with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21,
2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was
mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and
laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78
clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification
score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into
85\% training and 15\% testing. Prediction performance was compared with
those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score, and pneumonia
severity index (PSI).
ResultsOf the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five
top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O-2 Index,
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate
dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score
yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 (95\% CI =
0.87-1.0) and 0.954 (95\% CI = 0.80-0.99) for the testing dataset. Our
models outperformed COVID-19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB-65 score

article,"Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Harnessing big data to predict
oral cancer survival","BACKGROUND
Oral cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Public
knowledge in oral cancer risk factors and survival is limited.
AIM
To come up with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the length
of survival for individuals diagnosed with oral cancer, and to explore
the most important factors that were responsible for shortening or
lengthening oral cancer survival.
METHODS
We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from
the years 1975 to 2016 that consisted of a total of 257880 cases and 94
variables. Four ML techniques in the area of artificial intelligence
were applied for model training and validation. Model accuracy was
evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE),
root mean squared error (RMSE), R-2 and adjusted R-2.
RESULTS
The most important factors predictive of oral cancer survival time were
age at diagnosis, primary cancer site, tumor size and year of diagnosis.
Year of diagnosis referred to the year when the tumor was first
diagnosed, implying that individuals with tumors that were diagnosed in
the modern era tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in the
past. The extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms showed the best
performance, with the MAE equaled to 13.55, MSE 486.55 and RMSE 22.06.
CONCLUSION
Using artificial intelligence, we developed a tool that can be used for
oral cancer survival prediction and for medical-decision making. The
finding relating to the year of diagnosis represented an important new
discovery in the literature. The results of this study have implications
for cancer prevention and education for the public.","Hung, Man and Park, Jungweon and Hon, Eric S. and Bounsanga, Jerry and

Potential Future Use","Objectives: With much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) rendering
radiologists redundant, a simple radiologist-augmented AI workflow is
evaluated; the premise is that inclusion of a radiologist's opinion into
an AI algorithm would make the algorithm achieve better accuracy than an
algorithm trained on imaging parameters alone. Open-source BI-RADS data
sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist's opinion
(in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters
improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine
learning algorithms vis-a-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.
Materials and Methods: BI-RADS data sets were obtained from the
University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set
1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data
set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold
cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion
shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture
parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters
and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under
the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the
validation data set.
Results: The models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS
classification performed significantly better than the models not using
them (P < .0001).

specifically enriched with flat lesions and SSLs, including a
challenging dataset containing subtle advanced neoplasia. The
challenging dataset was also evaluated by eight endoscopists (four
independent, four trainees, according to the Joint Advisory Group on

first two video datasets, the algorithm achieved per-polyp sensitivities
of 100\% and 98.9\%. Per-frame sensitivities were 84.1\% and 85.2\%. In
the subtle dataset, the algorithm detected a significantly higher number
of polyps (P < 0.0001), compared to JAG-independent and trainee
endoscopists, achieving per-polyp sensitivities of 79.5\%, 37.2\% and

detected by both the algorithm and at least one endoscopist, the AI
detected polyps significantly faster on average. Conclusions The AI

colorectal neoplasia, including flat lesions and SSLs, outperforming
both JAG independent and trainees on a very challenging dataset
containing subtle lesions that could have been overlooked easily and
contribute to interval colorectal cancer. Further prospective trials

article,"Teaching Machine Learning in K-12 Classroom: Pedagogical and
Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education","Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine
learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and
data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine
learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher
education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it
in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the
context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as
schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional
computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into
school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine
learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing
education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and
AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research
body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn
to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is
especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the
emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology
related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
situates the existing work in the context of computing education in
general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators
should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses
on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to
successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing
curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based
``traditional{''} programming is a central aspect and building block in
developing next generation computational thinking.","Tedre, Matti and Toivonen, Tapani and Kahila, Juho and Vartiainen,

in the Diagnosis, Prediction, and Classification of Cardiovascular
Diseases","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML), as well as the arrival of the big data era, technological
innovations have occurred in the field of cardiovascular medicine.
First, the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is highly
dependent on assistive examinations, the interpretation of which is time
consuming and often limited by the knowledge level and clinical
experience of doctors; however, AI could be used to automatically
interpret the images obtained in auxiliary examinations. Second, some of
the predictions of the incidence and prognosis of CVDs are limited in
clinical practice by the use of traditional prediction models, but there
may be occasions when AI-based prediction models perform well by using
ML algorithms. Third, AI has been used to assist precise classification
of CVDs by integrating a variety of medical data from patients, which
helps better characterize the subgroups of heterogeneous diseases. To
help clinicians better understand the applications of AI in CVDs, this
review summarizes studies relating to AI-based diagnosis, prediction,
and classification of CVDs. Finally, we discuss the challenges of
applying AI to cardiovascular medicine.","Shu, Songren and Ren, Jie and Song, Jiangping","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cardiovascular diseases; Machine

article,Three artificial intelligence data challenges based on CT and MRI,"Purpose: The second edition of the artificial intelligence (AI) data
challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology with the aim
to: (i), work on relevant public health issues; (ii), build large,
multicentre, high quality databases; and (iii), include
three-dimensional (3D) information and prognostic questions.
Materials and methods: Relevant clinical questions were proposed by
French subspecialty colleges of radiology. Their feasibility was
assessed by experts in the field of AI. A dedicated platform was set up
for inclusion centers to safely upload their anonymized examinations in
compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the
database was checked by experts weekly with annotations performed by
radiologists. Multidisciplinary teams competed between September 11th
and October 13th 2019.
Results: Three questions were selected using different imaging and
evaluation modalities, including: pulmonary nodule detection and
classification from 3D computed tomography (CT), prediction of expanded
disability status scale in multiple sclerosis using 3D magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and segmentation of muscular surface for
sarcopenia estimation from two-dimensional CT. A total of 4347
examinations were gathered of which only 6\% were excluded. Three
independent databases from 24 individual centers were created. A total
of 143 participants were split into 20 multidisciplinary teams.
Conclusion: Three data challenges with over 1200 general data protection
regulation compliant CT or MRI examinations each were organized. Future
challenges should be made with more complex situations combining
histopathological or genetic information to resemble real life
situations faced by radiologists in routine practice. (C) 2020 Societe

article,"Artificial Intelligence: Guidance for clinical imaging and therapeutic
radiography professionals, a summary by the Society of Radiographers AI
working group","Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) has started to be
increasingly adopted in medical imaging and radiotherapy clinical
practice, however research, education and partnerships have not really
caught up yet to facilitate a safe and effective transition. The aim of
the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working
in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and
stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the
multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including
all staff, volunteers, students and learners.
Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR
working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a
rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review.
Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as
well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from
external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback
received and a final consensus was reached.
Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with
to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and
radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately
adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary
knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic
radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be
central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led
research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable
radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions.
Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is
integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients
and service users.
Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with
AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for
different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our
educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong
clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice.
Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education,
research and the forging of partnerships with key stakeholders are
discussed, with potential impact on policy and practice in all these
domains. These recommendations aim to serve as baseline guidance for UK
radiographers.
Implications for practice: This review offers the most up-to-date
recommendations for clinical practitioners, researchers, academics and
service users of clinical imaging and therapeutic radiography services.
Radiography practice, education and research must gradually adjust to
AI-enabled healthcare systems to ensure gains of AI technologies are
maximised and challenges and risks are minimised. This guidance will
need to be updated regularly given the fast-changing pace of AI

article,"Artificial Intelligence for Automatic Measurement of Left Ventricular
Strain in Echocardiography","OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine if fully automated measurements
of global longitudinal strain (GLS) using a novel motion estimation
technology based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are
feasible and comparable with a conventional speckle-tracking
application. BACKGROUND GLS is an important parameter when evaluating
left ventricular function. However, analyses of GLS are time consuming
and demand expertise, and thus are underused in clinical practice.
METHODS In this study, 200 patients with a wide range of left ventricle
(LV) function were included. Three standard apical cine-loops were
analyzed using the AI pipeline. The AI method measured GLS and was
compared with a commercially available semiautomatic speckle-tracking
software (EchoPAC v202, GE Healthcare. RESULTS The AI method succeeded
to both correctly classify all 3 standard apical views and perform
timing of cardiac events in 89\% of patients. Furthermore, the method
successfully performed automatic segmentation, motion estimates, and
measurements of GLS in all examinations, across different cardiac
pathologies and throughout the spectrum of LV function. GLS was-12.0 +/-
4.1\% for the AI method and-13.5 +/- 5.3\% for the reference method.
Bias was-1.4 +/- 0.3\% (95\% limits of agreement: 2.3 to-5.1), which is
comparable with intervendor studies. The AI method eliminated
measurement variability and a complete GLS analysis was processed within
15 s. CONCLUSIONS Through the range of LV function this novel AI method
succeeds, without any operator input, to automatically identify the 3
standard apical views, perform timing of cardiac events, trace the
myocardium, perform motion estimation, and measure GLS. Fully automated
measurements based on AI could facilitate the clinical implementation of
GLS. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2021;14:1918-1928) (c) 2021 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the impact of an
automated AI platform integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
interpretation on radiologists' interpretation times when evaluated in a
real-world clinical setting.
METHODS. In this prospective single-center study, a commercial AI
software solution was integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
interpretation. The software provided automated analysis of cardiac,
pulmonary, and musculoskeletal findings, including labeling, segmenting,
and measuring normal structures as well as detecting, labeling, and
measuring abnormalities. AI-annotated images and autogenerated summary
results were stored in the PACS and available to interpreting
radiologists. A total of 390 patients (204 women, 186 men; mean age,
62.8 +/- 13.3 {[}SD] years) who underwent outpatient chest CT between
January 19, 2021, and January 28, 2021, were included. Scans were
randomized using 1:1 allocation between AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted
arms and were clinically interpreted by one of three cardiothoracic
radiologists (65 scans per arm per radiologist; total of 195 scans per
arm) who recorded interpretation times using a stopwatch. Findings were
categorized according to review of report impressions. Interpretation
times were compared between arms.
RESULTS. Mean interpretation times were significantly shorter in the
AI-assisted than in the non-AI-assisted arm for all three readers (289
+/- 89 vs 344 +/- 129 seconds, p < .001; 449 +/- 110 vs 649 +/- 82
seconds, p < .001; 281 +/- 114 vs 348 +/- 93 seconds, p = .01) and for
readers combined (328 +/- 122 vs 421 +/- 175 seconds, p < .001). For
readers combined, the mean difference was 93 seconds (95\% CI, 63-123
seconds), corresponding with a 22.1\% reduction in the AI-assisted arm.
Mean interpretation time was also shorter in the AI-assisted arm
compared with the non-AI-assisted arm for contrast- enhanced scans (83
seconds), noncontrast scans (104 seconds), negative scans (84 seconds),
positive scans without significant new findings (117 seconds), and
positive scans with significant new findings (92 seconds).
CONCLUSION. Cardiothoracic radiologists exhibited a 22.1\% reduction in

Structural Heart Disease","Structural heart disease (SHD) is a new field within cardiovascular
medicine. Traditional imaging modalities fall short in supporting the
needs of SHD interventions, as they have been constructed around the
concept of disease diagnosis. SHD interventions disrupt traditional
concepts of imaging in requiring imaging to plan, simulate, and predict
intraprocedural outcomes. In transcatheter SHD interventions, the
absence of a gold-standard open cavity surgical field deprives
physicians of the opportunity for tactile feedback and visual
confirmation of cardiac anatomy. Hence, dependency on imaging in
periprocedural guidance has led to evolution of a new generation of
procedural skillsets, concept of a visual field, and technologies in the
periprocedural planning period to accelerate preclinical device
development, physician, and patient education. Adaptation of
3-dimensional (3D) printing in clinical care and procedural planning has
demonstrated a reduction in early-operator learning curve for
transcatheter interventions. Integration of computation modeling to 3D
printing has accelerated research and development understanding of fluid
mechanics within device testing. Application of 3D printing,
computational modeling, and ultimately incorporation of artificial

article,"A Survey of Deep-Learning Applications in Ultrasound: Artificial
Intelligence-Powered Ultrasound for Improving Clinical Workflow","Ultrasound is the most commonly used imaging modality in clinical
practice because it is a nonionizing, low-cost, and portable
point-of-care imaging tool that provides real-time images. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-powered ultrasound is becoming more mature and getting
closer to routine clinical applications in recent times because of an
increased need for efficient and objective acquisition and evaluation of
ultrasound images. Because ultrasound images involve operator-,
patient-, and scanner-dependent variations, the adaptation of classical
machine learning methods to clinical applications becomes challenging.
With their self-learning ability, deep-learning (DL) methods are able to
harness exponentially growing graphics processing unit computing power
to identify abstract and complex imaging features. This has given rise
to tremendous opportunities such as providing robust and generalizable
AI models for improving image acquisition, real-time assessment of image
quality, objective diagnosis and detection of diseases, and optimizing
ultrasound clinical workflow. In this report, the authors review current
DL approaches and research directions in rapidly advancing ultrasound

education, and it is related to optimization of task based on
fundamental scenario in establishing morality. In order to establish a

ideological education. In this paper, firstly, in view of the
shortcomings of evaluation objectives, single evaluation methods, lack
of pertinence of evaluation indicators and subjectivity of evaluation
standards in the current evaluation system of university students'
ideological and political education, the basic principles for
constructing evaluation models of university students' ideological and

artificial intelligence data mining and a traditional multi-layer fuzzy
evaluation model are designed to evaluate the ideological and political
education of college students. This newly proposed model integrates
learning, association, recognition, self-adaptive and fuzzy information
processing, and at the same time, it overcomes their respective
shortcomings. Finally, an example analysis is carried out with a nearby
university as an example. The evaluation results display that the
evaluation model of students' ideological education established in this

the application of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems and artificial

screening have followed a rules-based approach, incorporating domain
knowledge into hand-crafted features before using classical machine

ImageChecker M1000, relies on computer vision techniques for pattern
recognition. Unfortunately, CAD systems have been shown to adversely
affect some radiologists' performance and increase recall rates. The
Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge was a multidisciplinary
collaboration that provided 640,000 mammography images for teams to help
decrease false-positive rates in breast cancer screening. Winning
solutions leveraged deep learning's (DL) automatic hierarchical feature
learning capabilities and used convolutional neural networks. Start-ups
Therapixel and Kheiron Medical Technologies are using DL for breast
cancer screening. With increasing use of digital breast tomosynthesis,

STUDY DESIGN: The study included a systematic literature search, a
virtual conference, and a 3-round Delphi survey of 40 representative
multidisciplinary stakeholders with domain expertise selected through
purposeful sampling. The accelerated Delphi process was completed within
10 days. The survey covered overall utility, anticipated future (10-year
time horizon), and applications for surgical training, assessment, and
feedback. Consensus was agreement among 80\% or more respondents. We
coded survey questions into 11 themes and descriptively analyzed the
responses.
RESULTS: The respondents included surgeons (40\%), engineers (15\%),
affiliates of industry (27.5\%), professional societies (7.5\%),
regulatory agencies (7.5\%), and a lawyer (2.5\%). The survey included
155 questions; consensus was achieved on 136 (87.7\%). The panel listed
6 deliverables each for AI-enhanced learning curve analytics and
surgical skill assessment. For feedback, the panel identified 10
priority deliverables spanning 2-year (n = 2), 5-year (n = 4), and
10-year (n = 4) time-frames. Within 2 years, the panel expects
development of methods to recognize anatomy in images of the surgical
field and to provide surgeons with performance feedback immediately

blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation
of an individual learning path through testing students before the start
of training. Based on the learning outcomes, the student is credited to
the learning path. The training path consists of mandatory and
additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after
successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper

contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability
to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use
the information received or not), personal characteristics (type,
orientation) and other factors. The student's model is described by a

article,"Artificial Intelligence in Steam Cracking Modeling: A Deep Learning
Algorithm for Detailed Effluent Prediction","Chemical processes can benefit tremendously from fast and accurate
effluent composition prediction for plant design, control, and
optimization. The Industry 4.0 revolution claims that by introducing
machine learning into these fields, substantial economic and
environmental gains can be achieved. The bottleneck for high-frequency
optimization and process control is often the time necessary to perform
the required detailed analyses of, for example, feed and product. To
resolve these issues, a framework of four deep learning artificial
neural networks (DL ANNs) has been developed for the largest chemicals
production process-steam cracking. The proposed methodology allows both
a detailed characterization of a naphtha feedstock and a detailed
composition of the steam cracker effluent to be determined, based on a
limited number of commercial naphtha indices and rapidly accessible
process characteristics. The detailed characterization of a naphtha is
predicted from three points on the boiling curve and paraffins,
iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aronatics (PIONA)
characterization. If unavailable, the boiling points are also estimated.
Even with estimated boiling points, the developed DL ANN outperforms
several established methods such as maximization of Shannon entropy and
traditional ANNs. For feedstock reconstruction, a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 0.3 wt\% is achieved on the test set, while the MAE of the
effluent prediction is 0.1 wt\%. When combining all networks-using the
output of the previous as input to the next-the effluent MAE increases
to 0.19 wt\%. In addition to the high accuracy of the networks, a major
benefit is the negligible computational cost required to obtain the
predictions. On a standard Intel i7 processor, predictions are made in
the order of milliseconds. Commercial software such as COILSIM1D
performs slightly better in terms of accuracy, but the required central
processing unit time per reaction is in the order of seconds. This
tremendous speed-up and minimal accuracy loss make the presented
framework highly suitable for the continuous monitoring of
difficult-to-access process parameters and for the envisioned,
high-frequency real-time optimization (RTO) strategy or process control.
Nevertheless, the lack of a fundamental basis implies that fundamental

article,"Data Centric Molecular Analysis and Evaluation of Hepatocellular
Carcinoma Therapeutics Using Machine Intelligence-Based Tools","Purpose Computational approaches have been used at different stages of
drug development with the purpose of decreasing the time and cost of
conventional experimental procedures. Lately, techniques mainly
developed and applied in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), have
been transferred to different application domains such as biomedicine.
Methods In this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via
data-driven evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
therapeutics in the context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing.
First, we discussed basic concepts, computational approaches, databases,
modeling approaches, and featurization techniques in drug
discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we automatically integrated
HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, pathways,
phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar
implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a
knowledge graph using the CROssBAR system. Results Following the
system-level evaluation and selection of critical genes/proteins and
pathways to target, our deep learning-based drug/compound-target protein
interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have been employed for
predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these critical targets.
Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated proteins which
had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D space
to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug
candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.
Conclusions We expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be
used as a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from
database-scale sets of compounds) to both HCC and other complex
diseases, which may subsequently be analyzed with more targeted in
silico and experimental approaches.","Cetin-Atalay, Rengul and Kahraman, Deniz Cansen and Nalbat, Esra and

different membership functions of ANFIS","Modeling suspended sediment load is a critical element of water
resources engineering. In this work, using the ANFIS method, everyday
suspended sediment particles were estimated in different categories of
the river in US Sediment big data, and various flow rates were utilized
for testing and training. The artificial intelligent (AI) method called
ANFIS is used to train actual data from the river and provide an AI
model with artificial data points. This artificial data point can show
the occurrence of disaster for a critical day with different flow rates.
The changing parameter in the AI model enables us to make a correct
decision about critical time for rivers. This study also concentrates on
the sensitivity investigation of ANFIS setting parameters on the
accurateness of numerical results in order to find the best ANFIS model
for rapid oscillation in the data set. The best performance of the ANFIS
method is achieved with the trimf membership function, the number of
input membership function = 16, and the number of iteration = 1000. The
results also showed that the ANFIS model can provide fast computational
calculation, and adding more nodes for the prediction cannot change the
overall time of calculation due to the meshless behavior of the model.
In addition to this model, we used the ant colony method for training of

article,"Automated Echocardiographic Detection of Severe Coronary Artery Disease
Using Artificial Intelligence","OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to establish whether an
artificially intelligent (AI) system can be developed to automate stress
echocardiography analysis and support clinician
interpretation.BACKGROUND Coronary artery disease is the leading global
cause of mortality and morbidity and stress echocardi-ography remains
one of the most commonly used diagnostic imaging tests.METHODS An
automated image processing pipeline was developed to extract novel
geometric and kinematic features from stress echocardiograms collected
as part of a large, United Kingdom-based prospective, multicenter,
multivendor study. An ensemble machine learning classifier was trained,
using the extracted features, to identify patients with severe coronary
artery disease on invasive coronary angiography. The model was tested in
an independent U.S. study. How availability of an AI classification
might impact clinical interpretation of stress echocardiograms was
evaluated in a randomized crossover reader study.RESULTS Acceptable
classification accuracy for identification of patients with severe
coronary artery disease in the training data set was achieved on
cross-fold validation based on 31 unique geometric and kinematic
features, with a specificity of 92.7\% and a sensitivity of 84.4\%. This
accuracy was maintained in the independent validation data set. The use
of the AI classification tool by clinicians increased inter-reader
agreement and confidence as well as sensitivity for detection of disease
by 10\% to achieve an area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve of 0.93.CONCLUSIONS Automated analysis of stress echocardiograms
is possible using AI and provision of automated clas-sifications to
clinicians when reading stress echocardiograms could improve accuracy,
inter-reader agreement, and reader confidence. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img

increasing in prosthodontics. Still, the current development and
performance of artificial intelligence in prosthodontic applications has
not yet been systematically documented and analyzed. Purpose. The
purpose of this systematic review was to assess the performance of the
artificial intelligence models in prosthodontics for tooth shade
selection, automation of restoration design, mapping the tooth
preparation finishing line, optimizing the manufacturing casting,
predicting facial changes in patients with removable prostheses, and
designing removable partial dentures. Material and methods. An
electronic systematic review was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE,
Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus. A manual search was also
conducted. Studies with artificial intelligence models were selected
based on 6 criteria: tooth shade selection, automated fabrication of
dental restorations, mapping the finishing line of tooth preparations,
optimizing the manufacturing casting process, predicting facial changes
in patients with removable prostheses, and designing removable partial
dentures. Two investigators independently evaluated the quality
assessment of the studies by applying the Joanna Briggs Institute

article,"Cyclists and autonomous vehicles at odds Can the Transport Oppression
Cycle be Broken in the Era of Artificial Intelligence?","Consequential historical decisions that shaped transportation systems
and their influence on society have many valuable lessons. The decisions
we learn from and choose to make going forward will play a key role in
shaping the mobility landscape of the future. This is especially
pertinent as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more prevalent in the
form of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Throughout urban history, there have
been cyclical transport oppressions of previous-generation
transportation methods to make way for novel transport methods. These
cyclical oppressions can be identified in the baroque and modernist
periods, and a third oppression may occur in the contemporary period. To
explore the idea of a third oppression, we focus on the bicycle and
outline the history of cycling to understand how historical mode
oppression unfolded. We then present several social and political
factors that contributed to the oppression of cycling and share
recommendations for how to avoid future oppressions including political,
social, and design actions for researchers and policymakers to take.
This paper argues that priorities for AI-enabled mobility and cyclist
needs be advanced in proportion to the extent that they contribute to
societal goals of urban containment, public realm, and proximal cities.
Additionally, future mobility evolutions should prioritise mobility

innovations in diagnosing, treating, and dispositioning patients during
high census conditions with constrained resources. Our objective is to
describe first experiences of physician interaction with a novel
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to enhance physician
abilities to identify ground-glass opacities and consolidation on chest
radiographs.
MethodsDuring the first wave of the pandemic, we deployed a previously
developed and validated deep-learning AI algorithm for assisted
interpretation of chest radiographs for use by physicians at an academic
health system in Southern California. The algorithm overlays radiographs
with ``heat{''} maps that indicate pneumonia probability alongside
standard chest radiographs at the point of care. Physicians were
surveyed in real time regarding ease of use and impact on clinical
decisionmaking.
ResultsOf the 5125 total visits and 1960 chest radiographs obtained in
the emergency department (ED) during the study period, 1855 were
analyzed by the algorithm. Among these, emergency physicians were
surveyed for their experiences on 202 radiographs. Overall, 86\% either
strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the intervention was easy to use
in their workflow. Of the respondents, 20\% reported that the algorithm
impacted clinical decisionmaking.
ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first published literature

factors as linear and additive. Clinical reality suggests that the
presence of certain risk factors can alter the impact of other factors;
in other words, risk modeling is not linear. We aimed to use artificial
intelligence (AI) technology to design and validate a nonlinear risk
calculator for trauma patients. METHODS A novel, interpretable AI
technology called Optimal Classification Trees (OCTs) was used in an
80:20 derivation/validation split of the 2010 to 2016 American College
of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics,
emergency department vital signs, comorbidities, and injury
characteristics (e.g., severity, mechanism) of all blunt and penetrating
trauma patients 18 years or older were used to develop, train then
validate OCT algorithms to predict in-hospital mortality and
complications (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis). A
smartphone application was created as the algorithm's interactive and
user-friendly interface. Performance was measured using the c-statistic
methodology. RESULTS A total of 934,053 patients were included (747,249

article,"PREDICTING THE MENTAL STRESS LEVEL OF DRIVERS IN A BRAKING CAR PROCESS
USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","Background: Reducing the physical and mental weariness of drivers is
significant in improving healthy and safe driving. This paper is aim to
predict the stress level of drivers while braking in various conditions
of the track. By discovering the drivers' mental stress level, we are
able to safely and comfortably adjust the distance in relation to the
vehicle ahead.
Material/Methods: The initial step used was a study related to
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), safe distance
in braking, and the theory of mental stress. The data was collected by
doing a direct measurement of drivers' stress levels using the EEG tool.
The respondents were 5 parties around 30-50 years old who had experience
in driving for > 5 years. The research asembled 400 pieces of data about
braking including the data of the velocity before braking, track
varieties (cityroad, rural road, residential road, and toll road),
braking distance, stress level (EEG), and focus (EEG). The database
constructed was used to input the machine learning (AI) - Back
Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) in order to predict the drivers'
mental stress level.
Results: Referring to the data collection, each road type gave a
different value of metal stress and focus. City road drivers used an
average velocity of 23.24 Km/h with an average braking distance of 11.17
m which generated an average stress level of 53.44 and a focus value of
45.76.Under other conditions, city road drivers generated a 52.11 stress
level, the rural road = 48.65, and 50.23 for the toll road. BPNN
Training with 1 hidden layer, neuron = 17, ground transfer function,
sigmoid linear, and optimation using Genetic Algorithm (GA) obtained the
Mean Square Error (MSE) value = 0.00537. The road infrastructure,
driving behavior, and emerging hazards in driving took part in
increasing the stress level and concentration needs of the drivers.
Conclusion: The conclusion may be drawn that the available data and the
chosen BPNN structure were appropriate to be used in training and be
utilized to predict drivers' focus and mental stress level. This AI
module is beneficial in inputting the data to the braking car safety
system by considering those mental factors completing the existing
technical factor considerations.","Sugiono, Sugiono and Prasetya, Renaldi P. and Fanani, Angga A. and

article,"Untangling hybrid hydrological models with explainable artificial
intelligence","Hydrological models are valuable tools for developing streamflow
predictions in unmonitored catchments to increase our understanding of
hydrological processes. A recent effort has been made in the development
of hybrid (conceptual/machine learning) models that can preserve some of
the hydrological processes represented by conceptual models and can
improve streamflow predictions. However, these studies have not explored
how the data-driven component of hybrid models resolved runoff routing.
In this study, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are
used to turn a `black-box' model into a `glass box' model. The hybrid
models reduced the root-mean-square error of the simulated streamflow
values by approximately 27, 50, and 24\% for stations 17120000,
27380000, and 33680000, respectively, relative to the traditional
method. XAI techniques helped unveil the importance of accounting for
soil moisture in hydrological models. Differing from purely data-driven
hydrological models, the inclusion of the production storage in the
proposed hybrid model, which is responsible for estimating the water
balance, reduced the short- and long-term dependencies of input
variables for streamflow prediction. In addition, soil moisture
controlled water percolation, which was the main predictor of
streamflow. This finding is because soil moisture controls the
underlying mechanisms of groundwater flow into river streams.","Althoff, Daniel and Bazame, Helizani Couto and Nascimento, Jessica

article,"The diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence algorithms for
identifying M2 segment middle cerebral artery occlusions: A systematic
review and meta-analysis","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have been
developed to facilitate rapid and accurate computed tomography
angiography (CTA) assessment in proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO)
acute ischemic stroke, including internal carotid artery and M1
occlusions. In clinical practice, however, the detection of medium
vessel occlusion (MeVO) represents an ongoing diagnostic challenge in
which the added value of AI remains unclear. Purpose: To assess the
diagnostic performance of AI platforms for detecting M2 occlusions.
Methods: Studies that report the diagnostic performance of AI-based
detection of M2 occlusions were screened, and sensitivity and
specificity data were extracted using the semi-automated AutoLit
software (Nested Knowledge, MN) platform. STATA (version 16 IC; Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to conduct all
analyses. Results: Eight studies with a low risk of bias and significant
heterogeneity were included in the quantitative and qualitative
synthesis. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of AI
platforms for M2 occlusion detection were 64\% (95\% CI, 53 to 74\%) and
97\% (95\% CI, 84 to 100\%), respectively. The area under the curve
(AUC) in the SROC curve was 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.83). Conclusion:
The current performance of the AI-based algorithm makes it more suitable
as an adjunctive confirmatory tool rather than as an independent one for
M2 occlusions. With the rapid development of such algorithms, it is

article,"Optimized Artificial Neural Network Techniques to Improve Cybersecurity
of Higher Education Institution","Education acts as an important part of economic growth and improvement
in human welfare. The educational sectors have transformed a lot in
recent days, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is an
effective part of the education field. Almost every action in university
and college, right from the process from counselling to admissions and
fee deposits has been automated. Attendance records, quiz, evaluation,
mark, and grade submissions involved the utilization of the ICT.
Therefore, security is essential to accomplish cybersecurity in higher
security institutions (HEIs). In this view, this study develops an
Automated Outlier Detection for CyberSecurity in Higher Education
Institutions (AOD-CSHEI) technique. The AOD-CSHEI technique intends to
determine the presence of intrusions or attacks in the HEIs. The
AOD-CSHEI technique initially performs data pre-processing in two stages
namely data conversion and class labelling. In addition, the Adaptive
Synthetic (ADASYN) technique is exploited for the removal of outliers in
the data. Besides, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with deep neural
network (DNN) model is used for the classification of data into the
existence or absence of intrusions in the HEIs network. Finally, the SSA
is utilized to effectually adjust the hyper parameters of the DNN
approach. In order to showcase the enhanced performance of the AOD-CSHEI
technique, a set of simulations take place on three benchmark datasets
and the results reported the enhanced efficiency of the AOD-CSHEI
technique over its compared methods with higher accuracy of 0.9997.","AL-Ghamdi, Abdullah Saad AL-Malaise and Ragab, Mahmoud and Sabir, Maha

Concept Maps to Implement Online Learning in an Artificial Intelligence
Course","Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and
open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to
help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain
massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to
identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This
study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with
dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining
technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In
previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this
study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real
time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial
intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students'
learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine.
The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group
searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this
agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The
learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better
than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the
experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control
group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the
learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater

article,Drop-Out Prediction in Higher Education Among B40 Students,"Malaysia citizens are categorized into three different income groups
which are the Top 20 Percent (T20), Middle 40 Percent (M40), and Bottom
40 Percent (B40). One of the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan
(11MP) is to elevate the B40 household group towards the middle-income
society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households belong to
this group. The government of Malaysia has widened access to higher
education for the B40 group in an effort to reduce the gaps in
socioeconomics and to improve their living standards. Statistical data
shows that since 2013, a yearly intake of students in bachelor's degree
programs in Malaysia's public universities amounts to more than 85,000.
Despite this huge number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate,
including students from low-income family background. Data mining
approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used
effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping out
in general education. However, machine learning related works on student
attrition in Malaysia's higher education is generally lacking.
Therefore, in this research, three machine learning models were
developed using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural
Network algorithm in order to classify attrition among B40 students in
bachelor's degree programs in Malaysia's public universities.
Comparative performance analysis between the three models indicates that
the Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student
attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the other two
models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with the
value of 95.93\%, 97.10\%, 81.26\% and 88.50\%, respectively.
Nevertheless, there is a statistically significant difference in
performance between the Random Forest model and Decision Tree model but

angiography (CCTA) is promising for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk
stratification, but time consuming and requires high expertise.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to CCTA for comprehensive CAD
assessment may overcome these limitations. We hypothesized AI aided
analysis allows for rapid, accurate evaluation of vessel morphology and
stenosis. Methods: This was a multi-site study of 232 patients
undergoing CCTA. Studies were analyzed by FDA-cleared software service
that performs AI-driven coronary artery segmentation and labeling, lumen
and vessel wall determination, plaque quantification and
characterization with comparison to ground truth of consensus by three
L3 readers. CCTAs were analyzed for: \% maximal diameter stenosis,
plaque volume and composition, presence of high-risk plaque and Coronary
Artery Disease Reporting \& Data System (CAD-RADS) category. Results: AI
performance was excellent for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value and negative predictive value as follows:

article,"Artificial Intelligence for Aortic Pressure Waveform Analysis During
Coronary Angiography Machine Learning for Patient Safety","OBJECTIVES This study developed a neural network to perform automated
pressure waveform analysis and allow real-time accurate identification
of damping.
BACKGROUND Damping of aortic pressure during coronary angiography must
be identified to avoid serious complications and make accurate coronary
physiology measurements. There are currently no automated methods to do
this, and so identification of damping requires constant monitoring,
which is prone to human error.
METHODS The neural network was trained and tested versus core laboratory
expert opinions derived from 2 separate datasets. A total of 5,709
aortic pressure waveforms of individual heart beats were extracted and
classified. The study developed a recurrent convolutional neural network
to classify beats as either normal, showing damping, or artifactual.
Accuracies were reported using the opinions of 2 independent core
laboratories.
RESULTS The neural network was 99.4\% accurate (95\% confidence
interval: 98.8\% to 99.6\%) at classifying beats from the testing
dataset when judged against the opinions of the internal core
laboratory. It was 98.7\% accurate (95\% confidence interval: 98.0\% to
99.2\%) when judged against the opinions of an external core laboratory
not involved in neural network training. The neural network was 100\%
sensitive, with no beats classified as damped misclassified, with a
specificity of 99.8\%. The positive predictive and negative predictive
values were 98.1\% and 99.5\%. The 2 core laboratories agreed more
closely with the neural network than with each other.

MethodsWe used publicly available long short term memory (LSTM) deep
learning basic architecture that can track temporal changes and
relationships in real-time video, to create an algorithm for ultrasound
video analysis. The algorithm was trained on public domain IVC
ultrasound videos to improve its ability to recognize changes in varied
ultrasound video. A total of 220 IVC videos were used, 10\% of the data
was randomly used for cross correlation during training. Data were
augmented through video rotation and manipulation to multiply effective
training data quantity. After training, the algorithm was tested on the
50 new IVC ultrasound video obtained from public domain sources and not
part of the data set used in training or cross validation. Fleiss' kappa
was calculated to compare level of agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
and between deep learning algorithm and POCUS experts.
ResultsThere was very substantial agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
with kappa = 0.65 (95\% CI = 0.49-0.81). Agreement between experts and
algorithm was moderate with kappa = 0.45 (95\% CI = 0.33-0.56).
ConclusionsOur algorithm showed good agreement with POCUS experts in
visually estimating degree of IVC collapsibility that has been shown in
previously published studies to differentiate fluid responsive from
fluid unresponsive septic shock patients. Such an algorithm could be
adopted to run in real-time on any ultrasound machine with a video

the medications taken by patients. The effect of a specific medication
on osseointegration can be easily investigated using traditional
systematic reviews. However, assessment of all known medications

when done manually. The objective of this study was to develop a machine
learning algorithm to automatically map the literature assessing the
effect of medications on osseointegration. Datasets of articles
classified manually were used to train a machine-learning algorithm

described the effect of 31 different drugs on osseointegration. This
approach achieved an accuracy of 95\%, and compared to manual screening,
it reduced the workload by 93\%. The systematic mapping revealed that
the treatment outcomes of osseointegrated medical devices could be

different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We
learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density
of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most
relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In
addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction

adoption of such services becomes widespread. Accordingly, this study
developed and validated a predictive model that explains the role of
students' information management (i.e. retrieve, store, share, and
apply) practices in predicting their attitudes toward using the MCC
services for educational purposes. This study validated the model by the
complementary use of machine learning algorithms alongside a classical
SEM-based approach based on data collected from 308 undergraduate
students. The SEM results indicated that the students' information
management (i.e. retrieve, store, share, and apply) practices were
significantly associated with their attitudes, which were significantly
associated with the behavioral intentions. The structural model
explained a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral
intentions. Likewise, the classifier model suggested that the students'
information management practices and attitudes predicted the behavioral
intentions. Further, the applied algorithms predicted the behavioral
intentions with an accuracy of more than 72\% in most cases. Thereby,
the study extended an original theory (TRA) into the MCC area by using a
multi-analytical approach. The findings implied that employing the MCC
services for personal information management should be supported and
encouraged in the higher education by designing authentic learning
environments and scaffolding the students in using such services.","Arpaci, Ibrahim","Information management; Cloud computing; Artificial intelligence;

article,"Perception of university students towards the use of artificial
intelligence-generated voice in explainer videos","Explainer videos are on the rise, not just for marketing or sales
purposes to highlight a product or business idea in a compelling and
efficient way, but also as a learning tool to enhance instruction at all
levels of learning. But though videos are increasingly part of education
today, video production can be a time-consuming process, and this can be
a barrier for educators who may not all be well-versed in or able to
dedicate significant amounts of time to the creation of effective,
interesting explainer videos that support their educational content. If
it is possible to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voices for
voice-overs in explainer videos, this would speed up the video creation
process by allowing the creators to bypass the need to record a human -
whether it is the video's creator or a separate actor - speaking the
lines. This study explores the potential of AI-generated voices in
explainer videos aimed at university students, specifically
investigating students' responses to AI-generated voices by looking at
whether they respond positively to the voice and whether there is any
Uncanny Valley effect of revulsion towards it. The findings are based on
a pilot study for university students, where participants were exposed
to a set of explainer videos using different voice-overs (human voice,
speaker notes app, and an AI-generated voice) and their responses
recorded via a questionnaire with questions modified from Ho and
Macdorman, 2010; Kroger et al., 2019; and Kuhne et al., 2020. The
results show a preference for the more human-like voice-overs and no
substantial negative perception of the AI-generated voices that were
more human-like, indicating that AI-generated voices could potentially
be more widely used in explainer videos at institutions of higher
education.","Kit, Leong Wai and Yuin-Y, Chew and Zulkifli, Balqis and Nie, Kho Suet",AI voice; e-learning; explainer video; voice-over; voice characteristics,No data,2023,13

algorithm for CT on image quality and potential dose reduction: A
phantom study","Background Recently, computed tomography (CT) manufacturers have
developed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithms to compensate
for the limitations of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms, such as
image smoothing and the spatial resolution's dependence on contrast and
dose levels. Purpose To assess the impact of an artificial intelligence
deep-learning reconstruction (AI-DLR) algorithm on image quality and
dose reduction compared with a hybrid IR algorithm in chest CT for
different clinical indications. Methods Acquisitions on the CT American
College of Radiology (ACR) 464 and CT Torso CTU-41 phantoms were
performed at five dose levels (CTDIvol: 9.5/7.5/6/2.5/0.4 mGy) used for
chest CT conditions. Raw data were reconstructed using filtered
backprojection, two levels of IR (iDose(4) levels 4 (i4) and 7 (i7)),
and five levels of AI-DLR (Precise Image; Smoother, Smooth, Standard,
Sharp, Sharper). Noise power spectrum (NPS), task-based transfer
function, and detectability index (d `) were computed: d `-modeled
detection of a soft tissue mediastinal nodule (low-contrast soft tissue
chest nodule within the mediastinum {[}LCN]), ground-glass opacity
(GGO), or high-contrast pulmonary (HCP) lesion. The subjective image
quality of chest anthropomorphic phantom images was independently
evaluated by two radiologists. They assessed image noise, image
smoothing, contrast between vessels and fat in the mediastinum for
mediastinal images, visual border detection between bronchus and lung
parenchyma for parenchymal images, and overall image quality using a
commonly used four- or five-point scale. Results From Standard to
Smoother levels, on average, the noise magnitude decreased (for all dose
levels: -66.3\% +/- 0.5\% for mediastinal images and -63.1\% +/- 0.1\%
for parenchymal images), the average NPS spatial frequency decreased
(for all dose levels: -35.3\% +/- 2.2\% for mediastinal images and
-13.3\% +/- 2.2\% for parenchymal images), and the detectability (d `)
of the three lesions increased. The opposite pattern was found from
Standard to Sharper levels. From Smoother to Sharper levels, the spatial
resolution increased for the low-contrast polyethylene insert and the
opposite for the high-contrast air insert. Compared to the i4 used in
clinical practice, d ` values were higher using Smoother (mean for all
dose levels: 338.7\% +/- 29.4\%), Smooth (103.4\% +/- 11.2\%), and
Standard (34.1\% +/- 6.6\%) levels for the LCN on mediastinal images and
Smoother (169.5\% +/- 53.2\% for GGO and 136.9\% +/- 1.6\% for HCP) and
Smooth (36.4\% +/- 22.1\% and 24.1\% +/- 0.9\%, respectively) levels for
parenchymal images. Radiologists considered the images satisfactory for
clinical use at these levels, but adaptation to the dose level of the
protocol is required. Conclusion With AI-DLR, the smoothest levels
reduced the noise and improved the detectability of chest lesions but
increased the image smoothing. The opposite was found with the sharpest
levels. The choice of level depends on the dose level and type of image:
mediastinal or parenchymal.","Greffier, Joel and Si-Mohamed, Salim and Frandon, Julien and Loisy,

article,Explainable Student Agency Analytics,"Several studies have shown that complex nonlinear learning analytics
(LA) techniques outperform the traditional ones. However, the actual
integration of these techniques in automatic LA systems remains rare
because they are generally presumed to be opaque. At the same time, the
current reviews on LA in higher education point out that LA should be
more grounded to the learning science with actual linkage to teachers
and pedagogical planning. In this study, we aim to address these two
challenges. First, we discuss different techniques that open up the
decision-making process of complex techniques and how they can be
integrated in LA tools. More precisely, we present various global and
local explainable techniques with an example of an automatic LA process
that provides information about different resources that can support
student agency in higher education institutes. Second, we exemplify
these techniques and the LA process through recently collected student
agency data in four courses of the same content taught by four different
teachers. Altogether, we demonstrate how this process-which we call
explainable student agency analytics-can contribute to teachers'
pedagogical planning through the LA cycle.","Saarela, Mirka and Heilala, Ville and Jaaskela, Paivikki and

article,"Estimation of density and compressibility factor of natural gas using
artificial intelligence approach","Natural gas density is commonly measured by Coriolis density meters and
gas chromatographs, both of which are used to calculate the natural gas
mass flow rate. In this study, two networks are proposed to predict the
density and compressibility factor of natural gas. The first network
(N-1) uses temperature, pressure and Joule Thomson (JT) coefficient of
natural gas as input variables and density of natural gas is selected to
be the target. This network is proposed to predict the natural gas
density at natural gas pressure drop stations (CGSs). For this network,
the gas mixture compositions are unnecessary. The second network (N-2)
is proposed based on the pseudo reduced temperature and pressure as
input variables that the network by using these two variables can
predict the density and compressibility factor of natural gas. This
model needs the gas mixture compositions. For these targets, a novel
idea based on artificial intelligence is used. Five models of artificial
intelligence are implemented that are fuzzy inference system (FIS),
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), ANFIS optimized with
genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), multilayer feed-forward neural network
(MLFFNN) and group method of data handling (GMDH). The results
demonstrated that the ANFIS-GA and GMDH model performed better than the
FIS, MLFFNN and ANFIS models. For N-1, root mean square error (RMSE) for
ANFIS-GA and GMDH models were obtained as 0.2405 and 0.2042 (kg/m(3)),
respectively. For N-2 (compressibility factor), the value of RMSE for
ANFIS-GA and GMDH models consecutively was achieved 0.0061 and 0.0054.
Also, for N-2 (density), RMSE for ANFIS-GA and GMDH models was taken

inproceedings,Automating space allocation in higher education,"The allocation of office space in any large institution is usually a
problematical issue, which often demands a substantial amount of time to
perform manually. The result of this allocation affects the lives of
whoever makes use of the space. In the higher education sector in the
UK, space is becoming an increasingly precious commodity. Student
numbers have risen significantly over the last few years and as a
result, university departments have grown in size. In addition,
universities have come under increasing financial pressure to ensure
that space is utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible.
However, space utilization is only one issue to take into account when
measuring whether or not a particular allocation is of a sufficient high
quality. The problem of space allocation is further complicated by the
fact that no standard procedure is practiced throughout the higher
education sector. Most institutions have their own standards and
requirements, which are often very different to other institutions.
Different levels of authority control the domains of rooms and resources
in different institutions. The most common situation is where a central
university office controls a number of faculties, each managing a number
of departments. This paper will focus specifically on applying
optimization methods to departmental room allocation for non-residential
space in the higher education sector. It will look at the use of three
methods (hill-climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) to
automatically generate solutions to the problem. The processing power of
computers and the repetitive search nature of this problem means that
there is great potential for the automation of this process. The paper
will conclude by discussing and comparing these methods and showing how
they cope with a highly constrained problem.","Burke, EK and Varley, DB",space allocation; hill-climbing; simulated annealing; genetic algorithms,No data,1999,8

article,"E-learning in higher education during COVID-19: evidence from blackboard
learning system","Purpose - The blackboard learning system is an online platform designed
for e-learning employed by higher education institutes like universities
that facilities students to continue learning and educational
activities. This study explores the determinants that affect students'
acceptance and use of Blackboard learning system (BLS) in Pakistan
utilizing the modified UTAUT framework with social isolation as an
additional variable.
Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted, and
the study gathered 494 university students' responses in Pakistan as
participants. The collected data were interpreted applying PLS-SEM
version 3.2.3 software.
Findings - The study's findings exhibited that PE, EE, FC and SI are the
prime determinants influencing the intention and use of BLS in Pakistani
universities. Hedonic motivation and social isolation interact
differently between UTAUT variables and use intention. The results
verify the suitability of the applied theory in the background of the
study.
Research limitations/implications - However, the findings highlight the
present understanding of BLS use from the learners' aspect, but the
study's limitation cannot be evaded. The study respondents belonged to a
specific region of Pakistan (Karachi) that might influence the
usefulness of the outcomes. Other factors categorized as the
environmental, system and organizational elements were not part of the
study that may also differentiate the BLS acceptance. The model was
extended by including the social isolation, but the effect is
insignificant yet positive; therefore, it is required to evaluate the
model differently, such as the organizational aspect, for future
research. Moreover, the ethnic factors that vary in emerging and
developed economies may provide different explanations; therefore, they
can be incorporated in future studies. Likewise, the variables such as
hedonic motivation need to be emphasized more by examining and
evaluating its effect on students' education performance in the future.
Practical implications - The outcome of the study suggests some
implications. At first, being the modified framework UTAUT2 application
makes the collaboration appropriate according to the current phenomena
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to the higher education
region to analyze the acceptance of e-learning systems. Educational
institutions within Pakistan would emphasize enhancing students'
accomplishment by improving the interface and the blackboard learning
system workability. Hence, learners' effectiveness in learning would be
escalated; they would be encouraged to accomplish study objectives using
BLS, particularly when they consider it easy to use and a useful
platform for e-learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, enhancing the
e-learning system in the context of the effort demands to be required to
utilize BLS should be the foremost objective as learners would be
motivated to accept the technology if they consider it simple,
convenient, and user-friendly to adopt. Thus, the benefits of using BLS
during this situation when universities are not operational will make
students adaptable to change in the prospect. Learners will accept the
model of online education, even if the universities become operational.
However, it can increase the rate of earnings and revenue for
universities as they can enroll in online and regular classes.
Therefore, it is suggested that higher education management should
create a resilient online platform by which facilitators can communicate
with learners without any obstacles.
Social implications - Hence, it is recommended to introduce the online
short course, qualification, certified courses and integrated coursework
with international ventures and ongoing classes. Numerous learners
continue their studies along with the job. Therefore, it is suggested to
introduce online programs for those learners. Another benefit would be
that it offers an integrated platform for sharing knowledge. BLS offers
to maintain the complete information in one place, and learners can see
them as per their convenience based on their availability. This reduces
the burden on administration related to keeping the educational material
and resource in various files. Thus, it also reduces the expense of
universities. It is suggested to emphasize encouraging the use of BLS
through an effective plan that can assist in execution and help learners
identify the technology features rather than to face difficultly to
accept the change. Moreover, the acceptance of BLS for educational
purposes verifies that other learning events can occur on the online
platform. Thus, it is recommended to promote the origin of the online
atmosphere and the initiation of other events. Globally, dynamics are
changing frequently and continuously and are moving towards artificial
intelligence systems; the circumstances are suitable for promoting
online educational platforms' acceptance by incorporating it with the
current educational arrangement.
Originality/value - The study provides recommendations for the research
to be conducted to explore the modified framework in different regions
and boundaries to evaluate the effect of other factors on adopting
e-learning platforms.","Raza, Syed Ali and Qazi, Zubaida and Qazi, Wasim and Ahmed, Maiyra","Social isolation; Hedonic motivation; Online learning; Blackboard

participatory privacy protection algorithm-II, for determining optimal
privacy settings of an Ambient Assisted Living App and handling its
runtime Permission requests, respectively. We demonstrated the working
of these algorithms using a case study. We have also compared the
proposed approach with state-of-the-art privacy management schemes for

Artificial intelligence (AI) role is obvious in catering to the
automation of these systems. Intelligent systems are used in a number of
fields like healthcare, agriculture, mining, complex decision making,
automatic vehicle, educational institutions, and many others. Approaches
of AI and 5G have transformed the learning and teaching approaches
through earlier and smooth access to contents of education. Learning
processes are now made productive and interactive through which students
can enhance their skills of language through communication with AI-based
machine agents instead of native speakers. Various platforms are
available which has the capabilities to understand the uncontrollable
power of students and can ultimately create content according to the
level of students. In order to undertake the aim of teaching
effortlessly and flawlessly, the teachers should make use of AI-based

article,"Threefold Optimized Forecasting of Electricity Consumption in Higher
Education Institutions","Energy management benefits both consumers and utility companies alike.
Utility companies remain interested in identifying and reducing energy
waste and theft, whereas consumers' interest remain in lowering their
energy expenses. A large supply-demand gap of over 6 GW exists in
Pakistan as reported in 2018. Reducing this gap from the supply side is
an expensive and complex task. However, efficient energy management and
distribution on demand side has potential to reduce this gap
economically. Electricity load forecasting models are increasingly used
by energy managers in taking real-time tactical decisions to ensure
efficient use of resources. Advancement in Machine-learning (ML)
technology has enabled accurate forecasting of electricity consumption.
However, the impact of computation cost afforded by these ML models is
often ignored in favour of accuracy. This study considers both accuracy
and computation cost as concurrently significant factors because
together they shape the technology environment as well as create
economic impact. Thus, a three-fold optimized load forecasting model is
proposed which includes (1) application specific parameters selection,
(2) impact of different dataset granularities and (3) implementation of
specific data preparation. It deploys and compares the widely used
back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF)
models for the prediction of electricity consumption of buildings within
a university. In addition to the temporal and historical power
consumption date as input parameters, the study also embeds weather data
as well as university operational calendars resulting in improved
performance. The outcomes are indicative that the granularity i.e. the
scale of details in data, and set of reduced and full input parameters
impact performance accuracies differently forANNandRF models.

article,"Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering: Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities, and Threats","Chemical engineers rely on models for design, research, and daily
decision-making, often with potentially large financial and safety
implications. Previous efforts a few decades ago to combine artificial
intelligence and chemical engineering for modeling were unable to
fulfill the expectations. In the last five years, the increasing
availability of data and computational resources has led to a resurgence
in machine learning-based research. Many recent efforts have facilitated
the roll-out of machine learning techniques in the research field by
developing large databases, benchmarks, and representations for chemical
applications and new machine learning frameworks. Machine learning has
significant advantages over traditional modeling techniques, including
flexibility, accuracy, and execution speed. These strengths also come
with weaknesses, such as the lack of interpretability of these black-box
models. The greatest opportunities involve using machine learning in
time-limited applications such as real-time optimization and planning
that require high accuracy and that can build on models with a
self-learning ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become
more intelligent over time. The greatest threat in artificial
intelligence research today is inappropriate use because most chemical
engineers have had limited training in computer science and data
analysis. Nevertheless, machine learning will definitely become a
trustworthy element in the modeling toolbox of chemical engineers. (C)

article,"Artificial intelligence-supported applications in head and neck cancer
radiotherapy treatment planning and dose optimisation","Introduction: The aim of this review is to describe how various
AI-supported applications are used in head and neck cancer radiotherapy
treatment planning, and the impact on dose management in regards to
target volume and nearby organs at risk (OARs).
Methods: Literature searches were conducted in databases and publisher
portals Pubmed, Science Direct, CINAHL, Ovid, and ProQuest to peer
reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2021. Results: Out of 464
potential ones, ten articles covering the topic were selected. The
benefit of using deep learning-based methods to automatically segment
OARs is that it makes the process more efficient producing clinically
acceptable OAR doses. In some cases automated treatment planning systems
can outperform traditional systems in dose prediction.
Conclusions: Based on the selected articles, in general AI-based systems
produced time savings. Also, AI-based solutions perform at the same
level or better than traditional planning systems considering
auto-segmentation, treatment planning and dose prediction. However,
their clinical implementation into routine standard of care should be
carefully validated
Implications to practice: AI has a primary benefit in reducing treatment
planning time and improving plan quality allowing dose reduction to the
OARs thereby enhancing patients' quality of life. It has a secondary
benefit of reducing radiation therapists' time spent annotating thereby
saving their time for e.g. patient encounters. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

article,"Current Clinical Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Radiology
and Their Best Supporting Evidence","Purpose: Despite tremendous gains from deep learning and the promise of
artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to improve diagnosis and save
costs, there exists a large translational gap to implement and use AI
products in real-world clinical situations. Adoption of standards such
as Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for
Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis, Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials, and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging
is increasing to improve the peer-review process and reporting of AI
tools. However, no such standards exist for product-level review.
Methods: A review of clinical trials showed a paucity of evidence for
radiology AI products; thus, the authors developed a 10-question
assessment tool for reviewing AI products with an emphasis on their
validation and result dissemination. The assessment tool was applied to
commercial and open-source algorithms used for diagnosis to extract
evidence on the clinical utility of the tools.
Results: There is limited technical information on methodologies for
FDA-approved algorithms compared with open-source products, likely
because of intellectual property concerns. Furthermore, FDA-approved
products use much smaller data sets compared with opensource AI tools,
because the terms of use of public data sets are limited to academic and
noncommercial entities, which precludes their use in commercial
products.
Conclusions: Overall, this study reveals a broad spectrum of maturity
and clinical use of AI products, but a large gap exists in exploring
actual performance of AI tools in clinical practice.","Tariq, Amara and Purkayastha, Saptarshi and Padmanaban, Geetha Priya and

possible solution. Classroom Assets or knowledge on the historical
patterns in the classroom data which prevails in a traditional classroom
can be collected via an IoT system that uses sensors to generate a huge

symptoms as a physician when making a diagnostic prediction.Keypoints
Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML)
in the context of primary health care, despite its considerable
potential to aid in clinical work. This novel research sheds light on
the diagnostic accuracy of ML in a clinical context, as well as the
interpretation of its predictions. If the vast potential of ML is to be
utilized in primary health care, its performance, safety, and inner
workings need to be understood by clinicians.","Ellertsson, Steindor and Loftsson, Hrafn and Sigurdsson, Emil L.","General practice; artificial intelligence; primary headache disorders;

article,"Missed Incidental Pulmonary Embolism: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence
to Assess Prevalence and Improve Quality Improvement Opportunities","Purpose: Incidental pulmonary embolism (IPE) can be found on body CT.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using
artificial intelligence to identify missed IPE on a large number of CT
examinations. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all
single-phase chest, abdominal, and pelvic (CAP) and abdominal and pelvic
(AP) CT examinations performed at a single center over 1 year, for
indications other than identification of PE. Proprietary visual
classification and natural language processing software was used to
analyze images and reports from all CT examinations, followed by a
two-step human adjudication process to classify cases as true positive,
false positive, true negative, or false negative. Descriptive statistics
were assessed for prevalence of IPE and features (sub segmental versus
central, unifocal versus multifocal, right heart strain or not) of
missed IPE. Interrater agreement for radiologist readers was also
calculated. Results: A total of 11,913 CT examinations (6,398 CAP, 5,515
AP) were included. Thirty false-negative examinations were identified on
CAP (0.47\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.32\%-0.67\%) and
nineteen false-negative studies on AP (0.34\%; 95\% CI, 0.21\%-0.54\%)
studies. During manual review, readers showed substantial agreement for
identification of IPE on CAP (K = 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.86) and nearly
perfect agreement for identification of IPE on AP (K = 0.86; 95\% CI,
0.76-0.97). Forty-nine missed IPEs (0.41\%; 95\% CI, 0.30\%0.54\%) were
ultimately identified, compared with seventy-nine IPEs (0.66\%; 95\% CI,
0.53\%-0.83\%) identified at initial clinical interpretation.
Conclusions: Artificial intelligence can efficiently analyze CT
examinations to identify potential missed IPE. These results can inform
peer-review efforts and quality control and could potentially be
implemented in a prospective fashion.\& nbsp; J Am Coll Radiol

for Estimating a Travel Time Task","With the rapid development of the Internet, the nextgeneration network
(5G) has emerged. 5G can support a variety of new applications, such as
the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of
Vehicles. Most of these new applications depend on deep learning

based on deep learning pose numerous security problems. For example,
deep learning is susceptible to a well-designed input sample formed by
adding small perturbations to the original sample. This well-designed
input with small perturbations, which are imperceptible to humans, is
called an adversarial example. An adversarial example is similar to a
truth example, but it can render the deep learning model invalid. In
this article, we generate adversarial examples for spatiotemporal data.
Based on the travel time estimation (TTE) task, we use two
methods-white-box and blackbox attacks-to invalidate deep learning

successfully attack the deep learning model and thus that AI security is

intelligence in medical imaging","Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised in
medical imaging systems and processes, and radiographers must embrace
this advancement. This study aimed to investigate perceptions,
knowledge, and expectations towards integrating AI into medical imaging
amongst a sample of radiographers and determine the current state of AI
education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online
quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted
over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information,
participants' perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI
and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential
statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results:
A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64\% correctly
identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer
(37\%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and
deep learning. The majority of participants (83\%) agreed they were
excited about the advancement of AI, though a level of apprehensiveness
remained amongst 29\%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with
only 8\% of participants having received AI teachings in their
pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes
towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may
stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI
training within the community. Greater educational programs focusing on
AI principles are required to help increase European radiography
workforce engagement and involvement in AI technologies. Implications
for practice: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of
European based radiographers on AI in radiography to help facilitate the
embracement of AI technology and convey the need for AI-focused

field of life. Nowadays, it is seen that millions of data are recorded
continuously, and a large amount of data accumulation has occurred.
Although data accumulation increases exponentially, the number of

Although we live in the information age, it is more accurate to say that
we live in the data age. By using stored and accumulated data, it is
becoming increasingly essential to reveal meaningful relationships and
trends and to make predictions for the future. It is important to
analyze the data obtained from the education process and to evaluate the
success of the students and the factors affecting success. These
analyses may also contribute to future training activities. In this
study, a data set, including socio-demographic variables of students
enrolled in distance education at Hitit University, was used. The
authors estimated the success of the students with demographic and
social variables such as age, gender, city, family income, family
education level. The primary purpose is to provide students with
information about their estimated academic achievement at the beginning
of the process. Thus, at the beginning of the education process,
students' success can be increased by informing the students who are
predicted to be unsuccessful. Diversification and enhancement of this
data may also support other decision-making mechanisms in the training
process. Additionally, the factors affecting students' academic success
were researched, and the students' educational outcomes were evaluated.

Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few
cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy
Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.
Methods In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6
hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation,
and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene
parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the
validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS
and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the
Clopper-Pearson method. Results The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS
were 0.977 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and
0.990 (95\% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.988),
0.978 (95\% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95\% CI = 0.987 to 0.994)

article,"Development of a field artificial intelligence triage tool: Confidence
in the prediction of shock, transfusion, and definitive surgical therapy
in patients with truncal gunshot wounds","BACKGROUND In-field triage tools for trauma patients are limited by
availability of information, linear risk classification, and a lack of
confidence reporting. We therefore set out to develop and test a machine
learning algorithm that can overcome these limitations by accurately and
confidently making predictions to support in-field triage in the first
hours after traumatic injury. METHODS Using an American College of
Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program-derived database of truncal
and junctional gunshot wound (GSW) patients (aged 16-60 years), we
trained an information-aware Dirichlet deep neural network (field
artificial intelligence triage). Using supervised training, field
artificial intelligence triage was trained to predict shock and the need
for major hemorrhage control procedures or early massive transfusion
(MT) using GSW anatomical locations, vital signs, and patient
information available in the field. In parallel, a confidence model was
developed to predict the true-class probability (scale of 0-1),
indicating the likelihood that the prediction made was correct, based on
the values and interconnectivity of input variables. RESULTS A total of
29,816 patients met all the inclusion criteria. Shock, major surgery,
and early MT were identified in 13.0\%, 22.4\%, and 6.3\% of the
included patients, respectively. Field artificial intelligence triage
achieved mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
0.89, 0.86, and 0.82 for prediction of shock, early MT, and major
surgery, respectively, for 80/20 train-test splits over 1,000 epochs.
Mean predicted true-class probability for errors/correct predictions was
0.25/0.87 for shock, 0.30/0.81 for MT, and 0.24/0.69 for major surgery.
CONCLUSION Field artificial intelligence triage accurately identifies
potential shock in truncal GSW patients and predicts their need for MT
and major surgery, with a high degree of certainty. The presented model
is an important proof of concept. Future iterations will use an
expansion of databases to refine and validate the model, further adding
to its potential to improve triage in the field, both in civilian and
military settings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic, Level III.","Nederpelt, Charlie J. and Mokhtari, Ava K. and Alser, Osaid and

and identification of semantic text patterns with a view to automatising
the web search and assessment of professionally oriented texts used to
train students at foreign language departments of higher education
institutions of mineral resource development profile. The work provides
an overview of relevant AI methods that may be employed to perform the
tasks mentioned above and analyses a number of similar works. It offers
a structure of patterns that can be used to find relevant research

article,"A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Model for Predicting the Strength of
Foam-Cemented Paste Backfill","Foam-cemented paste backfill (FCPB) has become a trend to solve the
problem of roof-contacted filling. In order to solve the time-consuming
and labor-intensive disadvantages of laboratory uniaxial compressive
strength (UCS) tests, a hybrid artificial intelligence model which
combines random forest (RF) algorithm and grid search optimizer (GSO)
was proposed for FCPB strength prediction. Moreover, the effects of
foaming agent on cement hydration and pore structure characteristics
were studied. The results showed that GSO can effectively tune the
hyper-parameters of the proposed GSO-RF model and the developed model is
an efficient and accurate tool to predict the UCS for FCPB. Though the
foaming agent will not change the influence trend of cement-tailings
ratio, solid content and curing time, the influence degree will be
weakened by the foaming agent. The ranking of the relative importance of
influencing variables is: cement-tailings ratio > curing time > foaming
agent dosage > solid content. In addition, the foaming agent has no
significant effect on the hydration of cement. The foaming agent mainly
changes the strength by changing the pore structure characteristics
(especially the large pore volume). This research can provided some
guidance for developing UCS prediction model for FCPB.","Qiu, Jingping and Guo, Zhenbang and Li, Long and Zhang, Shiyu and Zhao,

article,"Digital image analysis in breast pathology-from image processing
techniques to artificial intelligence","Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in women worldwide.
In recent decades, earlier diagnosis and better adjuvant therapy have
substantially improved patient outcome. Diagnosis by histopathology has
proven to be instrumental to guide breast cancer treatment, but new
challenges have emerged as our increasing understanding of cancer over
the years has revealed its complex nature. As patient demand for
personalized breast cancer therapy grows, we face an urgent need for
more precise biomarker assessment and more accurate histopathologic
breast cancer diagnosis to make better therapy decisions. The
digitization of pathology data has opened the door to faster, more
reproducible, and more precise diagnoses through computerized image
analysis. Software to assist diagnostic breast pathology through image
processing techniques have been around for years. But recent
breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) promise to fundamentally
change the way we detect and treat breast cancer in the near future.
Machine learning, a subfield of AI that applies statistical methods to
learn from data, has seen an explosion of interest in recent years
because of its ability to recognize patterns in data with less need for
human instruction. One technique in particular, known as deep learning,
has produced groundbreaking results in many important problems including
image classification and speech recognition. In this review, we will
cover the use of AI and deep learning in diagnostic breast pathology,

article,"Analytical Study on Student Progression in Higher Education During and
Post COVID-19","The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the education sector
to extensively use digital technologies in imparting education and in
students' assessment. The integration of Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT) has been put to the test. With the use of ICT,
flexible education is an upcoming option to assist uniform, accessible,
and innovative educational systems. While learning in such a covid
scenario technical constraints, use of appropriate devices,
uninterrupted network and bandwidth have created challenges in student
progression and the teaching-learning process. The goal of this research
is to determine the impact of digital technology on student growth and
to investigate the factors that influence it. The usage of digital
technology in teaching/learning before and amidst the spread of pandemic
have been compared to appropriately assess the implications of these
unique educational circumstances in student progression. The study's
goal is to determine how digital technology affects student performance.
Secondary data was used in conjunction with survey methods. Researchers
have also studied the various platforms used in imparting education as
well as in assessment. A questionnaire with self-reporting instruments
and a scale for describing student progress through continuous
evaluation with ICT was used. Evidence from secondary data reveals that
despite facing many challenges during covid, students have shown
considerable improvements and progress. Though the exams used artificial
intelligence-based algorithms for proctoring, there exist loopholes and
huge dependency on tools required and bandwidth to support efficient
assessment during the examination. The suggestions and recommendations
are made to enhance current online teaching methods to reach a larger

article,"Enhancing Trust in Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Explainable
Artificial Intelligence: Incorporating Local Post Hoc Explanations for a
Glass-box Model","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cognitive dysfunction
among older people worldwide, making it nearly impossible for them to
carry out their daily lives. Due to the inherent characteristics of
Alzheimer's disease and its impact on the brain, timely intervention is
crucial to delay its onset and mitigate its progression. Currently, the
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease often occurs at a stage where it is too
late for effective prevention measures, allowing the disease to cause
significant damage to the brain. The use of machine learning and deep
learning models is critical for the classification of demented and
non-demented cases, but most highly accurate models are non-linear and
less transparent, not revealing the logic behind the predictions.
Therefore, incorporating interpretability components into the models
will make them more transparent and trustworthy. This study is aimed to
develop appropriate diagnostic methods capable of assessing Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the early stage of Alzheimer's disease that
occurs before the irreversible loss of neurons. Methods: Explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to AI systems that can provide
explanations for their decisions or predictions. In the context of AD
classification, explainable AI systems aim to provide insights into the
features or characteristics of the model used to make a prediction. This
XAI provides a mechanism to understand and interpret the basis of a
model's predictions which is more important for improving the trust in
the system and its results. As such, a non-linear neural network is
employed in this work to distinguish between demented and non-demented
cases while local post hoc explanations are incorporated to make it a
glass-box model using the XAI techniques such as SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations
(LIME). Results: The application of LIME provided valuable insights into
the impact of various factors on predictions. Notably, factors such as
CDR, Age, and ASF aligned with clinical knowledge and proved
instrumental in predicting dementia cases. Conversely, features like
nWBV, MMSE, and eTIV adversely affected the predictions, highlighting
their significance in identifying non-demented cases. Similarly,
exploring SHAP values yielded a comprehensive understanding of the
decision-making process employed by the model in detecting Alzheimer's
disease. Conclusion: Through the utilization of explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, this study endeavors to develop a dependable
and transparent technique for early detection, monitoring, and
personalized interventions in the realm of Alzheimer's disease.","Varghese, Abraham and George, Ben and Sherimon, Vinu and Al Shuaily,

article,"Evaluation of postgraduate academic performance using artificial
intelligence models","Institutions of higher learning are currently facing the challenging
task of attracting new students who can effectively meet their diverse
academic demands. With these demands come the need for those
institutions to develop strategies that can enhance students' learning
experiences at various educational levels. Predicting the academic
success at an early stage would allow academic institutions to develop
specific enrolment guidelines while avoiding poor performance. The main
purpose of this study was to predict the academic performance of
students, their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in particular, at
postgraduate levels (e.g., master's degree), using and comparing
different machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work uses a real
dataset of 635 master's students collected from the college of graduate
studies of a reputable private university in Malaysia. The predictive
model's goodness-of-fitness is determined using the coefficient of
determination R-2, which indicates the percentage of the variance in the
dependent variables. The mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error
(MAE) are used to evaluate the model's performance, by identifying
discrepancies between the predicted CGPA and the actual CGPA. Of the six
different ML models applied, our results showed that the artificial
neural network (ANN) model has the best performance, achieving 89\% of
the variation in the CGPA of the students, with a training error of only
0.06 CGPA points and a prediction error of 0.08 CGPA points. The
Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with squared exponential kernel
algorithm achieved 71\% of the CGPA variation. The model achieved 0.095
CGPA points for both training and evaluation errors. Exploring other
variables such as research activities, marital status, and living
conditions would have improved the overall accuracy of the proposed ML
models. Therefore, future investigations should focus on predicting the
academic performance of larger numbers of postgraduates (i.e., PhD and
Masters) using different predictive variables and AI models. (C) 2022

article,Digital University - Issues and Trends in Romanian Higher Education,"Today's students, known as digital natives, are living a paradox.
Although they grew up with technology, there are many studies which
underline that students' digital skills are not what they might seem.
Thus, even if they are more familiar than professors or parents with
functions and options available on the most used social networks and
applications like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube etc., they
still need ``support with some areas of digital practice, particularly
in an academic context{''} (JISC, 2015).
But are these perceptions / expectations of students' digital skills
based on reality? Moreover, what should we do as their professors?
Firstly, we should not forget that not all students have equal access to
digital resources. Some of them need to be trained more
concretely/effectively and most of them need to refine and update their
digital skills and competencies in order to become more employable,
ready to cope with the digital jobs of the future.
Secondly, they need to benefit from staff well equipped with digital
skills, who can design and deliver courses with technology integrated,
able to pass on the relevant digital skills to their students and
colleagues.
Thirdly, they need a proper and adequate digital environment.
Given this approach, we formulated our research questions as follows:
What are the challenges in creating the right environments for digital
learning?
What are institutions doing in order to equip professors with digital
skills?
The aim of the present paper is to review existing evidence on what a
digital university means. What is it? What actions should we take
towards becoming a digital university? Thus, we conducted a small-scale
study within the Romanian higher education space in order to investigate
the aforesaid research questions and to emphasize what concrete steps,
actions, responsibilities and measures should be taken to drive forward
a digital university vision.","Grosseck, Gabriela and Malita, Laura and Bran, Ramona",Digital University; Digital Teacher; Digital Competences; Digital Skills,No data,2019,15
article,"Influencing factors, prediction and prevention of depression in college
students: A literature review","The high prevalence of depression among college students has a strong
negative impact on individual physical and mental health, academic
development, and interpersonal communication. This paper reviewed the
extant literature by identifying nonpathological factors related to
college students' depression, investigating the methods of predicting
depression, and exploring nonpharmaceutical interventions for college
students' depression. The influencing factors of college students'
depression mainly fell into four categories: biological factors,
personality and psychological state, college experience, and lifestyle.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the severity of
depression among college students worldwide and poses grave challenges
to the prevention and treatment of depression, given that the
coronavirus has spread quickly with high infection rates, and the
pandemic has changed the daily routines of college life. To predict and
measure mental health, more advanced methods, such as machine algorithms
and artificial intelligence, have emerged in recent years apart from the
traditional commonly used psychological scales. Regarding
nonpharmaceutical prevention measures, both general measures and
professional measures for the prevention and treatment of college
students' depression were examined in this study. Students who
experience depressive disorders need family support and personalized
interventions at college, which should also be supplemented by
professional interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and
online therapy. Through this literature review, we insist that the
technology of identification, prediction, and prevention of depression
among college students based on big data platforms will be extensively
used in the future. Higher education institutions should understand the
potential risk factors related to college students' depression and make
more accurate screening and prevention available with the help of
advanced technologies.","Liu, Xin-Qiao and Guo, Yu-Xin and Zhang, Wen-Jie and Gao, Wen-Juan","Depression; Prediction; Prevention; Artificial intelligence; Big data;

article,"Artificial pigs in space: Using artificial intelligence and artificial
life techniques to design animal housing","Computer simulations have been used by us since the early 1970s to gain
an understanding of the spacing and movement patterns of confined
animals. The work has progressed from the early stages, in which we used
randomly positioned points, to current investigations of animats
(computer-simulated animals), which show low levels of learning via
artificial neural networks. We have determined that 1) pens of equal
floor area but of different shape result in different spatial and
movement patterns for randomly positioned and moving animats; 2) when
group size increases under constant density, freedom of movement
approaches an asymptote at approximately six animats; 3) matching the
number of animats with the number of corners results in optimal freedom
of movement for small groups of animats; and 4) perimeter positioning
occurs in groups of animats that maximize their distance to first- and
second-nearest neighbors. Recently, we developed animats that move,
compete for social dominance, and are motivated to obtain resources
(food, resting sites, etc.). We are currently developing an animat that
learns its behavior fi om the spatial and movement data collected on
live pigs. The animat model is then used to pretest pen designs,
followed by new pig spatial data fed into the animat model, resulting in
a new pen design to be tested, and the steps are repeated. We believe
that methodologies from artificial-life and artificial intelligence can
contribute to the understanding of basic animal behavior principles, as
well as to the solving of problems in production agriculture in areas
such as animal housing design.","Stricklin, WR and de Bourcier, P and Zhou, JZ and Gonyou, HW",animal housing; group behavior; computer simulation,No data,1998,5

potential utility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
techniques as aids for radiologists to solve specific radiological
challenges. The decision-making process, the establishment of specific
clinical or radiological targets, the profile of the different
professionals involved in the development of AI solutions, and the
relation with partnerships and stakeholders are only some of the main
issues that have to be faced and solved prior to starting the
development of radiological AI solutions. Among all the players in this

scientists is essential for a successful collaborative work. There are
specific skills that are inherent to radiological and medical training
that are critical for identifying anatomical or clinical targets as well
as for segmenting or labelling lesions. These skills would then have to

article,"Deep learning model to detect significant aortic regurgitation using
electrocardiography","Background: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common heart disease, with a
relatively high prevalence of 4.9\% in the Framingham Heart Study.
Because the prevalence increases with advancing age, an upward shift in
the age distribution may increase the burden of AR. To provide an
effective screening method for AR, we developed a deep learning-based
artificial intelligence algorithm for the diagnosis of significant AR
using electrocardiography (ECG). Methods: Our dataset comprised 29,859
paired data of ECG and echocardiography, including 412 AR cases, from
January 2015 to December 2019. This dataset was divided into training,
validation, and test datasets. We developed a multi-input neural network
model, which comprised a two-dimensional convolutional neural network
(2D-CNN) using raw ECG data and a fully connected deep neural network
(FC-DNN) us-ing ECG features, and compared its performance with the
performances of a 2D-CNN model and other machine learning models. In
addition, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)
to identify which parts of ECG waveforms had the most effect on
algorithm decision making. Results: The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of the multi-input model (0.802; 95\% CI,
0.762-0.837) was significantly greater than that of the 2D-CNN model
alone (0.734; 95\% CI, 0.679- 0.783; p < 0.001) and those of other
machine learning models. Grad-CAM demonstrated that the multi -input
model tended to focus on the QRS complex in leads I and aVL when
detecting AR. Conclusions: The multi-input deep learning model using

article,Ontological Approach: Knowledge Representation and Knowledge Extraction,"The application of artificial intelligence algorithms for data analysis,
characteristics, and metrics of scientific information resources are
considered. In this paper, we discuss how metrics are related to
assessment of scientific publication components and whether metrics are
related to fundamental knowledge. It was noted that the characteristics
of professional scientific activity are evaluated on the basis of
metrics that are not related to the knowledge characteristics. The
problem of knowledge extraction was studied on the basis of data
verification by means of logical evidence-based schemes specified in the
knowledge ontology. Properties of the modern stage of development of the
knowledge space as a resource of artificial intelligence were noted. The
transformation of artificial intelligence tasks into a new digital age
was also analyzed. The insufficient use of artificial intelligence and
machine learning methods in scientific bibliographic databases was
emphasized, where quantitative scientometric indicators prevailed.

article,"Systematic review of research design and reporting of imaging studies
applying convolutional neural networks for radiological cancer diagnosis","Objectives To perform a systematic review of design and reporting of
imaging studies applying convolutional neural network models for
radiological cancer diagnosis. Methods A comprehensive search of PUBMED,
EMBASE, MEDLINE and SCOPUS was performed for published studies applying
convolutional neural network models to radiological cancer diagnosis
from January 1, 2016, to August 1, 2020. Two independent reviewers
measured compliance with the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in
Medical Imaging (CLAIM). Compliance was defined as the proportion of
applicable CLAIM items satisfied. Results One hundred eighty-six of 655
screened studies were included. Many studies did not meet the criteria
for current design and reporting guidelines. Twenty-seven percent of
studies documented eligibility criteria for their data (50/186, 95\% CI
21-34\%), 31\% reported demographics for their study population (58/186,
95\% CI 25-39\%) and 49\% of studies assessed model performance on test
data partitions (91/186, 95\% CI 42-57\%). Median CLAIM compliance was
0.40 (IQR 0.33-0.49). Compliance correlated positively with publication
year (rho = 0.15, p = .04) and journal H-index (rho = 0.27, p < .001).
Clinical journals demonstrated higher mean compliance than technical
journals (0.44 vs. 0.37, p < .001). Conclusions Our findings highlight
opportunities for improved design and reporting of convolutional neural

article,"Abnormal Behavior Recognition in Classroom Pose Estimation of College
Students Based on Spatiotemporal Representation Learning","Artificial intelligence and fifth generation (5G) technology are widely
adopted to evaluate the classroom poses of college students, with the
help of campus video surveillance equipment. To ensure the effective
learning in class, it is important to detect and intervene in abnormal
behaviors like sleeping and using cellphones in time. Based on
spatiotemporal representation learning, this paper presents a deep
learning algorithm to evaluate classroom poses of college students.
Firstly, feature engineering was adopted to mine the moving trajectories
of college students, which were used to determine student distribution
and establish a classroom prewarning system. Then, k-means clustering
(KMC) was employed for cluster analysis on different student groups, and
identify the features of each group. For a specific student group, the
classroom surveillance video was decomposed into several frames; the
edge of each frame was extracted by edge detection algorithm, and
imported to the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN).
Experimental results show that our algorithm is 5\% more accurate than
the benchmark three-dimensional CNN (C3D), making it an effective tool
to recognize abnormal behaviors of college students in class.","Xie, Yunfang and Zhang, Su and Liu, Yingdi","artificial intelligence; college students; pose estimation;

artificial intelligence-learned pattern recognition for rapid automated
ejection fraction","Objectives We sought to test the hypothesis that a novel 2-dimensional
echocardiographic image analysis system using artificial
intelligence-learned pattern recognition can rapidly and reproducibly
calculate ejection fraction (EF).
Background Echocardiographic EF by manual tracing is time consuming, and
visual assessment is inherently subjective.
Methods We studied 218 patients (72 female), including 165 with abnormal
left ventricular (LV) function. Auto EF incorporated a database trained
on > 10,000 human EF tracings to automatically locate and track the LV
endocardium from routine grayscale digital cineloops and calculate EF in
15 s. Auto EF results were independently compared with manually traced
biplane Simpson's rule, visual EF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
in a subset.
Results Auto EF was possible in 200 (92\%) of consecutive patients, of
which 77\% were completely automated and 23\% required manual editing.
Auto EF correlated well with manual EF (r = 0.98; 6\% limits of
agreement) and required less time per patient (48 +/- 26 s vs. 102 21 s;
p < 0.01). Auto EF correlated well with visual EF by expert readers (r =
0.96; p < 0.001), but interobserver variability was greater (3.4 +/-
2.9\% vs. 9.8 +/- 5.7\%, respectively; p < 0.001). Visual EF was less
accurate by novice readers (r = 0.82; 19\% limits of agreement) and
improved with trainee-operated Auto EF (r = 0.96; 7\% limits of
agreement). Auto EF also correlated with MRI EF (n = 21) (r = 0.95; 12\%
limits of agreement), but underestimated absolute volumes (r = 0.95;
bias of -36 +/- 27 ml overall).
Conclusions Auto EF can automatically calculate EF similarly to results
by manual biplane Simpson's rule and MRI, with less variability than
visual EF, and has clinical potential.","Cannesson, Maxime and Tanabe, Masaki and Suffoletto, Matthew S. and

article,"Programming and Computational Thinking in Mathematics Education An
Integration Towards AI Awareness","Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday interactions
with pervasive digital systems. This development increasingly calls for
citizens to have a basic understanding of programming and computational
thinking (PCT). Accordingly, countries worldwide are implementing
several approaches to integrate critical elements of PCT into K-9
education. However, these efforts are confronted by difficulties that
the PCT concepts are for students to grasp from purely theoretical
perspectives. Recent literature indicates that the playful nature is
particularly important when novices from both both early and higher
education are to learn AI. These playful activities are characterised by
setting a scene where PCT concepts such as algorithms, data processing,
and simulations are meant to draw on to understand better how AI is
integrated into our everyday digital life. This discussion paper
analyses playful PCT resources developed around the game
rock-paper-scissors developed in the UK and Denmark. Resources from
these countries are interesting starting points since both have been or
are in the process of integrating PCT as part of the K-9 curriculum. The
central discussion raised by the paper, is the nature of the integration
between mathematics and PCT in these tasks. These resources provide

Exams via Learning Management System Without using a Webcam","Cheating attempts in educational assessments have long been observed.
Because students today are characterized by their great digital
intelligence, this negative conduct has intensified throughout the
emergency remote teaching time. First, this article discusses the most
innovative methods for combating cheating throughout the online

Networks for Cheating Detection System (CNNCDS) is presented.. The
proposed solution has the advantage of not requiring the use of a

exam sessions, and prevents internet browsing during exams. The
K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) has been adopted as a classifier while the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for exploratory data
analysis and for making predictive models. The CNNCDS was learned,
tested, and validated by using data extracted from a face-to-face exam
session. its main output is a binary students' classification in
real-time (normal or abnormal). The CNNCDS surpasses the fundamental
classifiers Multi-class Logistic Regression (MLR), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) in
terms of mean accuracy (98.5\%). Furthermore, it accurately detected
screen pictures in an acceptable processing time, with a sensitivity
average of 99.8 percent and a precision average of 1.8 percent. This
strategy has been shown to be successful in minimizing cheating in

article,"Diversification of educational services in the conditions of industry
4.0 on the basis of AI training","Purpose The purpose of the paper is to determine the perspectives of
diversification of educational services in the conditions of industry
4.0 on the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) training, determine the
consequences of this process for academic and teaching staff and to
develop recommendations for its practical implementation.
Design/methodology/approach The methods of horizontal, trends and
regression analysis are used for studying social consequences of digital
modernization of the markets of higher education (for academic and
teaching staff). The research is performed by the example of modern
Russia on the basis of the statistical data of Federal State Statistics
Service and the International Telecommunication Union. The timeframe of
the research covers academic years 2000/2001-2018/2019. Findings It is
determined that digital modernization of the sphere of higher education
stimulates the reduction of the universities' need for academic and
teaching staff and growth of their unemployment. However, further
digital modernization of economy on the basis of breakthrough
technologies of industry 4.0 will lead to creation of a new type of
educational services that are provided within entrepreneurship of
universities - AI training of business. This will ensure development of
university entrepreneurship (and reduction of dependence of universities
on state financing), as well as growth of the employment opportunities
for experts (academic and teaching staff) in the sphere of AI, which
will not depend on the number of students, but will be connected to
demand for AI training from digital business. Originality/value The role
of AI training in the structure of production business processes of a
university in the conditions of industry 4.0 is determined. The
necessity for state stimulation of development of digital business in
the modern economic systems is substantiated. It is shown that
government has to pay close attention to the issues of support in the
sphere of AI and mass distribution of their results. Because of this, it
will be possible to control social risks in the sphere of higher
education.","Bogoviz, Aleksei V. and Lobova, Svetlana V. and Karp, Marina V. and

article,Stereo matching algorithm based on deep learning: A survey,"The development of stereo matching algorithm is still one of the
challenging problems, especially in illposed regions. Hence, this
article presents a survey on the algorithm frameworks related to the
stereo matching algorithm. Based on the early survey that had been
conducted, two major frameworks available in current stereo matching
algorithm development, they are traditional and artificial intelligence
(AI) frameworks. Most of the traditional methods are very low accuracy
compared to the AI-based approach. This can be observed in the standard

article,"Bayesian Inference and Dynamic Neural Feedback Promote the Clinical
Application of Intelligent Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis","Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of infant death. An
artificial intelligence (AI)-based CHD diagnosis network (CHDNet) is an
echocardiogram video-based binary classification model that judges
whether echocardiogram videos contain heart defects. Existing CHDNets
have shown performances comparable to or even better than medical
experts, but their unreliability on cases outside of the training set
has become the main bottleneck for their deployment. This is a common
problem for most AI-based diagnostic approaches. Here, to overcome this
challenge, we present two essential mechanisms-Bayesian inference and
dynamic neural feedback-to respectively measure and improve the
diagnostic reliability of AI. The former easily makes the neural network
output its reliability instead of a single prediction result, while the
latter is a computational neural feedback cell that allows the neural
network to feed knowledge from the output layer back to the shallow
layers and enables the neural network to selectively activate relevant
neurons. To evaluate the effectiveness of these two mechanisms, we
trained CHDNets on 4151 echocardiogram videos containing three common
CHD defects and tested them on an internal test set of 1037
echocardiogram videos and an external set of 692 videos that were newly
collected from other cardiovascular imaging devices. Each echocardiogram
video corresponds to a unique patient and a unique visit. We demonstrate
on various neural network architectures how the reliability obtained by
Bayesian inference interprets and quantifies the significant performance
difference between internal and external test sets of neural networks,
and how the devised feedback cell helps the neural networks to maintain
high accuracy and reliability, despite the input being corrupted by
noise or when using an external test set.\& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

article,"The use of deep learning towards dose optimization in low-dose computed
tomography: A scoping review","Introduction: Low-dose computed tomography tends to produce lower image
quality than normal dose computed tomography (CT) although it can help
to reduce radiation hazards of CT scanning. Research has shown that
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially deep learning can
help enhance the image quality of low-dose CT by denoising images. This
scoping review aims to create an overview on how AI technologies,
especially deep learning, can be used in dose optimisation for low-dose
CT.
Methods: Literature searches of ProQuest, PubMed, Cinahl, ScienceDirect,
EbscoHost Ebook Collection and Ovid were carried out to find research
articles published between the years 2015 and 2020. In addition, manual
search was conducted in SweMed+, SwePub, NORA, Taylor \& Francis Online
and Medic.
Results: Following a systematic search process, the review comprised of
16 articles. Articles were organised according to the effects of the
deep learning networks, e.g. image noise reduction, image restoration.
Deep learning can be used in multiple ways to facilitate dose
optimisation in low-dose CT. Most articles discuss image noise reduction
in low-dose CT.
Conclusion: Deep learning can be used in the optimisation of patients'
radiation dose. Nevertheless, the image quality is normally lower in
low-dose CT (LDCT) than in regular-dose CT scans because of smaller
radiation doses. With the help of deep learning, the image quality can
be improved to equate the regulardose computed tomography image quality.
Implications to practice: Lower dose may decrease patients' radiation
risk but may affect the image quality of CT scans. Artificial
intelligence technologies can be used to improve image quality in
low-dose CT scans. Radiologists and radiographers should have proper
education and knowledge about the techniques used. (C) 2021 The College

article,"Automated segmentation of the larynx on computed tomography images: a
review","The larynx, or the voice-box, is a common site of occurrence of Head and
Neck cancers. Yet, automated segmentation of the larynx has been
receiving very little attention. Segmentation of organs is an essential
step in cancer treatment-planning. Computed Tomography scans are
routinely used to assess the extent of tumor spread in the Head and Neck
as they are fast to acquire and tolerant to some movement. This paper
reviews various automated detection and segmentation methods used for
the larynx on Computed Tomography images. Image registration and deep
learning approaches to segmenting the laryngeal anatomy are compared,
highlighting their strengths and shortcomings. A list of available
annotated laryngeal computed tomography datasets is compiled for
encouraging further research. Commercial software currently available
for larynx contouring are briefed in our work. We conclude that the lack
of standardisation on larynx boundaries and the complexity of the
relatively small structure makes automated segmentation of the larynx on
computed tomography images a challenge. Reliable computer aided
intervention in the contouring and segmentation process will help
clinicians easily verify their findings and look for oversight in

common types of cardiomyopathies leading to heart failure. Accurate
diagnostic classification of different types of cardiomyopathies is
critical for precision medicine in clinical practice. In this study, we
hypothesized that machine learning (ML) can be used as a novel
diagnostic approach to analyze cardiac transcriptomic data for
classifying clinical cardiomyopathies. RNA-Seq data of human left
ventricle tissues were collected from 41 DCM patients, 47 ICM patients,
and 49 nonfailure controls (NF) and tested using five ML algorithms:
support vector machine with radial kernel (svmRadial), neural networks
with principal component analysis (pcaNNet), decision tree (DT), elastic
net (ENet), and random forest (RF). Initial ML classifications achieved
similar to 93\% accuracy (svmRadial) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 82\%
accuracy (RF) for NF vs. ICM, and similar to 80\% accuracy (ENet and
svmRadial) for DCM vs. ICM. Next, 50 highly contributing genes (HCGs)
for classifying NF and DCM, 68 HCGs for classifying NF and ICM, and 59
HCGs for classifying DCM and ICM were selected for retraining ML models.
Impressively, the retrained models achieved similar to 90\% accuracy
(RF) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 90\% accuracy (pcaNNet) for NF vs. ICM,
and similar to 85\% accuracy (pcaNNet and RF) for DCM vs. ICM. Pathway
analyses further confirmed the involvement of those selected HCGs in
cardiac dysfunctions such as cardiomyopathies, cardiac hypertrophies,

continuing education, peer learning, quality assurance, and
multidisciplinary patient care. The objective of this study was to
determine whether modern deep-learning language-modeling techniques
could reliably match pathology reports to pertinent radiology reports.
Methods: The recently proposed Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for
Text Classification methodology was used. Two hundred thousand radiology
and pathology reports were used for adaptation to the
radiology-pathology space. One hundred thousand candidate
radiology-pathology pairs, evenly split into match and no-match
categories, were used for training the final binary classification
model. Matches were defined by a previous-generation artificial

sensitivity, and 73.7\% accuracy. For comparison, the previous
methodology, which was intentionally designed to be specific at the
expense of sensitivity, had 98.0\% specificity, 65.1\% sensitivity, and
73.2\% accuracy.
Conclusions: Modern deep-learning language-modeling approaches are
promising for radiology-pathology correlation. Because of their rapid
adaptation to underlying training labels, these models advance previous
artificial intelligence work in that they can be continuously improved
and tuned to improve performance and adjust to user and site-level

Top pharmaceutical companies have adopted Al in different applications
within the pharma sector. Different Al models like Machine learning,
Artificial Neural Network, Deep Learning, robotics, and Natural Language
Processing are being used in pharmaceuticals and healthcare systems. The
Worldwide Al market is growing remarkably with a compound annual growth

article,Machine learning meets genome assembly,"Motivation: With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, the
study of the genetic composition of living organisms has become more
accessible for researchers. Several advances have been achieved because
of it, especially in the health sciences. However, many challenges which
emerge from the complexity of sequencing projects remain unsolved. Among
them is the task of assembling DNA fragments from previously unsequenced
organisms, which is classified as an NP-hard (nondeterministic
polynomial time hard) problem, for which no efficient computational
solution with reasonable execution time exists. However, several tools
that produce approximate solutions have been used with results that have
facilitated scientific discoveries, although there is ample room for
improvement. As with other NP-hard problems, machine learning algorithms
have been one of the approaches used in recent years in an attempt to
find better solutions to the DNA fragment assembly problem, although
still at a low scale.
Results: This paper presents a broad review of pioneering literature
comprising artificial intelligence-based DNA assemblers-particularly the
ones that use machine learning-to provide an overview of
state-of-the-art approaches and to serve as a starting point for further

article,"Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes
in head and neck cancer","Advances in technical radiotherapy have resulted in significant sparing
of organs at risk (OARs), reducing radiation-related toxicities for
patients with cancer of the head and neck (HNC). Accurate delineation of
target volumes (TVs) and OARs is critical for maximising tumour control
and minimising radiation toxicities. When performed manually,
variability in TV and OAR delineation has been shown to have significant
dosimetric impacts for patients on treatment. Auto-segmentation (AS)
techniques have shown promise in reducing both inter-practitioner
variability and the time taken in TV and OAR delineation in HNC.
Ultimately, this may reduce treatment planning and clinical waiting
times for patients. Adaptation of radiation treatment for biological or
anatomical changes during therapy will also require rapid re-planning;
indeed, the time taken for manual delineation currently prevents
adaptive radiotherapy from being implemented optimally. We are therefore
standing on the threshold of a transformation of routine radiotherapy
planning via the use of artificial intelligence. In this article, we
outline the current state-of-the-art for AS for HNC radiotherapy in
order to predict how this will rapidly change with the introduction of
artificial intelligence. We specifically focus on delineation accuracy
and time saving. We argue that, if such technologies are implemented
correctly, AS should result in better standardisation of treatment for
patients and significantly reduce the time taken to plan radiotherapy.

article,"Artificial intelligence in fracture detection: transfer learning from
deep convolutional neural networks","AIM: To identify the extent to which transfer learning from deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pre-trained on non-medical images,
can be used for automated fracture detection on plain radiographs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The top layer of the Inception v3 network was
re-trained using lateral wrist radiographs to produce a model for the
classification of new studies as either ``fracture{''} or ``no
fracture{''}. The model was trained on a total of 11,112 images, after
an eightfold data augmentation technique, from an initial set of 1,389
radiographs (695 ``fracture{''} and 694 ``no fracture{''}). The training
data set was split 80:10:10 into training, validation, and test groups,
respectively. An additional 100 wrist radiographs, comprising 50
``fracture{''} and 50 ``no fracture{''} images, were used for final
testing and statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)
for this test was 0.954. Setting the diagnostic cut-off at a threshold
designed to maximise both sensitivity and specificity resulted in values
of 0.9 and 0.88, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The AUC scores for this test were comparable to
state-of-the-art providing proof of concept for transfer learning from
CNNs in fracture detection on plain radiographs. This was achieved using
only a moderate sample size. This technique is largely transferable, and
therefore, has many potential applications in medical imaging, which may
lead to significant improvements in workflow productivity and in
clinical risk reduction. (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists.

large-scale data","Acute hypotensive episode (AHE) is a common serious postoperative
complication in ICU, which may raise multiple system failure (especially
of cardiac and respiratory kinds), and even cause death. Timely and
effective clinical intervention is obviously vital to the saving of
patients. AHE detection involves physiological time-series monitoring,
processing and prediction technologies, which can offer insights to
neuroscientists, biologists, and even provide support for clinicians.
This paper presents a hybrid artificial intelligence model combined with
CEEMDAN (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive
noise, a typical method for physiological signal decomposition), deep
learning, multiple gene expression programming and fuzzy expert system
for AHE detection. In this paper, the physiological signal is selected
from a benchmark dataset, for example MIMIC-II (Multiparameter
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II), which collects large scale
real patients' data for clinical research. In the hybrid model, a
typical signal decomposition method is employed for AHE signal
processing, and an autoencoder based deep neural network is established
for feature extraction. Finally, a reliable and explainable classifier
is presented by fusing gene expression programming and the fuzzy method.
Experimental results based on real data set demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art AHE detection methods by
achieving the prediction accuracy of 88.14\% in 2866 records. (c) 2020

pace in research laboratories both at academic institutions and in
industry. Important artificial intelligence (AI) tools for diagnostic
imaging include algorithms for disease detection and classification,
image optimization, radiation reduction, and workflow enhancement.
Although advances in foundational research are occurring rapidly,
translation to routine clinical practice has been slower. In August
2018, the National Institutes of Health assembled multiple relevant
stakeholders at a public meeting to discuss the current state of
knowledge, infrastructure gaps, and challenges to wider implementation.
The conclusions of that meeting are summarized in two publications that
identify and prioritize initiatives to accelerate foundational and
translational research in AI for medical imaging. This publication
summarizes key priorities for translational research developed at the
workshop including: (1) creating structured AI use cases, defining and
highlighting clinical challenges potentially solvable by AI; (2)
establishing methods to encourage data sharing for training and testing
AI algorithms to promote generalizability to widespread clinical
practice and mitigate unintended bias; (3) establishing tools for
validation and performance monitoring of AI algorithms to facilitate
regulatory approval; and (4) developing standards and common data
elements for seamless integration of AI tools into existing clinical
workflows. An important goal of the resulting road map is to grow an
ecosystem, facilitated by professional societies, industry, and
government agencies, that will allow robust collaborations between
practicing clinicians and AI researchers to advance foundational and

article,Blessing of dimensionality at the edge and geometry of few-shot learning,"In this paper we present theory and algorithms enabling classes of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to continuously and incrementally
improve with a priori quantifiable guarantees-or more specifically
remove classification errors-over time. This is distinct from
state-of-the-art machine learning, AI, and software approaches. The
theory enables building few-shot AI correction algorithms and provides
conditions justifying their successful application. Another feature of
this approach is that, in the supervised setting, the computational
complexity of training is linear in the number of training samples. At
the time of classification, the computational complexity is bounded by
few inner product calculations. Moreover, the implementation is shown to
be very scalable. This makes it viable for deployment in applications
where computational power and memory are limited, such as embedded
environments. It enables the possibility for fast on-line optimisation
using improved training samples. The approach is based on the
concentration of measure effects and stochastic separation theorems and
is illustrated with an example on the identification faulty processes in
Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling and with a case study on
adaptive removal of false positives in an industrial video surveillance
and analytics system.

discovery and screening in cancer. However, current studies have led to
little understanding of genotype mismatches in PDXs, leading to massive
economic losses. Here, we established PDX models from 53 lung cancer
patients with a genotype matching rate of 79.2\% (42/53). Furthermore,
17 clinicopathological features were examined and input in stepwise
logistic regression (LR) models based on the lowest Akaike information
criterion (AIC), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO)-LR, support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination
(SVM-RFE), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting and
categorical features (CatBoost), and the synthetic minority oversampling
technique (SMOTE). Finally, the performance of all models was evaluated
by the accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC), and F1 score in 100 testing groups. Two multivariable LR models
revealed that age, number of driver gene mutations, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, type of prior chemotherapy, prior
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, and the source of the sample
were powerful predictors. Moreover, CatBoost (mean accuracy = 0.960;
mean AUC = 0.939; mean F1 score = 0.908) and the eight-feature SVM-RFE
(mean accuracy = 0.950; mean AUC = 0.934; mean F1 score = 0.903) showed
the best performance among the algorithms. Meanwhile, application of the
SMOTE improved the predic-tive capability of most models, except
CatBoost. Based on the SMOTE, the ensemble classifier of single models
achieved the highest accuracy (mean = 0.975), AUC (mean = 0.949), and F1

article,"Integrating Artificial and Human Intelligence: A Partnership for
Responsible Innovation in Biomedical Engineering and Medicine","Historically, the term ``artificial intelligence{''} dates to 1956 when
it was first used in a conference at Dartmouth College in the US. Since
then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped
by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain,
scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of
performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into
artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the
human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms
has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still
markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly
because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it
has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal
utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context,
there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI).
Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and
addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand
deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically
developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best
understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug
discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from
AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert
review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to
traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not
only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that
are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include
digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of
health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt
diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with
consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for
integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to
replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such
expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible
innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from
prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of
automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on
scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.","Dzobo, Kevin and Adotey, Sampson and Thomford, Nicholas E. and Dzobo,

even forced humans to shift their life habits, including in the world of
education. The learning model must shift from the traditional
face-to-face pattern to a modern face-to-face pattern or an asynchronous
pattern with information technology-based applications. Blended learning
is one of the appropriate solutions to adjust the limited face-to-face
learning conditions. Blended learning can be done, for example, by
scheduling learning by dividing the number of participants by 50\% and
entering on a scheduled basis. However, the problem is that the time and
effort used are less efficient. Blended learning can also be done by
conducting learning simultaneously with 50\% of students in class and
the remaining 50\% through conferences. This concept will streamline the
time and effort used. However, the problem is that there is a gap in the
learning experience between students in class and students who do
learning via conference. This innovative blended learning system
framework is proposed to overcome these problems. The system built seeks
to present an online learning experience atmosphere so that it is
expected to be able to resemble an offline learning atmosphere. We

strawberry tongue and oral hairy leukoplakia with high classification

article,Data mining for ranking sorghum seed lots,"-The ranking of seed lots is a fundamental process for all companies in
the seed industry. This work aims to demonstrate data mining methods for
ranking sorghum seed lots during the seed processing through analysis of
quality control data. Germination and cold tests were performed to
verify the physiological quality of the lots. Seed samples from each lot
were evaluated in two moments: post-cleaning and finished product (ready
for marketing). The results after pre-processing totaled 188 rows of
data with six attributes, encompassing 150 lots accepted for marketing,
6 rejected, and 32 intermediate lots. The classifiers used were J48,
Random Forest, Classification Via Regression, Naive Bayes, Multilayer
Perceptron, and IBk. The Resample filter was used for adjustment of the
data. The k-fold technique was used for training, with ten folds. The
metrics of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-measure, and ROC Area were
used to verify the accuracy of the algorithms. The results obtained were
used to determine the best machine-learning algorithm. IBk and J48
presented the highest accuracy of data; the IBk technique presented the
best results. The Resample filter was essential for solving the data
imbalance problem. Sorghum seed lots can be classified with great
accuracy and precision through artificial intelligence and machine
learning technique.","Rocha, Luciana D. and Gadotti, Gizele I. and Bernardy, Ruan and

article,"Development of a light-weight deep learning model for cloud applications
and remote diagnosis of skin cancers","Skin cancer is among the 10 most common cancers. Recent research
revealed the superiority of artificial intelligence (AI) over
dermatologists to diagnose skin cancer from predesignated and cropped
images. However, there remain several uncertainties for AI in diagnosing
skin cancers, including lack of testing for consistency, lack of
pathological proof or ambiguous comparisons. Hence, to develop a
reliable, feasible and user-friendly platform to facilitate the
automatic diagnostic algorithm is important. The aim of this study was
to build a light-weight skin cancer classification model based on deep
learning methods for aiding first-line medical care. The developed model
can be deployed on cloud platforms as well as mobile devices for remote
diagnostic applications. We reviewed the medical records and clinical
images of patients who received a histological diagnosis of basal cell
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, seborrheic keratosis and
melanocytic nevus in 2006-2017 in the Department of Dermatology in
Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH). We used the deep
learning models to identify skin cancers and benign skin tumors in the
manner of binary classification and multi-class classification in the
KCGMH and HAM10000 datasets to construct a skin cancer classification
model. The accuracy reached 89.5\% for the binary classifications
(benign vs malignant) in the KCGMH dataset; the accuracy was 85.8\% in
the HAM10000 dataset in seven-class classification and 72.1\% in the
KCGMH dataset in five-class classification. Our results demonstrate that
our skin cancer classification model based on deep learning methods is a
highly promising aid for the clinical diagnosis and early identification
of skin cancers and benign tumors.","Huang, Hsin-Wei and Hsu, Benny Wei-Yun and Lee, Chih-Hung and Tseng,

article,"Risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety disorders in college
students: Stakeholder perspectives","The worldwide prevalence of anxiety disorders among college students is
high, which negatively affects countries, schools, families, and
individual students to varying degrees. This paper reviews the relevant
literature regarding risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety
disorders among college students from the perspectives of different
stakeholders. Risk factors at the national and societal levels include
class differences and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
College-level risk factors include the indoor environment design of the
college environment, peer relationships, student satisfaction with
college culture, and school functional levels. Family-level risk factors
include parenting style, family relationship, and parental level of
education. Individual-level risk factors include biological factors,
lifestyle, and personality. Among the intervention options for college
students' anxiety disorders, in addition to traditional cognitive
behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, psychological
counseling, and group counseling, digital mental health interventions
are increasingly popular due to their low cost, positive effect, and
convenient diagnostics and treatment. To better apply digital
intervention to the prevention and treatment of college students'
anxiety, this paper suggests that the different stakeholders form a
synergy among themselves. The nation and society should provide
necessary policy guarantees, financial support, and moral and ethical
supervision for the prevention and treatment of college students'
anxiety disorders. Colleges should actively participate in the screening
and intervention of college students' anxiety disorders. Families should
increase their awareness of college students' anxiety disorders and take
the initiative to study and understand various digital intervention
methods. College students with anxiety disorders should actively seek
psychological assistance and actively accept and participate in digital
intervention projects and services. We believe that in the future, the
application of methods such as big data and artificial intelligence to
improve digital interventions and provide individualized treatment plans
will become the primary means of preventing and treating anxiety
disorders among college students.","Liu, Xin-Qiao and Guo, Yu-Xin and Xu, Yi","College students; Anxiety disorders; Stakeholders; Digital intervention;

article,"Integrating human and machine intelligence in galaxy morphology
classification tasks","Quantifying galaxy morphology is a challenging yet scientifically
rewarding task. As the scale of data continues to increase with upcoming
surveys, traditional classification methods will struggle to handle the
load. We present a solution through an integration of visual and
automated classifications, preserving the best features of both human
and machine. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such a system through a
re-analysis of visual galaxy morphology classifications collected during
the Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2) project. We reprocess the top-level question of
the GZ2 decision tree with a Bayesian classification aggregation
algorithm dubbed SWAP, originally developed for the Space Warps
gravitational lens project. Through a simple binary classification
scheme, we increase the classification rate nearly 5-fold classifying
226 124 galaxies in 92 d of GZ2 project time while reproducing labels
derived from GZ2 classification data with 95.7 per cent accuracy. We
next combine this with a Random Forest machine learning algorithm that
learns on a suite of non-parametric morphology indicators widely used
for automated morphologies. We develop a decision engine that delegates
tasks between human and machine and demonstrate that the combined system
provides at least a factor of 8 increase in the classification rate,
classifying 210 803 galaxies in just 32 d of GZ2 project time with 93.1
per cent accuracy. As the Random Forest algorithm requires a minimal
amount of computational cost, this result has important implications for
galaxy morphology identification tasks in the era of Euclid and other
large-scale surveys.","Beck, Melanie R. and Scarlata, Claudia and Fortson, Lucy F. and Lintott,

article,"Are quiz-games an effective revision tool in Anatomical Sciences for
Higher Education and what do students think of them?","Recently, there has been an increased volume of pedagogical research and
practice of mobile learning (m-learning) and gameplay in education. This
paper presents the findings of a study that examined the effect on
achievement and explored student perception towards quiz-game play prior
to an anatomy assessment in first year Higher Education students.
Achievement data was collected over two academic years at all module
assessment (A1-A4) points. A1 was used as a baseline, showing no
difference between groups or years, A2 and A3 were comparable online
assessments done on the lower and upper limbs that followed the same
format; A4 was a viva-voce to assess the whole module learning. The
optional 15-minute quiz-gameplay intervention (G) using a mobile
application was initiated prior to A3, those students who chose not to
participate performed their traditional study routine; no other changes
to assessments were made resulting in a Gameplay and non-gameplay (G,
NG) group for each year. Students were invited to participate in an
online focus group (N = 84) and a sample undertook in-depth interviews
(N = 9) to gain qualitative data on their perceptions of the
intervention. Students who participated in the gameplay (G) group (N =
87) demonstrated a significant improvement in A3 compared to A2, and the
non-game play (NG) group (N = 164) a significant decrease. A thematic
analysis was undertaken on the focus group and interview data revealing
key aspects of quiz-gameplay as a learning tool. This paper offers
insight into the potential benefit of encouraging m-learning gameplay as
part of revision or learning for anatomy students. This information
could help educators and study support facilitate efficient revision
methods as well as initiate further research into the use of anatomy
gameplay to enhance the student learning experience.
Practitioner Notes
What is already known about this topic
Repeated and formative quizzing can help memory or knowledge retention.
Gameplay can help student engagement, learning and flow depending on the
game in question.
What this paper adds
Using mobile app-based quiz-games prior to an anatomy assessment can
improve student achievement.
Students tend to play mobile app-based quiz-games whilst commuting on
public transport, in their free time at home and at university.
Elements of mobile app-based quiz-games students identified as important
are that they are interactive, allow competition, are visually
appealing, provide instant feedback, are user friendly and are
facilitated by the teacher.
Implications for practice
Educators should encourage mobile app-based quiz-games to increase
short-term learning or revision.
Educators should facilitate mobile learning quiz-game opportunities to
encourage learning outside of the classroom.
Educators wanting to integrate mobile app-based quiz-games in their
classes should use the game attributes identified in this study.","Wilkinson, Kate and Dafoulas, George and Garelick, Hemda and Huyck,

machine learning and artificial intelligence, has markedly advanced over
the past years. DL techniques are being applied to assist medical
professionals and researchers in improving clinical diagnosis, disease
prediction and drug discovery. It is expected that DL will help to
provide actionable knowledge from a variety of `big data', including
metabolomics data. In this review, we discuss the applicability of DL to
metabolomics, while presenting and discussing several examples from
recent research. We emphasize the use of DL in tackling bottlenecks in
metabolomics data acquisition, processing, metabolite identification, as
well as in metabolic phenotyping and biomarker discovery. Finally, we
discuss how DL is used in genome-scale metabolic modelling and in
interpretation of metabolomics data. The DL-based approaches discussed
here may assist computational biologists with the integration,

article,"Establishment of smart education system in modern universities: concept,
technologies and challenges","The revolutionary digital transformations of society have led to the
need for formulating a smart higher education system, adequate to modern
conditions and based on the integrated use of intelligent digital
solutions. The paper substantiates that the creations of such systems
requires the solution of a whole complex of technological,
institutional, organizational, economic and managerial issues. In
accordance with this, the main tasks for the digital transformation of
universities are studied, including: the formation of basic digital
competencies, the incorporation of the digital agenda in research, the
substantial modernization of bachelor's and master's programs, as well
as programs of additional professional education. The paper identifies
various levels of introducing ICT into everyday practice and creating
the so-called ``smart education{''} system from the perspective of a
process approach. The article reveals the possibilities of applying the
paradigm of knowledge engineering for the intellectualisation of the
higher education system. The article also shows how the methods,
approaches and methodologies of knowledge engineering (KE) can be used
for the development of intelligent learning systems and smart tutoring
systems (STSs). It is proved that the convergence of artificial
intelligence (AI), web science (WS) and data science (DS) allows for the
creation of a new generation of web intelligent systems for all
educational and training tasks. One of the main objectives of this study
is to determine and explore the benefits and advantages of such
computational paradigms to increase the effectiveness and enhance the
efficiency of smart tutoring systems. The key advantages and challenges
of the use of modern intelligent systems and technologies in
universities are identified, taking into account the characteristics of
specific ICTs.Decisions are determined at different levels of the
economic hierarchy, the adoption of which is essential for the
institutionalisation of smart higher education systems.It is established

article,"Predicting Patient Demographics From Chest Radiographs With Deep
Learning","Background: Deep learning models are increasingly informing medical
decision making, for instance, in the detection of acute intracranial
hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism. However, many models are trained on
medical image databases that poorly represent the diversity of the
patients they serve. In turn, many artificial intelligence models may
not perform as well on assisting providers with important medical
decisions for underrepresented populations.Purpose: Assessment of the
ability of deep learning models to classify the self-reported gender,
age, self-reported ethnicity, and in-surance status of an individual
patient from a given chest radiograph.Methods: Models were trained and
tested with 55,174 radiographs in the MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR)
database. External validation data came from two separate databases, one
from CheXpert and another from a multihospital urban health care system
after institutional review board approval. Macro-averaged area under the
curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate performance of models. Code
used for this study is open-source and available at
https://github.com/ai-bias/cxr-bias, and pixelstopatients.com/models/
demographics.Results: Accuracy of models to predict gender was nearly
perfect, with 0.999 (95\% confidence interval: 0.99-0.99) AUC on
held-out test data and 0.994 (0.99-0.99) and 0.997 (0.99-0.99) on
external validation data. There was high accuracy to predict age and
ethnicity, ranging from 0.854 (0.80-0.91) to 0.911 (0.88-0.94) AUC, and
moderate accuracy to predict insurance status, with AUC ranging from
0.705 (0.60-0.81) on held-out test data to 0.675 (0.54-0.79) on external
validation data.Conclusions: Deep learning models can predict the age,
self-reported gender, self-reported ethnicity, and insurance status of a
patient from a chest radiograph. Visualization techniques are useful to
ensure deep learning models function as intended and to demonstrate
anatomical regions of interest. These models can be used to ensure that
training data are diverse, thereby ensuring artificial intelligence
models that work on diverse populations.","Adleberg, Jason and Wardeh, Amr and Doo, Florence X. and Marinelli,
