article,Toward a Framework for Teaching Artificial Intelligence to a Higher Education Audience,"Artificial Intelligence and its sub-disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant in numerous areas of academia as well as industry and can now be considered a core area of Computer Science [84]. The Higher Education sector are offering more courses in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence than ever before. However, there is a lack of research pertaining to best practices for teaching in this complex domain that heavily relies on both computing and mathematical knowledge. We conducted a literature review and qualitative study with students and Higher Education lecturers from a range of educational institutions, with an aim to determine what might constitute best practices in this area in Higher Education. We hypothesised that confidence, mathematics anxiety, and differences in student educational background were key factors here. We then investigated the issues surrounding these and whether they inhibit the acquisition of knowledge and skills pertaining to the theoretical basis of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This article shares the insights from both students and lecturers with experience in the field of AI and machine learning education, with the aim to inform prospective pedagogies and studies within this domain and move toward a framework for best practice in teaching and learning of these topics.","Allen, Becky and McGough, Andrew Stephen and Devlin, Marie","self-efficacy, Artificial intelligence, pedagogy",10.1145/3485062,2021,29
inproceedings,Improving Higher Education: Learning Analytics &amp; Recommender Systems Research,"An enduring issue in higher education is student retention to successful graduation. Studies in the U.S. report that average six-year graduation rates across higher-education institutions is 59% and have remained relatively stable over the last 15 years. For those that do complete a college degree, less than half complete within four-years. Requiring additional terms or leaving college without receiving a bachelor's degree has high human and monetary costs and deprives students from the economic benefits of a college credential (over $1 million in a lifetime and even higher in STEM fields). Moreover, when students do not succeed in graduating, local and national communities struggle to create an educated workforce. Estimates indicate that by 2020 over 64% of the jobs in the U.S. will require at least some post-secondary education. These challenges have been recognized by the U.S. National Research Council, which identified that there is a critical need to develop innovative approaches to enable higher-education institutions retain students, ensure their timely graduation, and are well-trained and workforce ready in their field of study. Failure to do so represents a significant problem as it deprives the U.S. of the highly skilled workforce that it needs to successfully compete in the modern world.This talk describes various efforts under way to develop ""Big Data"" methods to analyze in a comprehensive manner, the large and diverse types of education and learning-related data in order to improve undergraduate education. These methods are motivated by and are designed to address various interrelated issues that have a significant impact on college student success and include: (i) academic pathways towards successful and timely graduation from the student perspective; (ii) effective pedagogy by instructors; and (iii) retention and persistence of students from the institutional and advisor perspective. In addition, the talk will discuss areas in which research methods and approaches originally developed by the recommender systems community can be applied to this domain.","Karypis, George","student modeling, educational data mining, learning analytics",10.1145/3109859.3109870,2017,1
inproceedings,Psychology in Higher Education,"In recent years, with the vigorous development of China's economy, society and culture, ideological and political education and mental health education in colleges and universities are facing new challenges. Simple ideological and political education is no longer suitable for the development of young people. In the reality of education, due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of ideological and political work, and do not have the relevant psychological knowledge, many educators treat all problems, especially psychological problems as ideological and political problems, which will have a negative impact on the growth of young people. Therefore, we need to strengthen the effectiveness of ideological and political education, make ideological and political education more scientific, predictable and targeted. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of psychology in higher education. This paper first expounds the concept of psychology, and then introduces the application value of psychology in college education and teaching. This paper takes teachers from four colleges and universities in Sichuan province as the research object, uses questionnaire survey method, and makes statistics on 178 questionnaires. The analysis results show that 62% of the teachers realize the importance of psychology to education work.","Liu, Ruifeng and Wu, Min",No data,10.1145/3456887.3457003,2021,4

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence: Opportunities and Challenges for the Public Sector,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of technologies through which ""intelligent machines are gaining the ability to learn, improve and make calculated decisions in ways that enable them to perform tasks previously thought to rely solely on human experience, creativity, and ingenuity"" [2]. As stated in the 2018 the UN E-Government Survey, major technological developments in software and hardware have enhanced the advancement of AI and its potential impact on society. Increased data collection and usage are magnifying the learning process of computers and improving the quality of AI systems which are heavily data-dependent. On the one hand, AI holds the promise to be a catalyst in accelerating development and allowing developing countries to leapfrog over some traditional obstacles. On the other hand, it brings along challenges such as its impact on the workforce, the ethical implications of some of its applications, and the need for capacity-building which would essentially overhaul the kind of education required for the next generation. This working paper analyzes the above issues from a public sector angle and raises questions which should be considered by public administrators and those working on digital government development in particular. Moreover, the analyses are built on the 2018 United Nations E-Government Survey findings and the working paper is expected to be discussed in detail in the preparatory meetings leading to the next edition of the United Nations E-Government Survey.","Susar, Deniz and Aquaro, Vincenzo","E-government, Public Sector, Digital Government, Artificial Intelligence, Public Administration, Sustainable Development Goals",10.1145/3326365.3326420,2019,9
article,"Artificial Intelligence: The Societal Responsibility to Inform, Educate, and Regulate","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field; one that is mysterious to the general public. The mention of the word AI fills the imaginations of many with thoughts of talking robots, jobs being replaced, and possibly even the destruction of mankind. Perhaps imaginations are running wild due to, perhaps driven by the loose definition of AI as systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence that allows Hollywood to take some creative license. The experts in the field tend to work directly with AI and often for large companies, allowing for the imagination and news headlines to be where the public gets their information. Many wonder if this new technology is going to be an overall benefit to society or if it will bring unmitigated disaster. When the imagination runs wild, instead of understanding, news stories can perpetuate concerns and anxieties rather than hope and optimism.","Hilton, Alexander D.",No data,10.1145/3362077.3362088,2019,7
inproceedings,Simulation for Higher Education Sustainability: A Growing Institution Case Study,"We propose to reduce the complexity of sustainable development when we apply the simulation paradigm to a higher education institution by using a decomposition of both sustainability and the institution. It opens the possibilities to formalize their partial components and to identify many meaningful relationships among them. We formalized such relationships as a set of specific processes that we used in the created simulation case study. We consider the simulation models created within the case study as a tool to support higher education institution sustainability. In the simulation case study, we analyzed the faculty-students relationship described by the related institution admission processes. The simulation case study is connected with economic-constituent relations sustainability metrics. The simulation case study has been applied at a young fast growing higher education institution in the United States.","Kurkovsky, Anatoly","simulation case study, higher education, sustainable development",No data,2017,10

inproceedings,Introducing Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals with LearningML: Artificial Intelligence Made Easy,"This paper is a summary of the webinar hold on October 22nd at the “Computational thinking and robotics in education” track in which the LearningML project was presented. The LearningML project aims to bring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to children and people interested in acquiring knowledge on this subject in an easy way. AI has heavily irrupted in society and everyone is using, more or less consciously, application based on AI. Therefore, some kind of AI literacy is needed if we are to educate critically thinking citizens able to understand technologies that have a relevant impact on their lives. In this presentation we show how LearningML can help us to reach this goal trough programming applications based on Machine Learning (ML), the most prevalent subfield of AI today.","Rodr\'{\i}guez-Garc\'{\i}a, Juan David and Moreno-Le\'{o}n, Jes\'{u}s and Rom\'{a}n-Gonz\'{a}lez, Marcos and Robles, Gregorio","machine learning, assessment, computational thinking, K-12, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3434780.3436705,2021,3
article,Developing an Intelligent Cloud for Higher Education,"With rapid development in the IT world, technologies are becoming more dynamic and advanced. Today, technologies are changing with customer requirements. In the IT world, research is carried out to make technology better to meet the requirements that change with time. With the advancement in the IT world, online services have proliferated. Now a days, cloud computing is the hottest buzzword in the IT world. Cloud computing is not limited to the E-Governance and business worlds, but is also making a great impact in the education world. With growing demand for education, technologies and research, all universities and education institutions have their eyes on cloud computing. The main pillars of educational institutions are students, faculties, administrations and libraries. Faculty and students do research and need quality data while students of a particular field need a subject-oriented knowledge. Manually getting these kinds of data is time consuming as students depend on literature, books, different kind of software and hardware. With cloud computing in higher education, cost-effective measures can be taken to minimize the dependency on books, hardware and software. In this paper, we discuss how Artifical Intelligence based cloud computing in higher education will improve quality and ease the process of getting e-resources (software/hardware platform, storage etc.). This study will help in understanding effective cost-cutting measures. We also discuss how cloud computing in the library and administration will brighten the education prospects.","Yadav, Nikita and Khatri, Sujata and Singh, V.

inproceedings,"Explainable Artificial Intelligence, Lawyer's Perspective","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a research direction that was already put under scrutiny, in particular in the AI&amp;Law community. Whilst there were notable developments in the area of (general, not necessarily legal) XAI, user experience studies regarding such methods, as well as more general studies pertaining to the concept of explainability among the users are still lagging behind. This paper firstly, assesses the performance of different explainability methods (Grad-CAM, LIME, SHAP), in explaining the predictions for a legal text classification problem; those explanations were then judged by legal professionals according to their accuracy. Secondly, the same respondents were asked to give their opinion on the desired qualities of (explainable) artificial intelligence (AI) legal decision system and to present their general understanding of the term XAI. This part was treated as a pilot study for a more pronounced one regarding the lawyer's position on AI, and XAI in particular.","G\'{o}rski, \L{}ukasz and Ramakrishna, Shashishekar","grad-CAM, SHAP, survey, XAI, LIME, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3462757.3466145,2021,9

article,Quantum Mathematics in Artificial Intelligence,"In the decade since 2010, successes in artificial intelligence have been at the forefront of computer science and technology, and vector space models have solidified a position at the forefront of artificial intelligence. At the same time, quantum computers have become much more powerful, and announcements of major advances are frequently in the news. The mathematical techniques underlying both these areas have more in common than is sometimes realized. Vector spaces took a position at the axiomatic heart of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and this adoption was a key motivation for the derivation of logic and probability from the linear geometry of vector spaces. Quantum interactions between particles are modelled using the tensor product, which is also used to express objects and operations in artificial neural networks. This paper describes some of these common mathematical areas, including examples of how they are used in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in automated reasoning and natural language processing (NLP). Techniques discussed include vector spaces, scalar products, subspaces and implication, orthogonal projection and negation, dual vectors, density matrices, positive operators, and tensor products. Application areas include information retrieval, categorization and implication, modelling word-senses and disambiguation, inference in knowledge bases, and semantic composition. Some of these approaches can potentially be implemented on quantum hardware. Many of the practical steps in this implementation are in early stages, and some are already realized. Explaining some of the common mathematical tools can help researchers in both AI and quantum computing further exploit these overlaps, recognizing and exploring new directions along the way.","Widdows, Dominic and Kitto, Kirsty and Cohen, Trevor","information retrieval, natural language, mathematical foundations",10.1613/jair.1.12702,2022,35
inproceedings,MathE - Improve Mathematical Skills in Higher Education,Higher education students of scientific subjects often lack the basic mathematical skills to follow lectures and make the most of the lecturer's teachings. It is necessary to identify the gaps in each students' understanding of the concepts and offer teachers adequate resources to motivate and provide their students the skills and competences they miss. The main goal of MathE - Improve Maths Skills in Higher Education is to encourage training and exchange in order to enhance and strengthen the quality of teaching and to support the use of digital and online technologies to improve pedagogies and assessment methods. MathE also aims to set up transnational teacher training courses and strengthen cooperation between universities that already offer such courses.,"Pacheco, Maria F. and Pereira, Ana I. and Fernandes, Florbela","pedagogical innovation, higher education, open learning, distance learning, digital resources, school development",10.1145/3318396.3320116,2019,4
article,"Artificial Intelligence, Artists, and Art: Attitudes Toward Artwork Produced by Humans vs. Artificial Intelligence","This study examines how people perceive artwork created by artificial intelligence (AI) and how presumed knowledge of an artist's identity (Human vs. AI) affects individuals’ evaluation of art. Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.","Hong, Joo-Wha and Curran, Nathaniel Ming","human-machine communication, human-computer interaction, schema theory, CASA, creativity, Artificial intelligence, art",10.1145/3326337,2019,16

inproceedings,Facilitating Computing Students' Transition to Higher Education,"Students who progress to higher education from further education colleges are faced with academic, social, and logistical challenges during their transition. In general, they find university life more challenging compared to students who have been at university for two years already. The Associate Student Project (ASP) is an intervention programme within the School of Computing that provides support to students who make this transition. This support includes access to online resources, orientation events, university lectures and workshops, throughout their two years at further education college. This study aims to measure the impact of the ASP through a survey on academic behavioural confidence and a comparison of the grade point average of three student groups: independent direct entrants (n=53), associate students (n=27), and native students (students who entered university at first year, n=75). Analysis revealed that, while independent direct entrants (IDE) were less confident about their studies than native students (NS), there was a closer parity of confidence between native and associate students (AS). In addition, AS' confidence on tasks that relate to requesting information is higher than the other groups, perhaps due to the ASP's emphasis on providing good information to AS and encouraging dialogue. Associate students found interventions that provide insight into university life prior to their transfer useful. Additionally, the grade point average of AS was not found to be significantly different in comparison to native students. This paper reports on the success of these interventions in building student confidence and explores the impact for transitional students.","Fabian, Khristin and Taylor-Smith, Ella and Meharg, Debbie and Varey, Alison","widening participation, student transitions, higher education, further education, direct entrants",10.1145/3351287.3351298,2019,7
inproceedings,Foundations for Esports Curricula in Higher Education,"Esports has generated an industry of increasing economic and cultural importance. In recent years, universities and other higher education institutions have responded to its growth by establishing programmes of study which aim to satisfy the needs of innovators operating in the area. However, there is not yet consensus on what an esports curriculum should include. Despite being a technology-driven sector with ethical and professional dimensions that intersect computing, current ACM and IEEE curricula do not mention esports. Furthermore, existing courses tend to provide teaching and training on a wide variety of topics aside from those traditionally in computer science. These include: live events management; psychological research; sports science; marketing; public relations; video (livestream) production; and community management; in addition to coaching and communication. This working group examined the requirements for developing esports studies at universities with a focus on understanding career prospects in esports and on the challenges presented by its interdisciplinary complexity.

article,Higher Education Check-Ins: Exploring the User Experience of Hybrid Location Sensing,"A large body of literature is dedicated to understanding people's check-in behavior when they use location sharing services to pair their location with a venue, e.g., a restaurant, a park, etc. Check-in behavior in higher education settings, e.g., where students and instructors have academic purposes for check-ins, is under-studied. In this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes.","Huang, Yun and Sang, Yisi and Wu, Qunfang and Yao, Yaxing","hybrid sensing, check-ins, location sharing, bluetooth low energy beacon, automatic location sensing",10.1145/3359168,2019,26

This paper illustrates findings from an empirical study with the purpose of familiarizing two classes of 11-12-year-old children (N=37) with central concepts related to AI, using existing material with modifications. During the sessions, children experimented with creative and hands-on Machine Learning activities, encouraging reflection around AI and the role of technology in everyday life. Children were asked about their views of AI first, and after that the concept was explained to them. Findings of the study suggest that some children's opinion about AI was changed after they were engaged in the learning activities. Observations also suggest that children seemed to learn more easily through hands-on activities and by listening to stories.","Khalid, Kashifa and Iivari, Netta and Kinnula, Marianne and Sharma, Sumita",No data,10.1145/3569219.3569390,2022,5
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Auction Design,"Motivated by online advertising auctions, we study auction design in repeated auctions played by simple Artificial Intelligence algorithms (Q-learning). We find that first-price auctions with no additional feedback lead to tacit-collusive outcomes (bids lower than values), while second-price auctions do not. We show that the difference is driven by the incentive in first-price auctions to outbid opponents by just one bid increment. This facilitates re-coordination on low bids after a phase of experimentation. We also show that providing information about the lowest bid to win, as introduced by Google at the time of the switch to first-price auctions, increases competitiveness of auctions.","Banchio, Martino and Skrzypacz, Andrzej","auction design, algorithmic bidding, Q-learning",10.1145/3490486.3538244,2022,2
inproceedings,A is for Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Activities on Young Children's Perceptions of Robots,"We developed a novel early childhood artificial intelligence (AI) platform, PopBots, where preschool children train and interact with social robots to learn three AI concepts: knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative AI. We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children's perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives.","Williams, Randi and Park, Hae Won and Breazeal, Cynthia","child-robot interaction, ai education, social robots, early childhood education",10.1145/3290605.3300677,2019,11

article,Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: A Review,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision making are having a profound impact on our daily lives. These systems are vastly used in different high-stakes applications like healthcare, business, government, education, and justice, moving us toward a more algorithmic society. However, despite so many advantages of these systems, they sometimes directly or indirectly cause harm to the users and society. Therefore, it has become essential to make these systems safe, reliable, and trustworthy. Several requirements, such as fairness, explainability, accountability, reliability, and acceptance, have been proposed in this direction to make these systems trustworthy. This survey analyzes all of these different requirements through the lens of the literature. It provides an overview of different approaches that can help mitigate AI risks and increase trust and acceptance of the systems by utilizing the users and society. It also discusses existing strategies for validating and verifying these systems and the current standardization efforts for trustworthy AI.

inproceedings,How Do Elementary Students Conceptualize Artificial Intelligence?,"Countries around the globe have acknowledged the pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in our lives and the importance of educating our students on how AI technologies work. For example, the Chinese education ministry has integrated AI into the mandatory high school curriculum, including a pilot textbook to teach students about the fundamental AI technologies like deep learning and recognition. However, there are fewer examples of AI education at the primary level, and these are typically focused on decision-making, machine learning, and programming. We have recently started to develop our own elementary AI curriculum. To develop the curriculum, we first needed to explore what students already knew about AI. Although there are a few small studies on how primary students conceptualize AI, we conducted a study to examine how 10 nine- and ten-year-old students conceptualized artificial intelligence by focusing on two main questions: (1) How do elementary students conceptualize artificial intelligence? (2) What are elementary students' experiences with artificial intelligence? Students? definitions of AI tended to focus on programming and robotics. Students described examples of AI that included robotic vacuums, Siri/Alexa, YouTube, and search engines. They also showcased some misconceptions around AI designs and implementations.","Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Anne and Glazewski, Krista and Jeon, Minji and Hmelo-Silver, Cindy and Mott, Bradford and Lee, Seung and Lester, James","artificial intelligence, elementary education, perceptions",10.1145/3408877.3439642,2021,1

inproceedings,Ontology-Based Recommender System in Higher Education,"Academic advising is limited in its ability to assist students in identifying academic pathways. Selecting a major and a university is a challenging process rife with anxiety. Students at high school are not sure how to match their interests with their working future or major. Therefore, high school students need guidance and support. Moreover, students need to filter, prioritize and efficiently get appropriate information from the web in order to solve the problem of information overload. This paper represents an approach for developing ontology-based recommender system improved with machine learning techniques to orient students in higher education. The proposed recommender system is an assessment tool for students' vocational strengths and weaknesses, interests and capabilities. The main objective of our ontology-based recommender system is to identify the student requirements, interests, preferences and capabilities to recommend the appropriate major and university for each one.","Obeid, Charbel and Lahoud, Inaya and El Khoury, Hicham and Champin, Pierre-Antoine","education, recommender system, ontology-based",10.1145/3184558.3191533,2018,4
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence for Conversational Robo-Advisor,"With the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era, the combination of AI with financial technology (FinTech) has become a development trend in the financial industry. However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor.","Day, Min-Yuh and Lin, Jian-Ting and Chen, Yuan-Chih","deep learning, financial technology (FinTech), artificial intelligence (AI), robo-advisor, conversational commerce",No data,2020,8
inproceedings,Gender Perspective in Artificial Intelligence (AI),"In Spain, the majority of university students are women, but the gender distribution in different fields of study is uneven and there are certain disciplines, as engineering and some experimental sciences where less than 30% are women. This reduced participation of women, very low in disciplines related with technology motivates the hegemonic presence of androcentric and sexist values both in knowledge and in the products and information technologies that we can find in the market.In highly masculinized disciplines the inclusion of the gender perspective is important whenever the content, the results or the applications of a subject may affect human beings directly or indirectly. Specially, in disciplines related with technology where it is very common for men and women to be affected differently by technological developments. This paper focus in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, where the majority of professionals are men and their experiences shape and dominate algorithm creation. To recognize the existence of gender discriminatory biases in the algorithms and limit their consequences in the offline world, we need to introduce the gender perspective in these studies.

The job market for artificial intelligence has been promising as many practical applications have become viable nowadays. Over the years, many universities and colleges offers an introductory artificial intelligence course to undergraduate students. With the progress in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning, one introductory AI course is insufficient and an approach to integrating artificial intelligence across undergraduate curriculum is essential and appealing. In this poster, we present our project based approach to integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts to a variety of undergraduate courses.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Risk in Design,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are more and more integrated into everyday lives, both scholarly and popular discourses on AI's often revolve around charting the various risks that may be associated with them. The manner and magnitude of risk that various researchers identify and foresee varies; however, what is common between them is, undoubtedly, the concept of risk itself. This concept, we argue, has been largely taken for granted by the fields involved in the research on AI's; in other words, ""risk"" has been employed with an everyday sensibility without due critical examination. In this paper, we address risk as a concept directly, by examining interdisciplinary theories and literatures on risk to discuss examples of AI technologies. Through this work, we aim to begin a critical discussion of the importance of theorising risk within design research and practice, and within the development of emerging technologies.","Luusua, Aale and Ylipulli, Johanna","urban ai, general ai, objective risk, artificial intelligence, risk, theory, experience, subjective risk, narrow ai",10.1145/3357236.3395491,2020,10

inproceedings,Spatial-Data-Driven Student Characterization in Higher Education,"Higher Education is facing disruptive innovation that requires, among other things, provision of a more effective and customized education service to individual students. In the field of Learning Analytics (LA), there has been much effort, in the form of the collection and thorough analysis of a variety of student-related datasets, to optimize learning performance and environments by means of personalization. The datasets include traditional questionnaire surveys, learning management system (LMS) log data of learner activities, and, more recently in the wake of the big-data-analytics trend, unstructured datasets such as SNS activities, text data, and other transactional data. Spatial data, however, is rarely considered as a key dataset, despite its high potential for characterization of students and prediction of their performances and conditions. In this context, the authors propose a new, spatial-data-driven student-characterization research framework. This vision paper describes spatial computing in its three, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive modeling stages as well as its three challenges: (1) technical spatial data acquisition issues; (2) legal and administrative issues; (3) expansion of the application domains in which spatial data can contribute to improved modeling quality. With respect to each challenge, the on-going efforts are briefly introduced in order to substantiate the feasibility of the proposed research framework.","Heo, Joon and Chung, Kyong-Mee and Yoon, Sanghyun and Yun, Sung Bum and Ma, Jong Won and Ju, Sungha","Spatial data, Student Characterization, Higher Education, Learning Analytics",10.1145/3152341.3152343,2017,4

My work advocates for a new approach toward the interaction between AI methods and the social that centers principles of distributive justice. As AI increasingly drives consequential social decision-making, we must consider not only what can be done but what ought to be done.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Empowered Domain Modelling Bot,"With the increasing adoption of Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) to handle the complexity of modern software systems in industry and inclusion of modelling topics in academic curricula, it is no longer a question of whether to use MBSE but how to use it. Acquiring modelling skills to properly build and use models with the help of modelling formalisms are non-trivial learning objectives, which novice modellers struggle to achieve for several reasons. For example, it is difficult for novice modellers to learn to use their abstraction abilities. Also, due to high student-teacher ratios in a typical classroom setting, novice modellers may not receive personalized and timely feedback on their modelling decisions. These issues hinder the novice modellers in improving their modelling skills. Furthermore, a lack of modelling skills among modellers inhibits the adoption and practice of modelling in industry. Therefore, an automated and intelligent solution is required to help modellers and other practitioners in improving their modelling skills. This doctoral research builds an automated and intelligent solution for one modelling formalism - domain models, in an avatar of a domain modelling bot. The bot automatically extracts domain models from problem descriptions written in natural language and generates intelligent recommendations, particularly for teaching modelling literacy to novice modellers. For this domain modelling bot, we leverage the capabilities of various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.","Saini, Rijul","natural language processing (NLP), bot, machine learning (ML), natural language (NL), domain model, artificial intelligence (AI)",10.1145/3417990.3419486,2020,6

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in the Government: Responses to Failures and Social Impact,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pervading the government and transforming how public services are provided to consumers---from allocation of benefits to law enforcement, risk monitoring and the provision of services. Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI's failures? In thirteen preregistered studies (N = 3,724), we document a robust effect of algorithmic transference: algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans---as outgroups characterized by greater homogeneity than ingroups of comparable humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm at a higher rate than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Assessing AI's impact on consumers and societies, we show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may engender algorithmic transference and undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize.","Longoni, Chiara and Cian, Luca and Kyung, Ellie","social impact, artificial intelligence, public policy, government, algorithm",10.1145/3514094.3534125,2022,1

inproceedings,Do People Believe in Artificial Intelligence? A Cross-Topic Multicultural Study,"In the era of 4.0 industry, artificial intelligence and machine learning are the undisputed protagonists on a world-wide stage. In the last decade, expert and learning systems have been widely applied to a plethora of tasks that were considered, in the past, as solvable only by a human. And on top of that, machines are becoming more reliable and accurate than human experts.However, despite the artificial intelligence being drenched in our everyday life, people do not completely realize this radical change, and they have a warped perception of it. In this work, we aim at exploring and analyzing the human perception and trust in artificial intelligence. To this end, we collected personal opinions concerning juicy topics in artificial intelligence literature, meaning the interpretability of black-box models, and the reliability of autonomous systems. The analysis has been conducted on different applications, including medical and cybersecurity domains.","Kolasinska, Agnieszka and Lauriola, Ivano and Quadrio, Giacomo","human perception, machine learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3342428.3342667,2019,6

More and more users like to take photos or screenshots through smart phones to save and share their life information. Subsequently, using computer to recognize and process image information becomes more and more important. Image recognition technology is an important research field of artificial intelligence. This technology can enable computers to process a large amount of information instead of human beings, so as to free human beings from cumbersome workload. Image recognition technology [3-5] meets the relevant needs of actual users through the steps of relevant information acquisition, preprocessing and model training. Image recognition technology first defines the characteristics of related objects, then memory image matching, and finally image recognition.

Although the domain of AI has seen substantial improvements over recent years, its effectiveness is limited by the capabilities of current computing technology. Recently, there have been several architectural innovations for AI using emerging nanotechnology. These architectures implement mathematical computations of AI with circuits that utilize physical behavior of nanodevices purpose-built for such computations. This approach leads to a much greater efficiency vs. software algorithms running on von Neumann processors or CMOS architectures, which emulate the operations with transistor circuits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of these architectural directions and categorize them based on their contributions.

inproceedings,Better Metrics for Evaluating Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"This paper presents objective metrics for how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be quantified. Through an overview of current trends, we show that many explanations are generated post-hoc and independent of the agent's logical process, which in turn creates explanations with limited meaning as they lack transparency and fidelity. While user studies are a known basis for evaluating XAI, studies that do not consider objective metrics for evaluating XAI may have limited meaning and may suffer from confirmation bias, particularly if they use low fidelity explanations unnecessarily. To avoid this issue, this paper suggests a paradigm shift in evaluating XAI that focuses on metrics that quantify the explanation itself and its appropriateness given the XAI goal. We suggest four such metrics based on performance differences, D, between the explanation's logic and the agent's actual performance, the number of rules, R, outputted by the explanation, the number of features, F, used to generate that explanation, and the stability, S, of the explanation. We believe that user studies that focus on these metrics in their evaluations are inherently more valid and should be integrated in future XAI research.","Rosenfeld, Avi","system evaluation, explainable artificial intelligence, interpretable machine learning, human-agent systems",No data,2021,6

Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student.

inproceedings,Artificial Concepts of Artificial Intelligence: Institutional Compliance and Resistance in AI Startups,"Scholars and industry practitioners have debated how to best develop interventions for ethical artificial intelligence (AI). Such interventions recommend that companies building and using AI tools change their technical practices, but fail to wrangle with critical questions about the organizational and institutional context in which AI is developed. In this paper, we contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI"" as a discursive concept and organizational practice in an understudied sphere--emerging AI startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by entrepreneurs. Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective interventions towards building ethical AI.","Winecoff, Amy A. and Watkins, Elizabeth Anne","organizational theory, artificial intelligence, ethical systems, industry practice, qualitative methods",10.1145/3514094.3534138,2022,12

inproceedings,Graduates' Prediction System Using Artificial Intelligence,"Graduation rates are an essential metric for universities to gauge the effectiveness of their programmes. Prediction models can be used to assess students' likelihood of completing their degrees, as well as to analyse the rate of completion of programmes that they offer.Several studies have been done previously using predictive models in various universities around the world. At King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok (KMUTNB), Prachuabsupakij and Wuttikamolchai developed a web application that used the Decision Tree Algorithm to predict student's graduation. Other studies made use of other machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, neural network and classification and regression tree algorithms. These studies achieved a successful prediction rate of an average of above 70% accuracy.The University of Namibia does not have any predictive models of any kind and neither has any study of this nature ever been done. It was for this reason that this study was conducted using the School of Computing as the case study. The study would then develop a graduates' prediction system for the school of computing.The system is a web-based application that requires a user to log in before accessing its features, such as displaying the predicted outcomes. A sample of 500 student data was used to create the student dataset. The prediction was done using four different prediction models which were then comparatively analysed. Those prediction models are Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random forest.The web-based application consists of an interactive dashboard to allow the user to visualize the prediction results which can be view using different types of charts all to the user's convenience.This study managed to attain its main object of creating a student graduation prediction system for the school of computing and the sub-objective were also met. The predictions of this study were purely based on the students' academic results in the form of credit scores and other factors were not considered.

The research shows that the coupling and coordination degree of artificial intelligence to the commercial sports industry is mainly divided into three levels: the type of imbalance in the recession, the type of sub state coordination and the type of coordination in the rising period. The coupling between artificial intelligence system and the commercial sports industry is not a simple process. It needs to completely deduce all links, such as the coupling of intelligent technology innovation, the coupling of intelligent new products in the industrial chain, the coupling of intelligent policy network collaborative subjects, and the coupling of the market, The ultimate goal is to realize the coupling route of artificial intelligence system + large-scale operational sports industry.","Yang, Bo","Artificial intelligence, Commercial sports industry, Coupling model, Influence application",10.1145/3545822.3545833,2022,6

inproceedings,Gender Bias in Artificial Intelligence: The Need for Diversity and Gender Theory in Machine Learning,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly influencing the opinions and behavior of people in everyday life. However, the over-representation of men in the design of these technologies could quietly undo decades of advances in gender equality. Over centuries, humans developed critical theory to inform decisions and avoid basing them solely on personal experience. However, machine intelligence learns primarily from observing data that it is presented with. While a machine's ability to process large volumes of data may address this in part, if that data is laden with stereotypical concepts of gender, the resulting application of the technology will perpetuate this bias. While some recent studies sought to remove bias from learned algorithms they largely ignore decades of research on how gender ideology is embedded in language. Awareness of this research and incorporating it into approaches to machine learning from text would help prevent the generation of biased algorithms. Leading thinkers in the emerging field addressing bias in artificial intelligence are also primarily female, suggesting that those who are potentially affected by bias are more likely to see, understand and attempt to resolve it. Gender balance in machine learning is therefore crucial to prevent algorithms from perpetuating gender ideologies that disadvantage women.","Leavy, Susan","text analytics, machine learning, gender bias",10.1145/3195570.3195580,2018,3

inproceedings,Should Artificial Intelligence Governance Be Centralised? Design Lessons from History,"Can effective international governance for artificial intelligence remain fragmented, or is there a need for a centralised international organisation for AI? We draw on the history of other international regimes to identify advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising. Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or simply inadequate.","Cihon, Peter and Maas, Matthijs M. and Kemp, Luke","centralization, institutional design, governance fragmentation, global governance, artificial intelligence policy, regime complex",10.1145/3375627.3375857,2020,7
inproceedings,Automated Condition Monitoring Using Artificial Intelligence,"Machine maintenance is a major part of total operating costs for manufacturing and production plants, hence, having a cost-effective maintenance strategy is key to success. Most standard solutions operate on a time-driven approach where repairs or replacements are carried out after a given amount of time. This results in healthy machines being replaced unnecessarily incurring losses in both time, resource, and parts. Predictive maintenance utilises sensors capable of collecting real-time operating data and analytical techniques to predict when a machine will require maintenance. This research develops a vibration analysis tool that can detect and differentiate a machines operating conditions without any human analysis or intervention demonstrated via a case study. By using spectrograms in conjunction with image recognition and unsupervised learning, the tool is capable of being applied to many different machines without modification. Results show that features extracted using convolutional auto-encoding and t-SNE, are capable of being clustered in an unsupervised manner accurately based on case study test conditions. Future work looks at the application of this tool into a real-time data stream that can determine operating conditions in real-time.","Griffiths, Ieuan","Predictive maintenance, Unsupervised learning, Fault detection, Machine maintenance, Signal processing, Neural networks, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Condition monitoring",10.1145/3448823.3448863,2021,7

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Education: Ethical Issues and Its Regulations,"After the birth of human beings, biological evolution essentially ceased. Since then, the evolution of human civilization has been initiated, with curiosity driving science and the desire for control driving technology. The development of science and technology has unfolded in two dimensions of outward and inward, the outward from the solar system, the galaxy to the universe; the inward pointing to human itself, from the movement of life to the movement of consciousness, giving rise to artificial intelligence (AI). For the first time, the ""human-like"" nature of AI has shaken the social activity in which the world is the stage and humans are the main actors, leading to the ethical issues of AI, of course, including the ethical issues of AI in education(AIEd). The ethical issue of AIEd is the problem caused by the transformation of the actors by implanting humanoids into the human educational community. The main issues include the ethical problem of AI, the adaption of new human and new norms of human behaviors, and the stage for the activities of the actors—the field of AIEd. The regulations of ethical issues of AIEd should aim at the pursuit of human well-being and focus on practice, mainly from the aspects of customs transfer, norms construction and legislation constraints.","Zhang, Liguo and Fu, Kefeng and Liu, Xiaolin","Regulations, Artificial Intelligence, AI in Education, Ethical Issues, Educational Ethics",10.1145/3524383.3524406,2022,6

As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution sweeps through societies and enters daily life, its role in shaping India's development and growth is bound to be substantial. For India, AI holds promise as a catalyst to accelerate progress, while providing mechanisms to leapfrog traditional hurdles such as poor infrastructure and bureaucracy. At the same time, an investment in AI is accompanied by risk factors with long-term implications on society: it is imperative that risks be vetted at this early stage. In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for AI in India. We detail opportunities that are cross-cutting (bridging India's linguistic divisions, mining public data), and also specific to one particular sector (healthcare). We list challenges that originate from existing social conditions (such as equations of caste and gender). Thereafter we distill out concrete steps and safeguards, which we believe are necessary for robust and inclusive development as India enters the AI era.","Kalyanakrishnan, Shivaram and Panicker, Rahul Alex and Natarajan, Sarayu and Rao, Shreya","artificial intelligence, india",10.1145/3278721.3278738,2018,7
inproceedings,Estimating Student Dropout in Distance Higher Education Using Semi-Supervised Techniques,"Nowadays, distance higher education has rapidly increased due to advance and integration of information and communications' technology. Students who attend online distance courses have often family obligations and job commitments and are usually in 'high risk' of dropout during their attendance. It is of a highly importance to identify such students, through paying extra attention and support to them could possibly minimize the possibility of student failure or even dropout. The present research intends to study whether semi-supervised techniques could be useful in student dropout prediction in distance higher education. Semi-supervised learning aims to generate reliable predictions using few labeled and many unlabeled data. Labeled data are difficult obtainable quite often, as they require many experts, a lot of human effort and time in experiments. As far as, we are aware in several studies propose and compare supervised methods for students' dropout prediction rates in higher education, but none of them investigates the effectiveness of semi-supervised methods. The results of our experiments reveal that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved using few labeled data in comparison to well known supervised learning algorithms. For that purpose we have developed a web-based tool to estimate if an individual student is going to dropout.","Kostopoulos, Georgios and Kotsiantis, Sotiris and Pintelas, Panagiotis","distance higher education, tri-training algorithm, semi-supervised learning, C4.5 decision tree, dropout",10.1145/2801948.2802013,2015,6

These challenges are increasingly complex because of the global competition for resources, students and teachers. In addition, the amount of data produced inside and outside higher education institutions has grown exponentially, so more and more institutions are exploring the potential of Big Data to meet these challenges. In this context, higher education institutions and key stakeholders (students, teachers, and governance) can derive multiple benefits from learning analytics using different data analysis strategies to produce summative, real-time and predictive information and recommendations. However, it may be questioned whether institutions, academic administrative staff as well as including those with responsibility for governance, are prepared for learning analytics?

We suggest the use of artificial intelligence to pre-classify and organize historic photographs in collections and archives. With regard to uncertainty the concept of artificial intelligence based classification is discussed based on two questions: (1) What is the uncertainty in current archival documentation, assuming that the quality and completeness of a current classification depends on the partial and restricted knowledge of a person? (2) Can algorithmic concepts help to quantify the level of uncertainty? The aspect of documentation is discussed based on a comparison of algorithms and classical processes. The contribution of artificial intelligence to quantify the uncertainty is tested in a case study.

inproceedings,Conceptual Challenges of Researching Artificial Intelligence in Public Administrations,"Research has been advancing on the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public administrations. However, there is limited consensus and agreement on what is considered Artificial Intelligence, as different understandings and approaches in research and practice exist. This paper explores and compares the varying ways AI has been described and understood in previous Information Systems and eGovernment research. Following, a survey amongst Belgium civil servants is analysed to assess what they associate with the term Artificial Intelligence. The findings show that many civil servants tend to associate AI with being able to conduct intelligent tasks, have certain capabilities or are specific applications they are familiar with. Specific algorithms or learning methods, often included in research papers, are not associated with the term AI. These results show that researchers and policymakers may have opposite or even paradoxical views on what is or is not AI, which could have significant consequences for researching the adoption of AI in government, as well as comparing different research findings. In this respect, the paper proposes to use an integrative lens to study AI in government, by including different dimensions and understandings.","van Noordt, Colin","Public administration, Perceptions, Civil Servants, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3543434.3543441,2022,8

A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.","Longoni, Chiara and Fradkin, Andrey and Cian, Luca and Pennycook, Gordon","generative artificial intelligence, news, algorithmic transparency, fairness, news generation",10.1145/3531146.3533077,2022,10
inproceedings,Hard Choices and Hard Limits in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is supposed to help us make better choices. Some of these choices are small, like what route to take to work, or what music to listen to. Others are big, like what treatment to administer for a disease or how long to sentence someone for a crime. If AI can assist with these big decisions, we might think it can also help with hard choices, cases where alternatives are neither better, worse nor equal but on a par. The aim of this paper, however, is to show that this view is mistaken: the fact of parity shows that there are hard limits on AI in decision making and choices that AI cannot, and should not, resolve.","Goodman, Bryce","hard choices, fairness, AI ethics, value alignment",10.1145/3461702.3462539,2021,10

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in Conversational Agents: A Study of Factors Related to Perceived Humanness in Chatbots,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in service-oriented businesses in the form of chatbots. A chatbot is a popular type of social AI that uses natural language processing to communicate with users. Past studies have shown discrepancies in terms of whether or not a chatbot should communicate and behave like a human. This article aims to explore these discrepancies in order to provide a theoretical contribution of a list of factors related to perceived humanness in chatbots and how these may consequently lead to a positive user experience. The results suggest that a chatbot should have the following characteristics: avoiding small talk and maintaining a formal tone; identifying itself as a bot and asking how it can help; providing specific information and articulating itself with sophisticated choices of words and well-constructed sentences; asking follow-up questions during decision-making processes and; providing an apology when the context is not comprehensible, followed by a question or a statement to dynamically move a conversation forward. These results may have implications for designers working in the field of AI as well as for the wider debates and the broader discourse around the adoption of AI in society.","Svenningsson, Nina and Faraon, Montathar","chatbot, AI, humanness, user experience, design guideline, conversation, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3375959.3375973,2020,11
inproceedings,The Seductive Allure of Artificial Intelligence-Powered Neurotechnology,"Neuroscience explanations-even when completely irrelevant-have been shown to exert a ""seductive allure"" on individuals, leading them to judge bad explanations or arguments more favorably. There seems to be a similarly seductive allure for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, leading people to ""overtrust"" these systems, even when they have just witnessed the system perform poorly. The AI-powered neurotechnologies that have begun to proliferate in recent years, particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), represent a potentially doubly-alluring combination. While there is enormous potential benefit in applying AI techniques in neuroscience to ""decode"" brain activity and associated mental states, these efforts are still in the early stages, and there is a danger in using these unproven technologies prematurely, especially in important, real-world contexts. Yet, such premature use has begun to emerge in several high-stakes set-tings, including the law, health &amp; wellness, employment, and transportation. In light of the potential seductive allure of these technologies, we need to be vigilant in monitoring their scientific validity and challenging both unsubstantiated claims and misuse, while still actively supporting their continued development and proper use.","Giattino, Charles M. and Kwong, Lydia and Rafetto, Chad and Farahany, Nita A.","decoding, overtrust, EEG, neurotechnology",10.1145/3306618.3314269,2019,6
inproceedings,"Robot-Robot Interaction, Toward New Conversational Artificial Intelligence Aesthetic","Artificial Intelligence nowadays is an intriguing medium for the new generation of contemporary artists. They are many approaches to the utilization of AI as creative media. Our creative practice and art-based research approach challenge artificial intelligence abstraction and automated content creation with notable philosophical publications. We move the medium beyond traditional usage and interpretations by designing AI agents more independent and engaged in creation through new types of robot-robot interactions. The medium as such is not any more in complete control of an artist and known artistic practices. Hence, we need to extend our aesthetical and conceptual judgments from solely human to human and robot creativity analysis. Consequently, we aim to raise some of the fundamental questions about artificial intelligence's impact on future human-AI society.

Experts have gone so far as to chart the future development of AI systems that surpass human intelligence as a single civilization-shifting event, known as the ""technological singularity"" or ""the Singularity."" But in the more near future, AI promises to have more concrete applications throughout our everyday lives, including in education, a challenge that China has already taken up. At present, the main applications of this so-called ""weak"" artificial intelligence in Chinese education are MOOC, web classes, and the flipped class model, with the results already proving outstanding. With the deeper combination of AI and education, we can look forward to benefits like the increasing usefulness of after-school tutoring robots, reliving teachers of burdensome responsibilities, and balancing global education resources. We should, however, also use AI in education reasonably by contextualizing gathered data, strengthening legal protections, and developing moral guidelines in machine programming. Addressing these three points will address the concerns of many laypeople as AI systems are implemented, offering protection for their fragile beginnings in education and encouraging the development of better ones in the future.","Peng, Liu and Xiaohong, Si","Education and teaching in China, Development prediction, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3234825.3234839,2018,4

inproceedings,Teachers’ Perspective on Artificial Intelligence Education: An Initial Investigation,"Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.","Polak, Sara and Schiavo, Gianluca and Zancanaro, Massimo","AI Education, Digital Competencies, Computing education",10.1145/3491101.3519866,2022,7

inproceedings,Training Path of College Tennis Talents Based on Artificial Intelligence,"Tennis is a unique and beautiful sport. In recent years, tennis has become more and more enthusiastic around the world, and some tennis academies have sprung up like bamboo shoots. With the gradual improvement of the tennis atmosphere, the tennis crowd has gradually increased, but at this time there is a lack of a comprehensive tennis training base and a scientific and systematic talent training model to promote the development of Chinese tennis in the future. And it happens to be a period of rapid development of artificial intelligence. Therefore, this article studies and discusses the training path of tennis talents in colleges and universities based on artificial intelligence. Through an in-depth analysis of the training path of our country's tennis competitive talents, the current stage of our country's tennis talent training mainly relies on the following three methods: sports team training model; club training model; government, enterprise, and family joint training model. Through the introduction of artificial intelligence-related technologies, experiments on these three methods are conducted in the artificial intelligence environment. The results show that, compared with ordinary tennis talent training models, the physical and humanistic qualities of college tennis talents get 30%. The improvement of the service period and technical level of college tennis competitive talents has also reached 10% compared with the traditional training path. This shows that in the current global environment, combining the training path of tennis competitive talents in colleges and universities with the emerging artificial intelligence technology, the effect is very significant, and it is the development trend of future tennis competitive talent training.","Lv, Lili and Xu, Yijun",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495290,2022,5

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Indigenous Perspectives: Protecting and Empowering Intelligent Human Beings,"As 'control' is increasingly ceded to AI systems, potentially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) humanity may be facing an identity crisis sooner rather than later, whereby the notion of 'intelligence' no longer remains solely our own. This paper characterizes the problem in terms of an impending loss of control and proposes a relational shift in our attitude towards AI. The shortcomings of value alignment as a solution to the problem are outlined which necessitate an extension of these principles. One such approach is considering strongly relational Indigenous epistemologies. The value of Indigenous perspectives has not been canvassed widely in the literature. Their utility becomes clear when considering the existence of well-developed epistemologies adept at accounting for the non-human, a task that defies Western anthropocentrism. Accommodating AI by considering it as part of our network is a step towards building a symbiotic relationship. Given that AGI questions our fundamental notions of what it means to have human rights, it is argued that in order to co-exist, we find assistance in Indigenous traditions such as the Hawaiian and Lakota ontologies. Lakota rituals provide comfort with the conception of non-human soul-bearer while Hawaiian stories provide possible relational schema to frame our relationship with AI.","Maitra, Suvradip","indigenous perspectives, value alignment, human rights, ethics, relational shift",10.1145/3375627.3375845,2020,7

article,Trailblazing the Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity Discipline: A Multi-Disciplinary Research Roadmap,"Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, AI and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the AI for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the AI for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant AI for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary AI for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced AI methodologies for cybersecurity, and AI-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand AI for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

inproceedings,Learning Analytics in Higher Education: The Student Expectations of Learning Analytics,"The report's purpose is to discover whether individual differences are connected with student expectations for learning analytics. The aim was to evaluate if the Big Five personality traits are connected to student predictions about learning analytics. Learning analytics is well-positioned to greatly improve student learning. There are many unanswered questions that are intertwined in that belief, which deals with learning analytics as a whole. Students' learning processes can be better supported and understood by using learning analytics. The goal of this investigation is to examine students' ideas about learning analytics tools' attributes and their interest in applying these features for education. In a first-stage investigation, researchers interviewed 364 university students. Smart PLS was used to carry out data analysis. Research that involves exploratory research will benefit from using partial least squares (PLS). The equal engagement of all stakeholders, from external organisations to individual students, is a challenge faced by each university given the global interest in learning analytics. Student expectations of learning analytics elements were discovered, and students are looking for support with planning and organising their learning processes, tools for self-assessment, delivery of adaptive recommendations, and personal evaluations of their learning.","Abdul Jalil, Nasir and Wong Ei Leen, Mikkay","Learning analytics, Higher Education, Educational Technology",10.1145/3502434.3502463,2022,6
inproceedings,"Formalizing Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Prerequisites, Causes and Goals of Human Trust in AI","Trust is a central component of the interaction between people and AI, in that 'incorrect' levels of trust may cause misuse, abuse or disuse of the technology. But what, precisely, is the nature of trust in AI? What are the prerequisites and goals of the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction? This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user; and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust', such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of 'trustworthiness' (that detaches from the notion of trustworthiness in sociology), and with it concepts of 'warranted' and 'unwarranted' trust. We present the possible causes of warranted trust as intrinsic reasoning and extrinsic behavior, and discuss how to design trustworthy AI, how to evaluate whether trust has manifested, and whether it is warranted. Finally, we elucidate the connection between trust and XAI using our formalization.","Jacovi, Alon and Marasovi\'{c}, Ana and Miller, Tim and Goldberg, Yoav","distrust, contractual trust, trustworthy, artificial intelligence, sociology, warranted trust, trust, formalization",10.1145/3442188.3445923,2021,12

article,Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence: Evidence from a Survey of Machine Learning Researchers,"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang &amp; Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

article,In the Black Mirror: Youth Investigations into Artificial Intelligence,"Over the past two decades, innovations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have extended into nearly all facets of human experience. Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.","Lee, Clifford H. and Gobir, Nimah and Gurn, Alex and Soep, Elisabeth","ethics-centered, computational thinking, engagement, machine learning, media, agency, Critical pedagogy, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3484495,2022,25

inproceedings,A Comparative Study of Programming Competencies in Vocational Training and Higher Education,"Technical progress and social transformation processes require lifelong learning in different spaces and formats. This leads to new developments and challenges in education with regard to competency-based learning and recognition practices, especially as educational biographies become increasingly diverse and extensive repetitions of qualifications should be avoided. Until recently, a common assessment strategy for previously developed competencies has not been established in higher education. In this study, competencies expected in German vocational and higher educational programming training were identified, compared and evaluated with regard to equivalence. The methodological approach started with an extensive review of general frameworks and curricula, before competency descriptions and analyses of reference documents of German vocational and university programming education were gathered and systematically compared. As part of the iterative design process, a comparison matrix was developed, and common features along with gaps and overlaps of competencies were identified. Even though both educational tracks pursue different goals, they share a great number of expected programming competencies. In the context of lifelong learning, the proposed process can be utilized for improving the permeability and recognition practises in both vocational training and higher education.","Kiesler, Natalie and Thorbr\""{u}gge, Carsten","competency, comparison, programming education, vocational training, educational system analysis, recognition, higher education",10.1145/3502718.3524818,2022,7
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Organizational Memory in Government: The Experience of Record Duplication in the Child Welfare Sector in Canada,"In recent years, the topic of artificial intelligence in government has become a major area of study. Governments have been eager to adopt artificial intelligence for a number of purposes, including for the prediction of risk in social services. Child protection services are exploring predictive analytics for the initial screening of cases. While research identifies data quality issues as a major barrier, little is known about the characteristics of these issues in child protection, their relationship to organizational memory contained in administrative data, and their impact on the ability of an organization to adopt these technologies. This study gained insight into the socio-technical limitations of duplicate records when trying to bring organizational memory to bear in predictive decision support by interviewing and observing staff use of information technology systems. The study's findings suggest that record duplication in case management systems in child protection could pose a significant challenge to the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies such as predictive analytics for decision assistance. There is a need to address foundational information management and system issues before artificial intelligence approaches such as this can be introduced in the child protection sector.","M.

article,Exploitation for Multimedia Asian Information Processing and Artificial Intelligence-Based Art Design and Teaching in Colleges,"Artificial intelligence has been widely used in art education and learning due to its quick progress. &nbsp;Any creation made with the help of artificial intelligence is referred to as art design. It covers works generated independently by AI systems and works created in collaboration with humans and AI systems. The objective of directing the invention of environmental art design thinking is to stimulate students' learning and innovation abilities and teach students how to put design ideas into effect. Despite the progress of smart technologies, there are several challenges in increasing the teaching capabilities of technical art design courses, such as the influence of different variables, the absence of quantitative research, and the imperfection in the index system. In this paper, the Artificial intelligence-based Art design and teaching (AI-ADT) method in colleges increases the capacity to adapt to AI-oriented art education, establish intelligent teaching methods, and improve AI-oriented art teaching art knowledge and environments. The widespread application of artificial intelligence in design education has become a trend in development. Self-Learning Systems are software that incorporates machine learning techniques to allow computers to learn from and make judgments based on data without the need for explicit programming instructions. The art design profession should confirm and actively adapt to this development trend. Modify the original teaching mode, invent their teaching methods, continually enrich the teaching methods, enhance the quality of teaching, and constantly foster high-quality art design talents in the new age. AI-ADT investigates the optimization of the art design curriculum system in higher education institutions in the context of artificial intelligence.

inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence Meets Kinesthetic Intelligence: Mouse-Based User Authentication Based on Hybrid Human-Machine Learning,"Current mainstream biometric user authentication approaches are based on passive measurements of the subject's characteristics, and usually come with less-than-satisfactory accuracy. This paper takes a unique approach to biometric authentication. Specifically, instead of training a machine learning algorithm to recognize a legitimate user, the paper proposes a hybrid type of training, in which the legitimate user is also trained to use a customized instance of the machine. The user thus achieves a level of artificially-induced expertise to interact with the machine, which makes the user easier to recognize. We implement this concept in a mouse-based user authentication system, in which we produce customized machine instances by introducing an angle offset to the standard mouse. Human subjects then rely on their kinesthetic intelligence to achieve motor learning and visual-motor adaptation to the modified mouse. We design a 7-week IRB-approved experiment, collect data from 18 human subjects over this period, and evaluate the proposed approach with two existing state-of-the-art mouse-based authentication schemes. We find that, in both schemes, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in which a regular unaltered mouse is used. Somewhat surprisingly, results also show that our approach improves the authentication performance even when both legitimate and non-legitimate users are trained to exactly the same instance of customized machine (i.e., the same mouse angle offset). In addition, we also observe that users can generally maintain their learned expertise even after one week of washout, which further demonstrates the practicality of the approach. Finally, we present a practical strategy to manage the enrollment of users in such a proposed system.","Fu, Shen and Qin, Dong and Amariucai, George and Qiao, Daji and Guan, Yong and Smiley, Ann","behavioral biometrics, mouse-based user authentication, kinesthetic intelligence, induced expertise",10.1145/3488932.3523257,2022,15
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on the Prediction of Economic Indicators,"Economic indicators are key statistics based on economy, some examples of economic indicators are inflation rate, gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, consumer price indices (CPI), interest rate, exports, consumption of energy, among others. Most of the published studies are focused on contextualizing and predict a particular economic indicator without considering the current general situation on how non-linear models have been used in predicting some of the economic indicators. This article, has analyzed in the scientific production the artificial intelligence methods mostly used in the development of prediction models of economic indicators. The study was carried out by means of a systematic literature review (SLR) using the Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and Google Scholar bibliographic databases (BD) as resources. The documents and general information analyzed qualitatively are filtered between the range of years 2015 to 2019 to which an adequate set of quality and selection criteria were applied. The approach of the research questions allowed to describe the outcomes in categories where the studies by predicted economic indicator and applied artificial intelligence method have been successfully included. The outcomes that have been obtained in this article represent a starting point for researchers, academics and professionals who wish to carry out studies related to the prediction of economic indicators using some artificial intelligence (AI) methods. In conclusion, some of the artificial intelligence methods used to predict economic indicators are artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive systems of diffuse neuro inference (ANFIS), genetic programming (GP), support vector regression (SVR), machines extreme learning and other machine learning (ML) techniques.","Ram\'{\i}rez, Kevin Mero and Hormaza, Jaime Meza and Soto, Sebasti\'{a}n Ventura","economic indicator prediction models, nonlinear models, Artificial intelligence models",10.1145/3410352.3410827,2020,8

inproceedings,Innovative Application of Artificial Intelligence Technology in College Physical Education,"With the gradual enrichment of people's material life, more people have a stronger desire to pursue spiritual life. As an important carrier of physical education (PD) in colleges and universities, (artificial intelligence) AI technology, its role cannot be ignored. However, at this stage, the intelligent construction of college gymnasiums in our country is still in its infancy, and there is still a lot of room for development. The purpose of this article is to study the innovative application of AI technology in college PD. Taking the gymnasium of the college of PD as the object, through the analysis of the intelligent system of the gymnasium of the sports college, the integration and linkage functions of its AI system are discussed, and related issues in the planning and design of the intelligent system of the college gymnasium are proposed, and these issues are discussed. It is proposed that relevant design factors should be fully considered when designing the intelligent system of college gymnasiums, so as to realize the goals of advanced technology, maturity, reasonable economy, practical functions, safety and reliability, and sustainable development. The college gymnasium is an important support point for the development of college sports teaching innovation. Its AI system has strong professionalism. In the early stage of its planning and design, the entire gymnasium needs to be accurately positioned in conjunction with the corresponding sports items, and the gymnasium accepts the main personnel are the starting point, and the relevant information system layout is guided by the difference of different spatial information needs, which fully reflects the ""people-oriented"" principle. The experimental results show that the scores of students in the experimental group are mostly 85 points and above, while the results of students in the control group are concentrated in the range of 65 to 85. The practical ability of PD students under the AI gymnasium has improved significantly. Students are explaining and organizing actions. There is a good learning ability in teaching activities.","Lou, Zhen",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483082,2021,5
inproceedings,Data Analytics and Visualization to Support the Adult Learner in Higher Education,"Data analytics can be used by higher education to have a deeper understanding of the learners and their learning. As the use of data analytics become more common, educators are often required not only to make sense of the analytics, but also make meaning pedagogically to better support the learner and the learning. This paper discusses the conceptualization and implementation of targeted learner support and intervention with the use of learning analytics and data visualization for the adult learner in higher education. The key objective is to leverage on learners’ metrics in a format with visual indicators that give an overview of various aspects of the learning so that higher education institutions can profile their adult learners and anticipate their needs with customized advisories and intervention approaches. The learner metrics is presented in two different dashboards, applying both descriptive and predictive analytics, to provide deeper insights.","Chong, Sylvia and Lee, Yew Haur and Tang, Yoke Wah","adult learners, data visualization, Learning analytics",10.1145/3421682.3421698,2020,6
inproceedings,Artificial Intelligence in the Construction of an Adaptive Pedagogical Model for Mathematics Leveling,"There is an enormous disadvantage for students who, due to different situations, have decided to return to higher education after a prolonged period of time, in the face of an educational system designed for optimal conditions for students. The disadvantage deepens when already in their adult stage, the time for academic dedication decreases due to their work occupations. This proposal aims to adapt the pedagogical model to their needs, specific needs in logic and mathematical operability, time, mobility, and location. Achieving this requires the design of a hybrid application based primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning, seeking to achieve the adaptation to the student through the correct training of neural networks, resulting in the identification of the specific requirements of each user and the selection and application of strategies, teaching techniques and content of the mathematics program to be learned and apprehended by the person who must remedy the shortcomings caused by the cessation and in many cases by a poor academic process. The following is a tour through the different aspects that support the proposal; from the need presented by students with academic cessation to the approach of a technological and specific solution for each individual starting from the generality of the causes to the possibility of giving a unique result thanks to the developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.","Mart\'{\i}nez, Efra\'{\i}n and Queiruga-Dios, Araceli and Rasteiro, Deolinda","Machine Learning, Apps, Mathematics, neural networks, Artificial intelligence, Academic Assignments, pedagogical model",10.1145/3486011.3486551,2021,5

inproceedings,"Implications of AI (Un-)Fairness in Higher Education Admissions: The Effects of Perceived AI (Un-)Fairness on Exit, Voice and Organizational Reputation","Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) is becoming increasingly important in all areas of social life. In higher education, machine-learning systems have manifold uses because they can efficiently process large amounts of student data and use these data to arrive at effective decisions. Despite the potential upsides of ADM systems, fairness concerns are gaining momentum in academic and public discourses. The criticism largely focuses on the disparate effects of ADM. That is, algorithms may not serve as objective and fair decision-makers but, rather, reproduce biases existing within the respective training data. This study adopted a different approach by focusing on individual perceptions of fairness. Specifically, we looked at two different dimensions of perceived fairness: (i) procedural fairness and (ii) distributive fairness. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 304) from a large German university, we tested whether students' assessments of fairness differ with respect to algorithmic vs. human decision-making (HDM) within the higher education context. Furthermore, we investigated whether fairness perceptions have subsequent effects on three different outcome variables, which are hugely important for universities: (1) exit, (2) voice, and (3) organizational reputation. The results of our survey suggest that participants evaluated ADM higher than HDM in terms of both procedural and distributive fairness. Concerning the subsequent effects of fairness perceptions, we find that (1) distributive fairness as well as procedural fairness perceptions have a negative impact on the intention to protest against an ADM system, whereas (2) only procedural fairness perceptions negatively affect the likelihood of exiting. Finally, (3) distributive fairness, but not procedural fairness perceptions have a positive effect on organizational reputation. For universities aiming to implement ADM systems, it is crucial, therefore, to take possible fairness issues and their further implications into account.","Marcinkowski, Frank and Kieslich, Kimon and Starke, Christopher and L\""{u}nich, Marco","higher education systems, reputation, exit, procedural fairness, voice, algorithmic decision making, distributive fairness, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3351095.3372867,2020,9
inproceedings,Curriculum Design for a Multidisciplinary Embedded Artificial Intelligence Course: (Abstract Only),"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are rapidly developing fields, garnering increased attention from the public, as well as academia and industry. Recent advances allow us to use our smart devices at home to control TVs, speakers, and lights. A smart speaker that is plugged into the wall can handle powerful processing that can service complex user requests. However, as we rely more and more on AI conveniences, we expect them to be at our disposal when we are moving around. In this poster, we present preliminary work on the development of a new upper-level undergraduate course open to all computer science, electrical engineering, and applied mathematics students at Wentworth Institute of Technology (WIT). The new course, titled Embedded AI (EAI), introduces topics from embedded systems, artificial intelligence, digital signal processing, linear algebra, and probability and statistics. The proposed course includes lectures introducing the theory behind each topic and laboratory assignments that provide the students with the hands-on experience. At the end of the semester, students develop an embedded AI project of their own. An interdisciplinary academic team of computer scientists and electrical and computer engineers has been working on a curriculum and researching different platforms, datasets and sensors that will ultimately enable students at WIT to develop an embedded device that can support AI tasks as well as give the students the practical skills that employers seek.

article,Research on the Influence of Artificial Intelligence Technology with Web 3.0 on Accounting Education and Its Countermeasures,"With the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI technology has been widely used in various fields of social and economic life, bringing great impact to various industries. AI is a section of computer science, a new science technology that studies and develops theories, methods, and application systems used. The development of artificial intelligence technology first has a profound impact on the development of the accounting industry, which leads to the change of the demand for accounting talents. This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students’ experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields.

inproceedings,Understanding How People Reason about Aesthetic Evaluations of Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are making remarkable achievements even in creative fields such as aesthetics. However, whether those outside the machine learning (ML) community can sufficiently interpret or agree with their results, especially in such highly subjective domains, is being questioned. In this paper, we try to understand how different user communities reason about AI algorithm results in subjective domains. We designed AI Mirror, a research probe that tells users the algorithmically predicted aesthetic scores of photographs. We conducted a user study of the system with 18 participants from three different groups: AI/ML experts, domain experts (photographers), and general public members.

inproceedings,A Review of Taxonomies of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Methods,"The recent surge in publications related to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has led to an almost insurmountable wall if one wants to get started or stay up to date with XAI. For this reason, articles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem to be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on this idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies, leading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this paper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies of XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as well as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is intended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies face. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not be sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend this problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions: a new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of XAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.","Speith, Timo","explainable artificial intelligence, XAI, interpretability, taxonomy, transparency, review, explainability",10.1145/3531146.3534639,2022,12

article,The Design of Reciprocal Learning Between Human and Artificial Intelligence,"The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.","Zagalsky, Alexey and Te'eni, Dov and Yahav, Inbal and Schwartz, David G. and Silverman, Gahl and Cohen, Daniel and Mann, Yossi and Lewinsky, Dafna","AI, feedback, cyber-security, accuracy, human intelligence, context, text classification, explainabilitiy",10.1145/3479587,2021,36

article,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creativity of Videos,"This study explored the impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) has on the evaluation of creative elements in artistic videos. The aim was to verify to what extent the use of an AI algorithm (Style Transfer) contributes to changes in the perceived creativity of the videos. Creativity was evaluated in six quantitative items (Likert-type scale) and one qualitative question (qualitative description of the creativity expressed in the video by two words or expressions). Six videos were shown to both control (N = 49) and experimental group (N = 52) aiming at determining possible differences in creativity assessment criteria. Furthermore, both groups contained experts (Experimental, N = 27; Control, N = 25) and non-experts (Experimental, N = 25; Control, N = 24). The first round of videos composed of six videos that were the same for both the experimental and control condition (used to check for bias). No significant differences were found. In a second round, six videos were shown with AI transformation (experimental condition) and without that transformation (control group). Results showed that in two cases the perceived creativity increased in experimental condition, in one case a decrease occurred. In most evaluations no differences were observed. Qualitative evaluations reinforce the absence of a general pattern of improvements in AI transformations. Altogether, the results emphasize the importance of human mediation in the application of AI in creative production: a hybrid approach, or rather, Hybrid Intelligence.","Rebelo, Ana Daniela Peres and In\^{e}s, Guedes De Oliveira and Damion, D.

inproceedings,Investigating Soft Skills Development at a Higher Education Institution in South Africa,"There seems to be a gap between what industry expect from employees on the one hand, and the soft skills of recent graduates from Higher Education Institutions on the other. The aim of this paper was to investigate if the perceptions of IT-students regarding their own soft skills have changed over a period of 3 years. To do this a questionnaire was distributed in 2019 to the same students who completed this questionnaire in 2016, and the results were analysed. The results of this study showed that although soft skills should increase from student's first year of study to their final year, this is not how the students perceive the development of their own soft skills. The biggest improvements were in the students' perceptions of their skills in cross-cultural relationships, work ethic, decision-making and critical thinking. The skills for client management, time management, professionalism and leadership were perceived as lower. The results confirmed that the IT-students' own perceptions are not a reliable way of measuring their soft skills. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of factors for further study, and according to this results the important soft skills were: Communication; Conflict management; Critical thinking; Interpersonal relations and teamwork; Leadership and Emotional intelligence; Multidisciplinary thinking; Professionalism and work ethic; and Self-management. These can now be used in further research on soft skills.","Taylor, Estelle","Soft skills, industry, higher education, information technology",10.1145/3371647.3371669,2020,7

inproceedings,Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Human Embryo Cell Cleavage Stages Analysis,"Many couples struggle with infertility, and opt for assisted reproductive technology (ART). Selecting the embryo with the highest chance of resulting in pregnancy, is one of the most critical steps of the ART procedure. The implantation potential of an embryo is associated with its morphology which includes assessing cell cleavage stages. Today, the assessment is mainly done manually by visual examination by embryologist and therefore is often subjective. Deep learning (DL) models can be used to automatically classify cell cleavage stages, and make the embryo assessment process efficient, objective. However, it is important that embryologists understand and trust the DL predictions, and in this paper we evaluate the potential of three explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. First, we compare the two XAI techniques Grad-CAM and LIME to identify important characteristics in embryo images associated with specific embryo cleavage stages. Both approaches identified biologically relevant morphological characteristics, but generally Grad-CAM was more consistent than LIME. Secondly, we suggest an approach on how to use the XAI technique SHAP to identify image characteristics that caused some images to be misclassified. The identified image characteristics had meaningful biological interpretation such as fragmentation. Overall the study demonstrates that DL in combination XAI can be useful in embryo assessment and selection.","Sharma, Akriti and Stensen, Mette H. and Delbarre, Erwan and Haugen, Trine B. and Hammer, Hugo L.","embryo cell cleavage stage, embryo morphology assessment, assisted reproduction technology, deep learning, explainable AI",10.1145/3512731.3534206,2022,8

Humanity has an absolutely vital dependence on a set of natural and artificial resources. The advancement of knowledge needed to adequately manage these resources has traditionally been achieved through specialization. In this strategy of dividing and ruling, what was gained in depth was lost in coverage. Yet, the most recent problems are intensely interdisciplinary, revealing that the previous specialization strategy is currently not wrong, but clearly insufficient. Strangely (or not), various courses in higher education continued to follow the traditional specialization strategy. As a result of this state-of-affairs, several conferences currently exist, both in the field of Education or in the field of Sustainability, but it has been particularly difficult to attract participants to deepen the theme of Teaching Sustainability.

inproceedings,Theories of Parenting and Their Application to Artificial Intelligence,"As machine learning (ML) systems have advanced, they have acquired more power over humans' lives, and questions about what values are embedded in them have become more complex and fraught. It is conceivable that in the coming decades, humans may succeed in creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) that thinks and acts with an open-endedness and autonomy comparable to that of humans. The implications would be profound for our species; they are now widely debated not just in science fiction and speculative research agendas but increasingly in serious technical and policy conversations. Much work is underway to try to weave ethics into advancing ML research. We think it useful to add the lens of parenting to these efforts, and specifically radical, queer theories of parenting that consciously set out to nurture agents whose experiences, objectives and understanding of the world will necessarily be very different from their parents'. We propose a spectrum of principles which might underpin such an effort; some are relevant to current ML research, while others will become more important if AGI becomes more likely. These principles may encourage new thinking about the development, design, training, and release into the world of increasingly autonomous agents.","Croeser, Sky and Eckersley, Peter","artificial intelligence, parenting, machine learning, ethics",10.1145/3306618.3314231,2019,6
inproceedings,The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Emotion Detection: A Study Based on the Effect of Parenting Style on Micro-Expression Recognition Ability of College Students,"Accurate recognition of micro-expressions facilitates emotional communication, and correct capture of expressions is associated with deception detection. The combination of artificial intelligence and psychology can be widely used in various fields such as national life, agricultural production, product development, and garrison construction. This study analyzes and explores whether there is a correlation between parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability, which can provide a basis for subsequent artificial intelligence to detect emotions. This paper mainly uses offline collection of micro-expression recognition data and filling out questionnaires at the same time to collect data and conduct survey research. A total of 175 questionnaires were collected, of which 175 were valid. 110 data of micro-expression recognition were collected, of which 100 were valid. The results found that there was a significant correlation between the parenting style and micro-expression recognition ability of college students. Specifically, the rejection dimension of parents was significantly and negatively correlated with micro-expression recognition ability. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of fields, among which the combination of machine learning and expression recognition can effectively improve the possibility of screening out suspicious people in specific situations.","Duan, Yuanyuan and Shen, Xunbing","micro-expression recognition, parenting style, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3500931.3500956,2021,5

article,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Image Analysis of Bacterial Cells and Biofilms,"The current study explores an artificial intelligence framework for measuring the structural features from microscopy images of the bacterial biofilms. <italic>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</italic> G20 (DA-G20) grown on mild steel surfaces is used as a model for sulfate reducing bacteria that are implicated in microbiologically influenced corrosion problems. Our goal is to automate the process of extracting the geometrical properties of the DA-G20 cells from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which is otherwise a laborious and costly process. These geometric properties are a biofilm phenotype that allow us to understand how the biofilm structurally adapts to the surface properties of the underlying metals, which can lead to better corrosion prevention solutions. We adapt two deep learning models: (a) a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model to achieve semantic segmentation of the cells, (d) a mask region-convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) model to achieve instance segmentation of the cells. These models are then integrated with moment invariants approach to measure the geometric characteristics of the segmented cells. Our numerical studies confirm that the Mask-RCNN and DCNN methods are 227x and 70x faster respectively, compared to the traditional method of manual identification and measurement of the cell geometric properties by the domain experts.","Ragi, Shankarachary and Rahman, Md Hafizur and Duckworth, Jamison and Jawaharraj, Kalimuthu and Chundi, Parvathi and Gadhamshetty, Venkataramana",No data,10.1109/TCBB.2021.3138304,2021,11

A Perception Bias Towards Artificial Intelligence?,"Via generative adversarial networks (GANs), artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced many areas, especially the artistic field, as symbol of a human task. In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.","Ragot, Martin and Martin, Nicolas and Cojean, Salom\'{e}","GAN, artificial intelligence, bias, AI, can, painting, computational creativity, authorship, arts",10.1145/3334480.3382892,2020,10

inproceedings,Redefining Teacher Qualification in the Artificial Intelligence Era: A Professional Capital Perspective,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is challenging teacher professionalism, thus how to define a teacher in the AI era has become a hot topic in education. Many studies adopted a teacher literacy perspective on redefining a teacher for artificial intelligence in education(AIEd), while ignoring the sociological observation of the challenges faced with teachers in their professional field. This paper was framed by the core concept “professional capital” from sociology, the revolutionary power in the field, analyzed the trend of education field evolving from traditional education to AIEd. Based on the analysis, the paper proposed that, teacher professional capital is the impetus that empowers teachers to reconstruct their professional identity in the AI era. Teacher professional capital for AIEd mainly manifests itself in three forms: teacher human capital(THC), representing teacher agency to teach with AI at the individual level; teacher social capital(TSC), representing the synergetic resources circulating in teachers’ social networks at the interpersonal system; teacher decisional capital(TDC), representing the collaborative decision-making power at the human-AI level. In teachers’ professional practice, THC empowers teachers the capability to transit from traditional education field to AIEd field; TSC endows teachers the power to leverage other people's professional capital to teach with AI; TDC ensures teachers professional autonomy to teach with AI in a reasonable and legal manner.","Liu, Xiaolin and Li, Yaoqing","Education Field, Pedagogy Innovation, Teacher Professional Development, Teacher Professional Capital, Artificial Intelligence in Education",10.1145/3524383.3524405,2022,5

article,Early Exploration of MOOCs in the U.S. Higher Education: An Absorptive Capacity Perspective,"Advanced information technologies have enabled Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which have the potential to transform higher education around the world. Why are some institutions eager to embrace this technology-enabled model of teaching, while others remain reluctant to jump aboard? Applying the theory of absorptive capacity, we study the role of a university's educational IT capabilities in becoming an early MOOC producer. Examining the history of MOOC offerings by U.S. colleges and universities, we find that prior IT capabilities, such as (1) the use of Web 2.0, social media and other interactive tools for teaching and (2) experience with distance education and hybrid teaching, are positively associated with the early exploration of MOOCs. Interestingly, we also find that the effect of educational IT capabilities is moderated by social integration mechanisms and activation triggers. For example, when instructional IT supporting services are highly decentralized, educational IT capabilities have a greater impact on the probability of a university offering a MOOC. In addition, for colleges facing an adverse environment, such as those experience a decline in college applications, the effect of IT capabilities on the exploration of MOOCs is much stronger.","Huang, Peng and Lucas, Henry C.","absorptive capacity, distance learning, MOOC, online education, IT capability",10.1145/3456295,2021,28

A major offensive strategy exploits steganography to conceal scripts or URLs, which can be used to steal credentials or retrieve additional payloads. A recent example is the attack campaign against the Magento e-commerce platform, where a web skimmer has been cloaked in favicons to steal payment information of users. In this paper, we propose an approach based on deep learning for detecting threats using least significant bit steganography to conceal malicious PHP scripts and URLs in favicons. Experimental results, conducted on a realistic dataset with both legitimate and compromised images, demonstrated the effectiveness of our solution. Specifically, our model detects ∼ 100% of the compromised favicons when examples of various malicious payloads are provided in the learning phase. Instead, it achieves an overall accuracy of ∼ 90% when in the presence of new payloads or alternative encoding schemes.","Guarascio, Massimo and Zuppelli, Marco and Cassavia, Nunziato and Caviglione, Luca and Manco, Giuseppe","malware, magecart, artificial intelligence, steganography, information hiding",10.1145/3538969.3544437,2022,7

Though these guidelines are becoming increasingly common, they have been criticized for a lack of impact on industrial practice. There seems to be a gap between research and practice in the area, though its exact nature remains unknown. In this paper, we present a gap analysis of the current state of the art by comparing practices of 39 companies that work with AI systems to the seven key requirements for trustworthy AI presented in the “The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. The key finding of this paper is that there is indeed notable gap between AI ethics guidelines and practice. Especially practices considering the novel requirements for software development, requirements of societal and environmental well-being and diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness were not tackled by companies.","Vakkuri, Ville and Kemell, Kai-Kristian and Tolvanen, Joel and Jantunen, Marianna and Halme, Erika and Abrahamsson, Pekka","Responsible AI, Artificial Intelligence Ethics, Gap Analysis",10.1145/3530019.3530030,2022,10

A corpus-based error analysis methodology was adopted. From the Chinese Learner English Corpus (CLEC), all word formation errors tagged as [fm2] were collected, processed and analyzed. It was found that Chinese college students mainly made four types of errors in word formation. The most common word formation errors in Chinese college students’ writings were erroneous irregular inflections and compound words. The author argues that overgeneralization and the complex processes of English word formation are the main causes of these errors. The findings are significant in helping Chinese English learners identify their errors in word formation and telling teachers what errors learners have made in word formation.","Xia, Lixin","Word formation, English learning and teaching, Error analysis, Corpus linguistics, Interlanguage",10.1145/3463531.3463546,2021,6

It is suggested that try to treat the different types of universities differently in the approval of projects, and strengthen the approval of projects in orientation of running colleges and universities, and strengthen the training mode of talents. Further, we should strengthen the promotion and exchange of outstanding research results in colleges and universities so as to maximize the economic benefits of the achievements.","Xu, Xin-Ai","Project data, Teaching reform project, Empirical research",10.1145/3386415.3387100,2020,4
inproceedings,An Exploratory Diagnosis of Artificial Intelligence Risks for a Responsible Governance.,"Our lives have been increasingly filled with technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI), whether at home, in public spaces, in social organizations, or in services. Like other technologies, adopting this emerging technology also requires society’s attention to the challenges that may arise from it. The media brought to the public some unexpected results from using these technologies, for example, the unfairness case in the COMPAS system. It became more evident that these technologies can have unintended consequences. In particular, in the public interest domain, these unintended consequences and their origin are a challenge for public policies, governance, and responsible AI. This work aims to identify the technological and ethical risks in data-driven decision systems based on AI and conduct a diagnosis of these risks and their perception. To do that, we use a triangulation of methods. In the first stage, a search on Web of Science has been performed. We consider all the 412 papers. The second stage corresponds to a analysis of experts. The papers have been classified according to the relevance to the topic by the experts. In the third stage, we use the survey method and include risk insights from stage two in our questions. We found 24 concerns which arise from the perspective of the ethical and technological risk perspective. The perception of participants regarding the level of concern they have with the risks of a data-driven system based on AI is high than their perception of society’s concern. Fairness is considered the risk whose perception is more severe. Fairness, Bias, Accountability, Interpretability, and Explainability are considered the most relevant concepts for a responsible AI. Consequently, also the most relevant for responsible governance of AI.","Teixeira, S\'{o}nia and Rodrigues, Jos\'{e} and Veloso, Bruno and Gama, Jo\~{a}o","Ethical Risks, Governance, Technological Risks, Risk Perception, Diagnosis of the Situation, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3560107.3560298,2022,7
inproceedings,Investigating the Benefits of Applying Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Enhance Learning Experiences in Capstone Courses,"This research seeks to improve the learning experiences in Software Engineering Programs using Virtual Assistants based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Students of Software Engineering Capstone Courses face real world situations and challenges that grant them valuable experiences for their professional preparation. However, since this knowledge is acquired through real-life exposure projects, it is difficult to transmit it among different generations of students. In consequence, all the gained knowledge, experiences, and computer codes developed are lost and cannot be reused outside the project context when they finish their assignment at the end of the semester. To address this challenge, this thesis considers the development of AI based virtual assistants applied in higher education, in a form of a lesson learned system, a recommender system integrated with a chatbot, to help students , solve problems similar to those they face in the different stages of their software project development by recommending previous lessons learned. The innovative contribution lies in the implementation of the described techniques from the state-of-art artificial intelligence field in an educational platform with the goal to leverage the experience gained during years of the teaching a Capstone Course in Software Engineering to new student generations who might benefit from this universal knowledge gained previously, in order to assist software engineering students to enhance their learning experience.","A.

inproceedings,With a Rise in Computing Disciplines Comes a Greater Choice of Computing Degrees in Higher Education,"Higher education institutions (HEIs) internationally are increasingly recognising the importance of understanding student study choices. This is especially true in the field of computing in which skills shortages in the labour market are high but so too are student dropout rates. Loss of interest in the computing field has been reported among the reasons for students dropping out. The aim of this study is to offer a fresh perspective of the factors influencing undergraduate student’s interest and choice of specialisation in computing. Previous studies have mainly focused on five ACM-identified computing disciplines: Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Software Engineering. With the ever-growing nature of computing, two more disciplines recently emerged: Cybersecurity and Data Science. HEIs continuously endeavour to expand computing programmes into specialist areas within these disciplines such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, gaming, robotics and creative computing. For prospective students, this maze of options can make for a difficult decision. 137 first-year computing students were invited to participate in a mixed-methods survey to explore their choices around cybersecurity and other newer specialisations. The results of the survey were matched with findings from recent literature, and show that personal interest, family, media, career prospects and prior experiences still influence student choices, with media appearing to have a greater impact compared to earlier studies. HEIs can use this when developing effective recruitment strategies in computing.","Redmond, Fiona","computing education, specialisations, disciplines, computing, student choices",10.1145/3564721.3565946,2022,11

inproceedings,Accessible PDFs: Applying Artificial Intelligence for Automated Remediation of STEM PDFs,"People with visual impairments use assistive technology, e.g., screen readers, to navigate and read PDFs. However, such screen readers need extra information about the logical structure of the PDF, such as the reading order, header levels, and mathematical formulas, described in readable form to navigate the document in a meaningful way. This logical structure can be added to a PDF with tags. Creating tags for a PDF is time-consuming, and requires awareness and expert knowledge. Hence, most PDFs are left untagged, and as a result, they are poorly readable or unreadable for people who rely on screen readers. STEM documents are particularly problematic with their complex document structure and complicated mathematical formulae. These inaccessible PDFs present a major barrier for people with visual impairments wishing to pursue studies or careers in STEM fields, who cannot easily read studies and publications from their field. The goal of this Ph.D. is to apply artificial intelligence for document analysis to reasonably automate the remediation process of PDFs and present a solution for large mathematical formulae accessibility in PDFs. With these new methods, the Ph.D. research aims to lower barriers to creating accessible scientific PDFs, by reducing the time, effort, and expertise necessary to do so, ultimately facilitating greater access to scientific documents for people with visual impairments.","Schmitt-Koopmann, Felix M. and Huang, Elaine M. and Darvishy, Alireza","Page Object Detection, Document Analysis, Tagged PDF, Math Viewer, PDF Accessibility, Accessibility, PDF/UA, Formula Recognition, Reading Order",10.1145/3517428.3550407,2022,6

While most surveys focus on ransomware detection using Machine learning techniques, this survey concentrates on Ransomware techniques that apply the sub-domains of Artificial Intelligence. This paper reviews detection techniques that employ Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques, which are sub-fields of AI for ransomware detection. Though the reviewed works have good detection rates, a few open concerns are identified and discussed. The primary objective of the review is to highlight concerns of the proposed system that prevent it from becoming effective in real-time systems.","Sneha, Monica and Arya, Arti and Agarwal, Pooja","Natural language processing, Machine Learning Techniques, Ransomware Detection",10.1145/3447654.3447659,2021,8

inproceedings,A Pedagogical Approach in Interleaving Software Quality Concerns at an Artificial Intelligence Course,"The software engineering industry is an everchanging domain requiring professionals to have a good knowledge base and adaptability skills.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved substantial success in enhancing program analysis techniques and applications, including bug prediction. It is a promising direction by applying advanced Machine Learning techniques into suitable software engineering tasks. The main goal of this paper is to propose a pedagogical interdisciplinary approach that pave the path for developing an e-learning platform serving to check the quality of the source code that students wrote by means of Artificial Intelligence techniques. By putting into practice this proposal, we are planning to show the students how to combine concepts learned from two different courses. The first step of this approach would be part of the Advanced Programming Methods, a Software Engineering related course, where students learn about the importance of writing good quality code and use software metrics as a mean of software quality assessment. Then, the following steps will be integrated into the Artificial Intelligence course, where students learn about different Machine Learning algorithms and how to apply them to solve practical problems. Thus, as an applicability in this respect, students use the metric values calculated for their projects developed at Advanced Programming Methods course as lab assignments and also to train (at Artificial Intelligence class) a bug detection model able to estimate the quality of new codebases. The proposed approach is helpful for both students and teachers. On one side, it helps the students understand the importance of writing clean, high-quality code. And on the other side, it helps teachers in their evaluation process by giving them time to focus on different aspects of homework than the code quality.","Cernau, Laura Diana and Dio\c{s}an, Laura Silvia and undefinederban, Camelia","code quality, software engineering, software metrics",10.1145/3548660.3561332,2022,7

inproceedings,What Do Governments Plan in the Field of Artificial Intelligence? Analysing National AI Strategies Using NLP,"The primary goal of this paper is to explore how Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP) can assist in reviewing, understanding, and drawing conclusions from text datasets. We explore NLP techniques for the analysis and the extraction of useful information from the text of twelve national strategies on artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, we are using a set of machine learning algorithms in order to (a) extract the most significant keywords and summarize each strategy document, (b) discover and assign topics to each document, and (c) cluster the strategies based on their pair-wise similarity. Using the results of the analysis, we discuss the findings and highlight critical issues that emerge from the national strategies for artificial intelligence, such as the importance of the data ecosystem for the development of AI, the increasing considerations about ethical and safety issues, as well as the growing ambition of many countries to lead in the AI race. Utilizing the LDA topic model, we were able to reveal the distributions of thematic sub-topics among the strategic documents. The topic modelling distributions were then used along with other document similarity measures as an input for the clustering of the strategic documents into groups. The results revealed three clusters of countries with a visible differentiation between the strategies of China and Japan on the one hand and the Scandinavian strategies (plus the German and the Luxemburgish) one on the other. The former promote technology and innovation-driven development plans in order to integrate AI with the economy, while the latter share a common view regarding the role of the public sector both as a promoter and investor but also as a user and beneficiary of AI, and give a higher priority to the ethical &amp; safety issues that are connected to the development of AI.","Papadopoulos, Theodoros and Charalabidis, Yannis","topic modelling, Automated Text Analysis, NLP, AI strategies, machine learning, document similarity",10.1145/3428502.3428514,2020,12

inproceedings,Imagining Artificial Intelligence Applications with People with Visual Disabilities Using Tactile Ideation,"There has been a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies co-opted by or designed for people with visual disabilities. Researchers and engineers have pushed technical boundaries in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, location inference, and wearable computing. But what do people with visual disabilities imagine as their own technological future? To explore this question, we developed and carried out tactile ideation workshops with participants in the UK and India. Our participants generated a large and diverse set of ideas, most focusing on ways to meet needs related to social interaction. In some cases, this was a matter of recognizing people. In other cases, they wanted to be able to participate in social situations without foregrounding their disability. It was striking that this finding was consistent across UK and India despite substantial cultural and infrastructural differences. In this paper, we describe a new technique for working with people with visual disabilities to imagine new technologies that are tuned to their needs and aspirations. Based on our experience with these workshops, we provide a set of social dimensions to consider in the design of new AI technologies: social participation, social navigation, social maintenance, and social independence. We offer these social dimensions as a starting point to forefront users' social needs and desires as a more deliberate consideration for assistive technology design.","Morrison, Cecily and Cutrell, Edward and Dhareshwar, Anupama and Doherty, Kevin and Thieme, Anja and Taylor, Alex","ai, design, accessibility, blind, artificial intelligence, multicultural, ideation, visually impaired",10.1145/3132525.3132530,2017,10

It showed how news can generate fear in people, or even misinform, as is the case of fake news. For these reasons, it is key to determine the relevance a story can have. Predicting the impact, will allow us to pay more attention to those news that can affect people more, avoiding misinformation and fake news. However, the problem is that there is no way of predicting the impact that a press article can have. Therefore, the aim of this work is to implement a machine learning model that allows us to predict, with the best possible accuracy, the virality of online press articles (defining virality as the amount of clicks that an article receives when it is opened). In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM methodology, which focuses on machine learning projects. The best obtained result corresponds to the model where the core of the architecture was based on BERT, a pre-trained model, which, for a pair of press articles headlines, predicted whether the first headline would be more viral than the second one. On the other hand, the evaluation was carried out by comparing the amount of clicks for a pair of articles. For a practitioner point of view, digital marketers can use our results to select the best words for their online marketing campaign. For a theoretical point of view, our results present an innovative natural language processing approach based on one of the best breed of Neural network models (BERT).","L.

inproceedings,Application Research of Basketball Physical Training Based on Artificial Intelligence,"The purpose of athletes playing basketball is to shoot and score. Basketball requires athletes to have the ability to quickly change offense and defense, and have strong physical fitness. Basketball is a combination of skills and physical fitness. Athletes who want to use superb skills flexibly in the game must have corresponding physical fitness. Physical fitness is the basic condition for athletes to play for a long time. With the continuous development of basketball, the confrontation intensity in the basketball game is becoming more and more fierce, and the physical fitness requirements of basketball players are getting higher and higher. This article first analyzes the current research status of basketball physical training, then studies the training process and specific characteristics of basketball physical training, and finally designs the experiment. Taking 4 basketball teams from 4 major colleges and universities in a certain city in China as the research object, through the four teams were randomly selected into a control group and an experimental group. The control group used the previous training method, and the experimental group used the new training method. After the experiment, the teams in the experimental group and the control group were tested on physical fitness indicators. The test results showed that the improvement of the experimental group's performance on all indicators was greater than that of the control group.","Liu, Yuanyuan and Wang, Shasha",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483005,2021,5
inproceedings,Exploring Why Underrepresented Students Are Less Likely to Study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,"There is little research on why underrepresented minorities are less likely to specifically study Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI). We surveyed 159 undergraduate students about their interest in, exposure to, and personal views on ML/AI in order to explore variations in responses by self-reported gender and race/ethnicity groups. We found that students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are ~6 times less likely to take a traditional ML/AI course than those not underrepresented by race/ethnicity, but no significant difference was found between gender representation. Additionally, students underrepresented by race/ethnicity are more likely to report interest in social, cultural, and political impacts of ML/AI rather than the more technical aspects of ML/AI itself, which is a prevalent interest of students not underrepresented by race/ethnicity. We explore potential reasoning for this difference through further analysis of their survey responses. Encouragingly, we find that regardless of representational status 72.0% of students who report lack of interest in a traditional introductory course are interested in a ML/AI course that focuses more on the political, philosophical, and ethical issues raised by ML/AI and its impacts on society. Our findings suggest that a 'CS Principles"" style introductory ML/AI course, emphasizing social and political impacts, could be an effective way to promote diversity in ML/AI.","Barretto, Daphne and LaChance, Julienne and Burton, Emanuelle and Liao, Soohyun Nam","diversity, machine learning, underrepresented students, race and ethnicity, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3430665.3456332,2021,7
inproceedings,Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms,"Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications.The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain U.S. geolocations.","Pandey, Akshat and Caliskan, Aylin","geolocation, prediction, disparate impact, AI ethics, algorithmic bias, price discrimination",10.1145/3461702.3462561,2021,12

inproceedings,An Artificial Intelligence Method for Digital Government Assessment: An Application of Neural Networks Analysis of a Ranking of Digital Government of Mexican States,"Development of accurate measurement systems to assess digital government advance is a critical topic of digital agenda of academia and governments around the world. There are several quantitative approaches such as rankings and indicators that have contributed to measure the progress of digital government initiatives in the public sector, but more sophisticated computational tools are usually unexploited. This article proposes a computational multi-parametric analysis of multiple metrics of digital government advance using a computational technique, the neural networks, for the analysis of the evolution of digital government ranking of Mexican states during the period 2009-2015. Neural networks analysis has been used in different areas such as scientometric performance profiles, and disciplines like physics, chemistry, management, economics and demography. The neural networks analysis helps to identify clusters of characterizations that represents digital government advance patterns of performance. It also locates various profiles of digital government progress with similar patterns of performance and atypical behaviors (outliers) which are difficult to identify with classical tools. The results of this computational technique are robust showing that artificial intelligence tools are useful instruments to evaluate digital government advance overtime.","Villase\~{n}or-Garc\'{\i}a, E.

inproceedings,An Artificial Intelligence-Based Model-Driven Approach for Exposing off-Nominal Behaviors,"With an increase in the automation of cyber-physical systems (e.g., automated vehicles and robots), quality problems such as off-nominal behaviors (ONBs) have also increased. While there are techniques that can find ONBs at the requirements engineering stage as it reduces the cost of addressing defects early in development, they do not meet the current industrial needs and often ignore functional safety. These techniques suffer from limitations such as scalability, need for significant human effort and inability to detect overlooked or unknown ONBs. To address these limitations we need a technique that analyzes requirements with respect to functional safety, but with less human effort. To achieve this, we propose our artificial intelligence-based model-driven methodology that provides a means to find ONBs during requirements engineering with minimal human effort. Our methodology utilizes existing approaches such as causal component model (CCM) and systems theoretic process analysis (STPA). We describe the details of each step of our approach and how our approach would support finding ONBs. Using our research and the results of our studies, we intend to provide empirical evidence that considering ONBs during requirements engineering stage and analyzing requirements with respect to functional safety can help create more robust designs and higher-quality products.","Madala, Kaushik",No data,10.1109/ICSE-Companion.2019.00085,2019,4

inproceedings,Modelling Mobile Signal Strength by Combining Geospatial Big Data and Artificial Intelligence,"Estimating mobile signal strength accurately is a crucial task for network providers and their customers. However, current methodologies to estimate mobile signal strength present limitations in their practical implementation (i.e. physical based models), portability (i.e. spatial interpolation methods), simplicity and accuracy (i.e. path loss models). In this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of geospatial Big Data and advanced Artificial Intelligence to predict mobile signal strength at scale. Particularly, we used open access geo-spatial information about weather, tree coverage, land use, imperviousness, altitude and network infrastructure (i.e. a total of 174 features) to train and test uncertainty-aware artificial neural networks to predict mobile signal strength on data from the NetBravo crowdsourcing platform across all the United Kingdom (UK). Our model scored a best performance of 7.9 (standard deviation of 0.2) dBm for Root Mean Squared Error and 5.7 (standard deviation of 0.4) dBm for the Mean Absolute Error. Feature importance analysis showed that mobile cell tower characteristics and geospatial features showing the distribution of imperviousness and tree cover density over the line of sight between the mobile cell tower and the receiver as well as relative humidity were among the top 20 most important features.","Fraccaro, Paolo and Benatan, Matt and Reusch, Katharina and Fare, Clyde and Edwards, Blair and Pyzer-Knapp, Edward","Mobile Signal Strength, Geospatial, Big Data, Artificial Neural Networks Learning",10.1145/3448823.3448879,2021,5

inproceedings,A Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques Used for Urban Automatic Incident Detection Systems,"Over the past decades, tremendous research efforts have been proposed to deploy Automatic Incident Detection Systems (AIDSs) onto urban roads. As a result, new challenges to the research community have been introduced to enhance the AIDS performances. To overcome these challenges, and to improve the efficiency and safety of road traffic, attention has been drawn to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques as a solution. However, choosing appropriate AI technologies to process real-time traffic data is an area that needs spotlighting. The aim of this paper is to discuss recent advancements in urban AIDSs based on AI techniques. We carried out a review for twelve previous AIDS study proposed since 2009. We compared these AIDSs in term of traffic data sources, input variables, and type of incident. Also, a comparison of simulators, techniques and the evaluation metrics has been used. The results indicated that hybrid AI techniques reported the best detection performances. In this context, fixed or fusion data sources were also given good results compared to others. This review shows reliable results of AI classification techniques applied in AIDS approaches. This finding urges to continue improve the performances of the proposed AI techniques. In future research, testing others AI techniques with smart technologies may increase the incident detection efficiency.","Samia, Hireche and Abdeslem, Dennai","inductive loop detectors, Urban automatic incident detection, floating car data, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3384544.3384557,2020,6
inproceedings,The Relationship of Higher Education Access with Final Marks in a Core Chemical Engineering Topic,"This present work cracks to understand the relationship between final marks in a topic with competences that are core of Chemical Engineering and students’ access grades to a Portuguese Higher Education Institution (HEI). The study is based on data gathered through a questionnaire concerning students’ perceptions about assessment and teaching-learning methodologies in four academic years (2016-2017 to 2019-2020). The student´s access grades were included in the questionnaire since 2018-19 academic year allowing to establish a relationship with the final marks obtained in a core Chemical Engineering Topic, Fluid Mechanics. From the analysis made, it can be said that students who obtained higher access grades to HEI may have also a higher Chemical Engineering curricular unit final mark, although the low linear relationship obtained (r =0.45) for the year 2019-20.","Sena-Esteves, M.

However, due to the outdated cultivation mode of the Master of Artificial Intelligence Software Engineering, there are few or no courses related to artificial intelligence in terms of curriculum setting, and the textbooks are not updated in time, which makes students lack of grasp of cutting-edge knowledge and scientific research methods. In terms of scientific research practice, it is simple in form and low in technology content, which leads to the insufficiency of students' comprehensive engineering application ability, and becomes the bottleneck of the cultivation of senior talents in software engineering under the background of artificial intelligence. With four modules of scientific selection system, multi-module curriculum system, practical training system and school-enterprise cooperation mechanism, the ""Four-in-One"" training mode is constructed to cultivate high-level, open, compound and international software talents.","Duan, Yuanpeng and Gong, Weixin",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495332,2022,4

inproceedings,Preconceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Their Change through Co-Constructed Explorations,"Most explainable AI (XAI) approaches focus on mathematically correct and complete explanations. In contrast to that, everyday explanations are social practices that are influenced by many factors, e.g. the social and institutional context of the explanation. Everyday explanations are therefore co-constructed by both the explainer and the explainee. Assuming that everyday co-constructed explanations are easy to understand for citizens, they can help to make AI understandable for people who do not have affinity for technology. In this context, concrete and simplified examples that are adapted to the needs of the learner can reduce the complexity of the explanation furthermore. This Ph.D. project investigates the effects of co-constructed explanations created while exploring notional machines on the mental models of AI of everyday people.

inproceedings,Towards Accountability in the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Public Administrations,"We argue that the phenomena of distributed responsibility, induced acceptance, and acceptance through ignorance constitute instances of imperfect delegation when tasks are delegated to computationally-driven systems. Imperfect delegation challenges human accountability. We hold that both direct public accountability via public transparency and indirect public accountability via transparency to auditors in public organizations can be both instrumentally ethically valuable and required as a matter of deontology from the principle of democratic self-government. We analyze the regulatory content of 16 guideline documents about the use of AI in the public sector, by mapping their requirements to those of our philosophical account of accountability, and conclude that while some guidelines refer processes that amount to auditing, it seems that the debate would benefit from more clarity about the nature of the entitlement of auditors and the goals of auditing, also in order to develop ethically meaningful standards with respect to which different forms of auditing can be evaluated and compared.","Loi, Michele and Spielkamp, Matthias","artificial intelligence, public administrations, accountability, AI guidelines",10.1145/3461702.3462631,2021,10

inproceedings,Toward Non-Intuition-Based Machine and Artificial Intelligence Ethics: A Deontological Approach Based on Modal Logic,"We propose a deontological approach to machine (or AI) ethics that avoids some weaknesses of an intuition-based system, such as that of Anderson and Anderson. In particular, it has no need to deal with conflicting intuitions, and it yields a more satisfactory account of when autonomy should be respected. We begin with a ""dual standpoint'' theory of action that regards actions as grounded in reasons and therefore as having a conditional form that is suited to machine instructions. We then derive ethical principles based on formal properties that the reasons must exhibit to be coherent, and formulate the principles using quantified modal logic. We conclude that deontology not only provides a more satisfactory basis for machine ethics but endows the machine with an ability to explain its actions, thus contributing to transparency in AI.","Hooker, John N. and Kim, Tae Wan N.","modal logic, explainable ai, deontology, machine ethics, autonomous machine ethics, kantian ai, artificial intelligence ethics, accountable ai",10.1145/3278721.3278753,2018,7

A similar degree of change applies to market dynamics, volatile customer requirements, shortened product lifecycles and the amounts of environmental uncertainties in the context of organisational innovation management. Strategic Foresight (SF) offers an approach to deal with environmental uncertainty and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has huge potential to support SF by means of collecting and analysing data as well as automatizing information research and analysis tasks. The current paper analyses the potentials and organisational practices at the nexus of AI and SF. In the form of expert interviews, current practices and expected future application potentials of AI in SF are analysed. Furthermore, challenges and potential weaknesses of AI in this context are discussed and an outlook on potential future visions of AI in SF from practitioners’ points of view is provided. The results show that currently AI is only applied in a very limited way to support SF, mostly in terms of supporting trend and customer data analysis. However, the results also indicate high future potentials of AI in SF. Experts agree that AI will have a high impact on SF, mainly in terms of automatizing information research and data analysis tasks and subsequently allowing employees to focus on more complex tasks in SF which require human abilities like intuition, creativity, courage and entrepreneurial thinking.t.","Brandtner, Patrick and Mates, Marius","Artificial Intelligence, Corporate Foresight, Innovation Management, Strategic Foresight, Data Analytics, Digitalization",10.1145/3481127.3481177,2021,7

Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chipss (MPSoCss). 2/ The support for customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end 24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoCs. The impact of customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment.","Desnos, Karol and Sourbier, Nicolas and Raumer, Pierre-Yves and Gesny, Olivier and Pelcat, Maxime",No data,10.1145/3441110.3441575,2021,9
inproceedings,Analyzing Opinions of Subscribers about Artificial Intelligence and Manpower Issues in Newspaper Coverages,"The significance of mass media is that of setting news agenda and facilitating the public opinion on the basis of this agenda setting. Thus, the role of mass media is not only an intermediary body for disseminating information to the public, but also influence on the manner, in which people consider and view society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and manpower issues are deserved to setting news agenda because the issues are critical agenda of the current era. However, the previous literatures pointed out that newspaper coverages mainly covered with the business and industrial aspect of AI issues and less attention has been given to the analysis of specific frames from public opinion. Thus, this study aims to address the opinion of subscribers about newspaper coverage on AI and manpower issues. This study employs two approaches, quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results of quantitative analysis on topic model point to three frames, namely, humanity, society, and robotics. The study then applied these frames as the basis of qualitative analysis. Subscribers are mainly concerned about a lack of humanity and the violation of human dignity due to the implementation of AI. Additionally, subscribers discussed the manner, in which AI is changing the meaning of work. In terms of robotics, opinions were clearly polarized into positive and negative: Positive points mainly viewed the benefits of robots, such as addressing the shortage in labors, eliminating heavy labor, becoming friends with human beings, among others. Conversely, the negative opinions mainly associated with the fear against robots. This study suggested that the government needs to utilize means of implementation to mitigate the user's sense of aversion against AI. Additionally, the government needs to delineate the future society toward co-existence and cooperation between machine and humans.","Nagano, Aki","Artificial Intelligence, public opinion, topic model, newspaper coverages, Manpower issues",10.1145/3560107.3560137,2022,6

inproceedings,Eliminating Artificial-Natural Dichotomy A Formal Study on a Core Cognitive Process in Artificial Intelligence,"The core of this paper is to provide a framework for analyzing the naturalness and artificiality in terms of the new rising of square of opposition, which have fruitful results in doing conceptual analysis in many different disciplines. In this framework, we can deal with two perspectives of analyzing the concepts of naturalness and artificiality: (1) when we focus on intension perspective, the logical relations of natural- ness and artificiality by using the formal square of opposition with na\""{\i}ve set theory, the trivialization of the dichotomy of artificiality and naturalness in artificial intelligence will be made; (2) when we focus on extension perspective, with the concept of being natural in tandem with the concept of being artificial, we find that we need to elaborate the inherent inter- inclusive relationship between artificiality and naturalness, either by logical hexagon or by the SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation that we define, and a paradigm shift from GOFAI to emergentism AI occurs. On the above basis, we suggest that SQ-NAT-ART with the K-transformation will be a good preparatory work for the research of naturalness and artificiality.","Chen, Shih-Hsun and Fu, Tzu-Keng","Artificial Intelligence, Emer-gentism, Square of Opposition, Logical Hexagon, Aristotle's Logic",10.1145/3080845.3080866,2017,6
inproceedings,A Redhead Walks into a Bar: Experiences of Writing Fiction with Artificial Intelligence,"Human creativity has been often aided and supported by artificial tools, spanning traditional tools such as ideation cards, pens, and paper, to computed and software. Tools for creativity are increasingly using artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report on two progressive – not comparative – autoethnographic studies to attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator.","Ghajargar, Maliheh and Bardzell, Jeffrey and Lagerkvist, Love","Storytelling, Creative writing, Artificial creativity, GPT-3, Creativity tool, AI co-creativity",10.1145/3569219.3569418,2022,12

The Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory's Outreach Summer (SAILORS), a two-week non-residential free summer program, recruits high school girls to computer science, specifically to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The program was organized by graduate student and professor volunteers. The goals of the pilot program are to increase interest in AI, contextualize technically rigorous AI concepts through societal impact, and address barriers that could discourage 10th grade girls from pursuing computer science. In this paper we describe the curriculum designed to achieve these goals. Survey results show students had a statistically significant increase in technical knowledge, interest in pursuing careers in AI, and confidence in succeeding in AI and computer science. Additionally, survey results show that the majority of the students found new role models, faculty support, and a sense of community in AI and computer science.","Vachovsky, Marie E. and Wu, Grace and Chaturapruek, Sorathan and Russakovsky, Olga and Sommer, Richard and Fei-Fei, Li","k-12 education, summer camps, outreach, computer science education, artificial intelligence, recruiting women, gender and diversity",10.1145/2839509.2844620,2016,6
article,Blending Human and Artificial Intelligence to Support Autistic Children’s Social Communication Skills,"This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.","Porayska-Pomsta, Ka\'{s}ka and Alcorn, Alyssa M. and Avramides, Katerina and Beale, Sandra and Bernardini, Sara and Foster, Mary Ellen and Frauenberger, Christopher and Good, Judith and Guldberg, Karen and Keay-Bright, Wendy and Kossyvaki, Lila and Lemon, Oliver and Mademtzi, Marilena and Menzies, Rachel and Pain, Helen and Rajendran, Gnanathusharan and Waller, Annalu and Wass, Sam and Smith, Tim J.","neurodiversity, intelligent learning environments, artificially intelligent agent, Autism, social communication",10.1145/3271484,2018,35

inproceedings,Investigation and Research on the Cultivation of Students' English Interests under Artificial Intelligence Technology,"With the vigorous development of artificial intelligence, there are abundant types of learning resources and various learning methods. The use of digital resources in the context of the Internet in learning can stimulate students’ interest in English learning, improve their English listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills, and effectively improve the efficiency of junior high school English classroom learning. Different people have different learning effects in the same learning environment because their own qualities are certainly one factor, and the more important factor is the different attitudes of the learners, that is, whether the learners are interested in learning. Interest can arouse students’ curiosity and eager thirst for knowledge, and interest can promote students’ active learning, spontaneous learning, and diligent learning more than intelligence and skills. For the English learning of junior high school students, interest is the first condition for them to learn English well. Only when students are interested in English learning, can they actively participate in English learning, and gradually become more and more interested in the specific English learning process. Through the questionnaire survey of middle school students, we can understand their tendency to attribute to English learning performance in the process of English learning. This paper aims to investigate whether middle school students are more interested in English, the higher their English scores will be, and whether male and female students are different in their interest in English. In this way, in the process of English teaching, attribution theory can be used to combine students' reality and their own experience to guide and train students in attribution so that they can form correct attributions. At the same time, this paper has a certain guiding role for workers engaged in English education for middle school students. It can help them understand the attribution tendency of middle school students in the process of English learning and give middle school students correct attribution guidance and training, thus improving teachers’ English teaching performance.","Lin, Lin",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495342,2022,6

Over the last decade, a rather large number of maturity models have been suggested for different aspects (such as type of technology or considered processes) and in relation to different industries. Usually, these models are based on a number of assumptions such as the data used for the assessment, the mathematical formulation of the model and various parameters such as weights or importance indicators. Empirical evidence for such assumptions is usually lacking. We investigate the potential of using data from assessments over time and for similar institutions for the ML of respective models. Related concepts are worked out in some details and for some types of maturity assessment models, a possible application of the concept is discussed.","Hanne, Thomas and Gachnang, Phillip and Gatziu Grivas, Stella and Kirecci, Ilyas and Schmitter, Paul",No data,10.1145/3556089.3556102,2022,5

inproceedings,Designing Children’s New Learning Partner: Collaborative Artificial Intelligence for Learning to Solve the Rubik’s Cube,"Developing the problem solving skills of children is a challenging problem that is crucial for the future of our society. Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to solve problems across a wide variety of domains, AI offers unique opportunities to develop problem solving skills using a multitude of tasks that pique the curiosity of children. To make this a reality, it is necessary to address the uninterpretable “black-box” that AI often appears to be. Towards this goal, we design a collaborative artificial intelligence algorithm that uses a human-in-the-loop approach to allow students to discover their own personalized solutions to problems. This collaborative algorithm builds on state-of-the-art AI algorithms and leverages additional interpretable structures, namely knowledge graphs and decision trees, to create a fully interpretable process that is able to explain solutions in their entirety. We describe this algorithm when applied to solving the Rubik’s cube as well as our planned user-interface and assessment methods.","Agostinelli, Forest and Mavalankar, Mihir and Khandelwal, Vedant and Tang, Hengtao and Wu, Dezhi and Berry, Barnett and Srivastava, Biplav and Sheth, Amit and Irvin, Matthew","Rubik’s cube, deep learning, explainability, reinforcement learning",10.1145/3459990.3465175,2021,5

inproceedings,Establishment and Design of English Translation Memory and Terminology Database Based on Artificial Intelligence,"In the application field of professional translation and localization market, since the quality of computer translation basically meets actual needs, most of the translation products that can be sold in the market use computer-assisted translation technology. However, due to the complexity and variability of linguistic knowledge, some people have proposed translation memory, which makes full use of the powerful functions of files and databases to improve the reliability and reuse of existing translation materials. Therefore, in some professional translation technology applications with high data and repetitiveness, the use of this type of technology can effectively eliminate the double operation of translators, avoid multiple translation results of the same word or two words, and significantly improve its work efficiency. This article is based on artificial intelligence-based English translation memory and terminology establishment and design. First of all, it uses literature research to explain the functions of English translation memory technology and English translation screening methods. After analyzing the memory and terminology, according to analyzing the results of the design of the memory bank and the design library, this article locates the granularity of the memory bank at the simple sentence level, and establishes a correspondence between the various components of a sentence based on the establishment of a simple word-sentence alignment. The English sentence similarity algorithm based on syntax and semantics can well measure the structural and semantic similarity between two English sentences, and can correctly return the most similar example sentences in a memory bank. After we obtained the most similar example sentences, we translated them according to the corresponding relationship between the sentence to be translated and the various components of the most similar example sentences.","Chen, Chen",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483146,2021,5

Radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology are some of the areas most likely to be impacted in the near future, and they have received significant attention from the broader research community. But AI techniques are now also starting to be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF), in particular for selecting which embryos to transfer to the woman. The contribution of AI to IVF is potentially significant, but must be done carefully and transparently, as the ethical issues are significant, in part because this field involves creating new people. We first give a brief introduction to IVF and review the use of AI for embryo selection. We discuss concerns with the interpretation of the reported results from scientific and practical perspectives. We then consider the broader ethical issues involved. We discuss in detail the problems that result from the use of black-box methods in this context and advocate strongly for the use of interpretable models. Importantly, there have been no published trials of clinical effectiveness, a problem in both the AI and IVF communities, and we therefore argue that clinical implementation at this point would be premature. Finally, we discuss ways for the broader AI community to become involved to ensure scientifically sound and ethically responsible development of AI in IVF.","Afnan, Michael Anis Mihdi and Rudin, Cynthia and Conitzer, Vincent and Savulescu, Julian and Mishra, Abhishek and Liu, Yanhe and Afnan, Masoud","AI, ethics, randomised controlled trials, artificial intelligence, RCT, interpretable, embryo selection, machine learning, in vitro fertilization, black-box, IVF",10.1145/3461702.3462589,2021,11

inproceedings,Analysis on the Application of Artificial Intelligence in the Global Value Chain Upgrade of Manufacturing Enterprises,"Since the reform and opening up, Chinese manufacturing enterprises have actively participated in the global value chain division of labor, and their international competitiveness has been continuously strengthened. However, due to the lack of core technologies and market channels, manufacturing enterprises are still at the low end of the global value chain. Artificial intelligence can be deeply integrated with manufacturing enterprises by combining with Internet big data technology. It can promote the global value chain upgrade of Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Based on this background, this paper first analyzes the reasons for the low-end locking of the value chain of Chinese manufacturing enterprises, which are due to the locking of comparative advantage, foreign technology and brand market. Then, this paper combs the theoretical mechanism of artificial intelligence promoting the upgrading of global value chain of manufacturing enterprises. Artificial intelligence can upgrade the global value chain by reducing the production cost of manufacturing enterprises, improving the effect of technological innovation and the efficiency of information circulation. Finally, this paper sorts out the concrete measures of applying artificial intelligence technology to manufacturing enterprises in China, and emphasizes the importance of artificial intelligence for upgrading the global value chain of manufacturing enterprises [1].","Lin, Rui",No data,10.1145/3495018.3495408,2022,5

Inspired by the ant colony's foraging behavior of finding the shortest path, this paper proposes a simulated evolutionary algorithm artificial ant colony algorithm, which simulates the behavior of ant colony in nature. Ant colony algorithm has been concerned by many experts and scholars, and is being studied by more and more experts and scholars. The algorithm is continuously improved, and the application scope is more and more extensive. It is a bionic optimization algorithm with good development prospects. This paper mainly introduces the basic principle and basic model of ant colony algorithm. Finally, the improvement strategy of ant colony algorithm and the research and design of artificial intelligence training platform are discussed.","Li, Fen",No data,10.1145/3510858.3511408,2022,4

inproceedings,A Meta-Analysis of the Utility of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Human-AI Decision-Making,"Research in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision-making is experiencing tremendous growth with a constantly rising number of studies evaluating the effect of AI with and without techniques from the field of explainable AI (XAI) on human decision-making performance. However, as tasks and experimental setups vary due to different objectives, some studies report improved user decision-making performance through XAI, while others report only negligible effects. Therefore, in this article, we present an initial synthesis of existing research on XAI studies using a statistical meta-analysis to derive implications across existing research. We observe a statistically positive impact of XAI on users' performance. Additionally, the first results indicate that human-AI decision-making tends to yield better task performance on text data. However, we find no effect of explanations on users' performance compared to sole AI predictions. Our initial synthesis gives rise to future research investigating the underlying causes and contributes to further developing algorithms that effectively benefit human decision-makers by providing meaningful explanations.","Schemmer, Max and Hemmer, Patrick and Nitsche, Maximilian and K\""{u}hl, Niklas and V\""{o}ssing, Michael","empirical studies, meta-analysis, decision-making, explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3514094.3534128,2022,10
inproceedings,Analysis of the Expansion of the Panama Canal Using Simulation Modeling and Artificial Intelligence,"This paper presents preliminary analysis of the Panama Canal Expansion from the viewpoint of salinity in the Gatun Lake and the utilization of neural networks. This analysis utilized simulation modeling and artificial intelligence. We have built several discrete and system dynamics simulation models of the current Panama Canal operations and the future expansion which have been validated with historical and projected data and Turing/expert validation by engineers of the Panama Canal Authority. The simulation models have been exercised in order to generate enough information about the future expansion. This information has been used to develop neural networks that have the capability to indicate the volume of the Gatun Lake and its respective salinity taking into consideration lockages, spillovers, hydropower generation, fresh water supply volumes, and environmental factors such as precipitation, tides, and evaporation. Support vector machines were used to build time series regression models of the evaporation of Gatun Lake.","Rabelo, Luis and Cruz, Liliana and Bhide, Sayli and Joledo, Oloruntomi and Pastrana, John and Xanthopoulos, Petros",No data,No data,2014,12

inproceedings,A Survey of Application of Artificial Intelligence Method in Text Emotion Analysis,"Human emotion analysis is a very extensive research field, which can be realized by a variety of applications. To engage in any project related to emotion detection, you must collect available models, data sets, and performance statistics related to it. The purpose of this review analysis is to integrate a unique and advanced set of methods proposed and/or implemented by everyone in the field. The research work of this paper mainly focuses on two aspects of classification, one is the classification based on research objects, the other is the classification based on research methods. The research object is mainly the difference between short text and normal text. The research methods mainly focus on machine learning, such as deep belief networks (DBN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). It can be seen from the comparison results that depth learning training is the best at a specific number of layers. If the number of layers is too many or too few, it will lead to insufficient accuracy or a waste of training time.

inproceedings,Local Wisdom-Based Scientific Writing Skills in Indonesian Language General Course in Higher Education,"Scientific writing is one of the most difficult linguistic abilities to master. Many individuals find it difficult to master writing skills. This study aims to facilitate students in writing scientific papers. The ability to write scientific papers is one of the skills that every student should develop since it will help them complete their final assignment. As a result, a lecturer should produce scholars with exceptional academic knowledge as well as powerful and clever personalities. This is a preliminary study of the current situation. In the learning process of the Indonesian Language general course, a qualitative method was employed to enhance students' scientific writing skills. The research data were the students’ writing, which includes rational and empirical data. It can be solved by combining learning with local wisdom in scientific paper writing to encourage students to develop their scientific writing skills and understanding of text structures precisely. This study also aims to enhance scientific writing skills by incorporating students in independent research as part of a lesson plan. Based on the findings, this method has proven to be effective in improving students' scientific writing skills, so it needs to continue to be developed in the general course of Indonesian Language learning and is expected to be the right alternative for the lecturers to develop professional skills.","Suprihatin, Dewi and Winarni, Retno and Saddhono, Kundharu and Eko Wardani, Nugraheni",No data,10.1145/3516875.3516895,2022,5
inproceedings,Towards Smarter Public Budgeting? Understanding the Potential of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Support Decision Making in Government,"The use of artificial intelligence in government and its implications to society have generated widespread interest from research and practice communities. However, the analysis of artificial intelligence techniques as a tool to support government decision-making in specific functions is still scarce. For instance, public budgeting could be considered one of the most important internal functions of government and, therefore, it is necessary to understand how artificial intelligence could impact this function. This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence techniques to classify public budgeting allocations to different programs and policies. In order to achieve this, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are applied to budget data from the Mexican federal government. Among other specific actions, the results suggest that government decision makers should consider fostering investments in social and economic development, as well as increasing the budget in non-programmable expenses in order to activate the economy. Based on the results of this study, we argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques in government, as a tool for data analysis, has the potential to support better decision-making in government. In our view, artificial intelligence should not be necessarily used to make the final decisions automatically, but to provide ideas and identify potential opportunities and different scenarios that government leaders can then assess and incorporate into their decision-making processes.","Valle-Cruz, David and Gil-Garcia, J.

inproceedings,"Introducing Software Development Process, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence in a CS0.5 Course Project","Our CS0.5 course is required for all students and tasked to develop and assess the system development process proficiencies of an engineering-based institutional outcome. To achieve this tasking, we created a course-wide project that simulates NASA's Mars Ingenuity helicopter using an approach that emphasized our software system development process. With this project, our first-year college students created a 2-dimensional simulation of the Ingenuity helicopter flying through the thin Martian atmosphere with the goal of maximizing the area mapped subject to flight dynamics, available battery, landing proximity, and impact constraints. Students created their Ingenuity simulator using Python in three spirals: Spiral 1 - rendering of the simulation view with some initial movement, Spiral 2 - manual flight operations via thrust and roll keyboard inputs, and Spiral 3 - full auto-pilot. The students utilized a software system development process called ""UDIT"" (pronounced, ""U Did IT"") which stands for Understand - Design - Implement - Test. The assignment document was purposefully organized based on this process. The Understand and Design steps were presented via storyboards, enumerated requirements, a recommended structure chart, pseudocode, and suggested variables. As the Understand and Design steps address higher order objectives on Bloom's Taxonomy, we strived to model effective approaches for these steps. Most of our novice programmer's efforts involved the Implementation and Test steps emphasizing a build-a-little, test-a-little strategy. Forty percent of points come from testing via test procedures that the students created. The remaining points were earned based on code correctness and quality. The course also introduced the students to Artificial Intelligence to contribute to another proficiency of the engineering institutional outcome. For this, the project introduced students to genetic algorithms. They learned how the algorithm's parameters can be configured to train a more sophisticated version of the autopilot that needed to deal with additional Ingenuity features, including altitude-dependent mapping, as well as randomness in the form of varying winds at different altitudes. Currently being used with 450 students across 22 sections, the project is being assessed by sub-score tracking across the spirals; students' self-assessments of learning, interest, and self-efficacy; and collection of instructors' experiences and perceptions on the project.","Hadfield, Steven M. and Roosma, Alexander C. and de Freitas, Adrian A. and Braun, Kimberly A. and Fulton, Steven P. and Coffman, Joel and Merritt, David T. and Sample, Kenneth R. and Wilson, Justin C. and Birrer, Bobby D.",No data,10.1145/3502717.3532135,2022,1

Despite thumbnails' omnipresence and their assumed effect on sales, they largely constitute a black box for research and practice. This work aims to fill this gap and asks, with regard to hedonic information goods: What is the role of thumbnails in the purchase process and how and why do their basic, conceptual and social features impact sales? To answer the question, we first analytically and empirically show that thumbnails play a more central role in the purchase process for hedonic information goods than for other types of goods. Next, we develop a variance model on how and why thumbnails affect sales. Using artificial intelligence imagery analysis, we test the model against evidence from sales data of 100,000 hedonic information goods from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings entail theoretical contributions to the growing field of consumers' visual information processing in e-commerce contexts and lead us to implications for managerial practice.","Cremer, Stefan and Ma, Alice Kyungran","artificial intelligence imagery analysis, visual perception, hedonic information goods, consumer choice",10.1145/3154943.3154950,2017,8

Conversational agents could influence how students anthropomorphize computer systems or develop a theory of mind. Previous research has explored how conversational agents are used and perceived by children within and outside of learning contexts. This study investigates how middle and high school students’ perceptions of Alexa change through programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops’ influence on student perceptions of Alexa’s intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness, trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the workshops. We also found strong correlations between students’ perceptions of Alexa’s friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness. We recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency, playfulness and utility when designing conversational agents for learning contexts.","Van Brummelen, Jessica and Tabunshchyk, Viktoriya and Heng, Tommy","AI education, child-agent interaction, conversational agents, pedagogical agent design, persona",10.1145/3459990.3460730,2021,9

article,"A Descriptive Analysis of Collective Intelligence Publications since 2000, and the Emerging Influence of Artificial Intelligence","Collective intelligence (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on a wide range of academic disciplines but has struggled to capitalise on cross-pollination between fields, particularly ones which do not self-identify with the collective intelligence label. Past studies have largely undertaken a qualitative and manual approach to classifying different trends in the CI literature. This method risks missing a significant proportion of publications in the field. To this end, we present the first attempt to reflect the field to itself through an automated and quantitative descriptive approach using Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to collect and analyse 39,334 CI papers. We further focus our investigation on a subset of the CI literature, at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and CI to understand how these two fields are interacting. We show that while the annual number of CI-only publications has remained steady since 2015, AI+CI research has continued to increase. Publications in the crossover of AI+CI are growing at a faster rate than CI-only papers but show less topical and disciplinary breadth. This may be having a spillover effect on the topical focus of non-AI collective intelligence research.

To effectively leverage this burgeoning CI-rich landscape, researchers need extensive benchmark data to maximize performance gains and map their workflows to appropriate architectures. This data will further assist CI administrators, NSF program officers, and CI allocation-reviewers make informed determinations on CI-resource allocations. Here, we compare the performance of two very different architectures: the commonly used Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and the new generation of Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs), by running training benchmarks of common AI/ML models. We leverage the maturity of software stacks, and the ease of migration among these platforms to learn that performance and scaling are similar for both architectures. Exploring training parameters, such as batch size, however finds that owing to memory processing structures, IPUs run efficiently with smaller batch sizes, while GPUs benefit from large batch sizes to extract sufficient parallelism in neural network training and inference. This comes with different advantages and disadvantages as discussed in this paper.As such considerations of inference latency, inherent parallelism and model accuracy will play a role in researcher selection of these architectures.

article,AIDCOV: An Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Model for Detection of COVID-19 from Chest Radiography Images,"As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow globally, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains the primary strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial as an alternative diagnostic tool. In this study, an Artificial Intelligence model for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV) is developed to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependencies among features and improves model performance while an attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. We used several publicly available datasets of both computed tomography (CT) and X-ray modalities. The main public dataset for chest X-ray images contains 475 COVID-19 samples, 3949 samples from other viral/bacterial infections, and 1583 normal samples. Our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 98.4%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.8%, a specificity of 100%, and an F1-score of 99.8% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on that dataset. Using a large dataset of CT images, our model obtained mean cross-validation accuracy and sensitivity of 98.8% and 99.4%, respectively. Additionally, our interpretable model can distinguish subtle signs of infection within each radiography image. Assuming these results hold up in larger datasets obtained from a variety of patients over the world, AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19, prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers, and highlight the areas in the lungs that show signs of COVID-related damage.","Zokaeinikoo, Maryam and Kazemian, Pooyan and Mitra, Prasenjit and Kumara, Soundar","convolutional neural networks, chest X-ray, chest CT, COVID-19, attention, deep learning, pneumonia, transfer learning, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3466690,2021,20
inproceedings,Filling the Gap between Scientific Research on Artificial Intelligence and Industry 4.0 Need,"AI improves the data acquisition and analysis typical of the 4.0 paradigm, leading to the optimization of the industrial processes through fast, lightweight and well-performing algorithms. The academic research efforts on AI have followed a trend of development of complex and resource-intensive algorithms that require cloud-centric architectures while the industrial architectures for data acquisition are in most cases distributed, fragmented and resource-constrained. Recent researches have demonstrated the need of moving toward a decentralized use of AI where data analysis algorithms are executed directly on the machine side (""on the edge""). As this is the future, it becomes evident that a new generation of AI and ML experts, able to adapt these technologies to the industrial needs and to foster their role as the key players of the 4th industrial revolution, is needed.

inproceedings,A Review of Artificial Intelligence in Government and Its Potential from a Public Policy Perspective,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend being implemented in the public sector. Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called ”algorithmic bias” of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.","Valle-Cruz, David and Alejandro Ruvalcaba-Gomez, Edgar and Sandoval-Almazan, Rodrigo and Ignacio Criado, J.","Public Policy, Government, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3325112.3325242,2019,9

inproceedings,Research on the Influencing Factors of User Trust Based on Artificial Intelligence Self Diagnosis System,"Artificial intelligence technology has gradually become an important auxiliary means for people to obtain medical consultation. However, many researches reflect users' doubts about the feedback results of AI system. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of the user-friendly intelligent self diagnosis system, using interdisciplinary research methods. Firstly, based on the psychological questionnaire and interview, this paper studies the public's cognition of the intelligent self diagnosis system, and discusses how to effectively improve the user's recognition and trust of the intelligent self diagnosis system. It is found that the credibility of the intelligent self diagnosis system can be improved by further improving the transparency of the system. For example, users can be provided with four different types of information, including system reasoning, system reliability, information source and personalized information. On the basis of interviews, 48 volunteers were invited to carry out a comparative experiment in groups to evaluate the impact of medical interpretation of intelligent self diagnosis system on patients' perception and trust under different transparency and accuracy models. We found that the improvement of system reliability information (i.e. accuracy model and confidence score) composed of accuracy model and confidence score strengthens patients' cognition of AI system and improves the user trust of the system; while the detailed display of system reasoning and logic can improve the comprehensibility of medical advice output of the system, but does not substantially improve the user trust. At the end of this paper, some suggestions are put forward to design an interpretable and reliable intelligent self diagnosis system.","Li, Weiheng and Fan, Xiangmin and Zhu, He and Wu, Jingzheng and Teng, Dongxing","artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, user trust",10.1145/3393527.3393561,2020,6

As with complicated intracardiac structural abnormalities, CHD is usually treated with surgical repair, and computed tomography (CT) is the main examination method for diagnosis of CHD and also provides anatomical information to surgeons. Currently, there exists a serious shortage of professional surgeons in developing countries. Compared with developed countries where large hospitals and cardiovascular disease centers have professional surgical teams with rich treatment experience, surgeons in developing countries and remote areas suffer from lack of professional surgical skills resulting with low surgical quality and high mortality. Recently, surgical telementoring has been popular to tackle the above problems, in which less-skilled surgeons can get real-time guidance from skilled surgeons remotely through audio and video transmission. However, there still exists difficulties in applying telementoring to CHD surgeries including high resource consumption on medical data transmission and storage, large image noise, and inconvenient and inefficient discussion between surgeons on CT. In this article, we proposed a framework with an image compression module, an image denoising module, and an image segmentation module based on CT images in CHD. We evaluated the above three modules and compared them with existing works, respectively, and the results show that our methods achieve much better performance. Furthermore, with 3D printing, VR technology, and 5G communications, our framework was successfully used in a real case study to treat a patient who needed surgical treatment.","Xie, Wen and Yao, Zeyang and Ji, Erchao and Qiu, Hailong and Chen, Zewen and Guo, Huiming and Zhuang, Jian and Jia, Qianjun and Huang, Meiping","Artificial intelligence, neural network, telementoring, computed tomography, congenital heart disease",10.1145/3457613,2021,24
article,Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Complex Systems: Taming the Complexity of Expert Models to Improve Decision Making,"Major societal and environmental challenges involve complex systems that have diverse multi-scale interacting processes. Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations. This framework is implemented in the MINT (Model INTegration) framework, and currently includes data and models to analyze the interactions between natural and human systems involving climate, water availability, agricultural production, and markets. Our work to date demonstrates the utility of AI techniques to accelerate modeling to support decision-making and uncovers several challenging directions for future work.","Gil, Yolanda and Garijo, Daniel and Khider, Deborah and Knoblock, Craig A. and Ratnakar, Varun and Osorio, Maximiliano and Vargas, Hern\'{a}n and Pham, Minh and Pujara, Jay and Shbita, Basel and Vu, Binh and Chiang, Yao-Yi and Feldman, Dan and Lin, Yijun and Song, Hayley and Kumar, Vipin and Khandelwal, Ankush and Steinbach, Michael and Tayal, Kshitij and Xu, Shaoming and Pierce, Suzanne A. and Pearson, Lissa and Hardesty-Lewis, Daniel and Deelman, Ewa and Silva, Rafael Ferreira Da and Mayani, Rajiv and Kemanian, Armen R. and Shi, Yuning and Leonard, Lorne and Peckham, Scott and Stoica, Maria and Cobourn, Kelly and Zhang, Zeya and Duffy, Christopher and Shu, Lele","regional-level decision-making, Intelligent user interfaces, integrated modeling, model metadata, remote sensing data",10.1145/3453172,2021,49

inproceedings,Performance Evaluation of Viral Infection Diagnosis Using T-Cell Receptor Sequence and Artificial Intelligence,"The adaptive immune system expresses millions of different receptors that detect and fight pathogens encountered throughout life. These receptors are encoded by unique DNA sequences that allow immune cells to express millions of different receptors. High-throughput sequencing and analyses of immune cell receptor sequences present a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological responses to infections and to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Even after the infection is eliminated, pathogen-specific immune cells and their receptor sequences are present at higher frequencies than prior to infection, and their increase in frequency prevents secondary infections. As a result of their persistence in the body, they may be useful for diagnosing infections and evaluating vaccine efficacy as a stable biomarker. However, this process requires thorough analysis of massive datasets at an accuracy beyond traditional statistical tests to diagnose infectious statuses based on sequence analyses. Here we evaluate various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to measure the performance of the identification and diagnosis of specific viral infections or vaccination statuses using the publicly available mouse (monkeypox infection and smallpox vaccination) and human (cytomegalovirus serostatus) T-cell receptor sequenced datasets. Our intensive experiments hold the potential for effective screening of disease status, including recently encountered strains like the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Kosfeld, Tim and McMillan, Jonathan and DiPaolo, Richard J. and Hou, Jie and Ahn, Tae-Hyuk","diagnosis, deep learning, T-cell receptor sequencing, vaccination, machine learning, infectious disease",10.1145/3388440.3412420,2020,10
inproceedings,Algorithm Optimization Model of Trading Strategy Based on CEEMDAN-SE-LSTM and Artificial Intelligence,"The key challenges of the financial industry are the volatility and complexity of the stock market, so how to make optimal trading strategy to maximize the total profit in all market conditions has become an important issue to the professional researchers and investors. This paper describes a hybrid stock trading strategy model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm and sample entropy (SE), combined with LSTM, are used to construct the integrated prediction model, which has dramatically improved the forecast precision. On the premise of accurate prediction, the extreme value theory (EVT) is introduced to improve the predictive ability of dynamic value at risk (VaR), which can manage the risk of portfolio. To forecast stock trends, the approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to assign weights to related factors. The final trading decisions are made by establishing trading signals and scoring models. Based on models above, the integrated trading strategy model is constructed as an automated trading decision tool. Taking Gold and Crude oil as examples, the profit results are proved to be decent through trading simulations.","Zhang, Jingwen and Fan, Lei and Gu, Kaijie",No data,10.1145/3558819.3565218,2022,7

This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDGs related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics. In this paper, we present the SDG Data Catalog, a global open-source database indexing SDG-related datasets, associated metadata, and research networks. We describe the construction of this catalog, which relies on state-of-the-art natural language processing models with human supervision. The catalog breaks down data silos and helps sustainability researchers navigate the data sea to initiate effective collaborations.","Spezzatti, Andy and Kheradmand, Elham and Gupta, Kartik and Peras, Marie and Zaminpeyma, Roxaneh","Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Understanding, Open Data, Sustainable Development",10.1145/3530190.3534829,2022,6

Meanwhile, a lot of experimental cases show that people can finish 2 tasks at the same time if one is familiar with one task or by shifting the thinking quickly, thus ""multitasking"" is achieved. And intelligent interaction based on how the attention distribute has become one of the current development trends. According to 3 types of interactions based on the progressive decreasing of attention requirement, we provide a standardized definition to the interaction design, and extract the typical proposals. Attention is one factor when a user is thinking his/her preferred interaction. It is proved that, compared with the traditional ""undivided attention"", ""multitasking"" is more flexibility in dealing with problems. It is an essential thinking ability evolved for human to adapt to the development of science and technology and improve the social productivity.","Xuejiao, He","Distributive capacity, Attention, Intelligent interaction, Artificial intelligence",10.1145/3366194.3366300,2019,4

Moreover, the recognition of human emotions in interactive computer-based learning applications has also been considered important although it had been overlooked for many years in the past. In view of these, dynamic personalisation and a variety of artificial intelligence techniques offer new perspectives, insights and realistic results in rendering computer-based learning more human-like and engaging than it has ever been before. This talk will present and discuss research challenges and effective approaches towards a new era of personalisation and human-like behaviour of computer-based learning software. I will review the research advancements on this topic that have been achieved in the software engineering lab of our department. In particular, the talk will focus on the automatic analysis of computer observations in computer-based learning that are collected, taking input from at least three modalities of interaction, namely the keyboard, camera and microphone in conjunction with contextual information and are then used to draw inferences about the users' cognitive status, reasoning, social classmate behaviour, preferences and emotions. In return, the tutoring content and the user interface is automatically adapted accordingly to address the individual user's needs by making appropriate recommendations and presenting adaptive guidance. Contextual information differs depending on the kind of computer- based learning applications. As such, a diversity of paradigms of fully developed and evaluated computer-based learning systems, in our lab, will be presented and discussed to exemplify the above research in the context of virtual reality educational games, social network learning, mobile learning and multi-modal stand-alone learning, based on the combination of cognitive theories about human reasoning and emotions, machine learning algorithms, decision making theories and fuzzy logic.

inproceedings,The Right Tool for The Job? Assessing the Use of Artificial Intelligence for Identifying Administrative Errors,"This article explores the extent to which machine learning can be used to detect administrative errors. It concentrates on administrative errors in unemployment insurance (UI) decisions, which give rise to a public values conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. This conflict is first described and then highlighted in the history of the US UI regime. Machine learning may not only mitigate this conflict but it may also help to combat fraud and reduce the backlog of claims associated with economic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The article uses data about improper UI payments throughout the US from 2002 through 2018 to analyze the accuracy of random forests and deep learning models. We find that a random forest model using gradient descent boosting is more accurate, along several measures, than every deep learning model tested. This finding could be explained by the goodness-of-fit between the machine learning method and the available data. Alternatively, deep learning performance could be attenuated by necessary limits to publicly-accessible claims data.","Young, Matthew and Himmelreich, Johannes and Honcharov, Danylo and Soundarajan, Sucheta","AI, Administrative Errors, Public Administration, Social Policy, Unemployment Insurance",10.1145/3463677.3463714,2021,12
inproceedings,Too Bureaucratic to Flexibly Learn About AI? The Human-Centered Development of a MOOC on Artificial Intelligence in and for Public Administration,"The public sector holds enormous potential for the use of artificial intelligence, which is also recognized and supported by the government. To realize this potential, however, it is imperative that civil servants have the necessary knowledge to recognise and optimally exploit the application and utilisation possibilities of AI. Massive open online courses (MOOC) are a promising way to help civil servants gain that required knowledge. But how can such a course be designed to become accepted by this target group? In this paper, we present a human-centered development approach to develop a MOOC about AI for civil servants. Using an analysis of the target audience’s mental models, knowledge needs, and attitudes, we iteratively developed short learning units that ground the abstract AI topics in concrete case scenarios taken from the public sector. First results of an expert evaluation (expertise in adult education, public sector, and AI) look promising and further evaluations with the target group are planned.","Dhungel, Anna-Katharina and Wessel, Daniel and Zoubir, Mourad and Heine, Moreen","E-government, adult education, artificial intelligence, moocs, public sector, civil servants",10.1145/3473856.3473998,2021,5

The complexity and nonlinearity of PM10 concentration in the atmosphere are known best captured by the nonlinear model which emerges nowadays such as Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN). In order to assess the capability of MLP-NN model in predicting the PM10 concentration, a statistical or traditional model known as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was also developed as a reference model. The daily air quality data and meteorological variables from the year 2010-2014 were assembled in developing the models. The MLP-NN model with the combination of logsig and purelin activation function revealed 75.5% of the variance in data with 6.59 μg/m3 (RMSE) and 88.0% of the variance in data with 6.30 μg/m3 (RMSE), during training and testing phase, respectively. The MLP-NN model improves by 61.5% and reducing the 62.2% error as compared to the MLR model.

inproceedings,Structural Damage Detection of a Concrete Based on the Autoregressive All-Pole Model Parameters and Artificial Intelligence Techniques,"Over the past few decades, damage identification in structural components has been the crucial concern in quality assessment and load capacity rating of infrastructure, as well as in the planning of a maintenance schedule. In this regard, structural health monitoring based on efficient tools to identify the damages in early stages has been focused by researchers to prevent sudden failure in structural components, ensure the public safety and reducing the asset management costs. Therefore, the development and application of sensing technologies and data analysis using machine learning approaches to enable the automatic detection of cracks have become very important. The purpose of this research is to develop a robust method for automatic condition assessment of real-life concrete structures for the detection of relatively small cracks at early stages. A damage identification approach is proposed using the parametric modeling and machine learning approaches to analyze the sensors data. The data obtained from transducers mounted on concrete beams under static loading in laboratory. These data are used as the input parameters. The method relies only on the measured time responses. After filtering and normalization of the data, Autoregressive all-pole model parameters (Yule-Walker method) are considered as features and used as the inputs of a newly developed Self-Advising Support Vector Machine (SA-SVM) for the classification purpose in civil Engineering area. Finally, the results are compared with traditional methods to investigate the feasibility of our proposed method.

inproceedings,Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Evidence-Based Decision Making in Government: Random Forest and Deep Neural Network Classification for Predicting Harmful Algal Blooms in New York State,"Advances in artificial intelligence techniques have shown tremendous potential as a decision support tool for government agencies. However, recent studies typically highlight the combination of large-scale datasets and high-performance computing technologies, which is frequently far away from the reality of many public agencies that still heavily rely on their legacy systems and labor-intensive practices. Using that non-ideal organizational and technical infrastructure, they have to face very complex problems and propose policy solutions. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are one of such problems. HABs have increasingly become a serious environmental issue in the United States. However, the rapid and sporadic growth of algae and the current standard relying on manual sampling weaken the agencies' response. To overcome this limitation, in this study, we attempt to bridge advanced AI technologies and current government practice by examining the potential of artificial intelligence by comparing the performance of linear probability, random forest, and deep neural network algorithms in predicting HABs with manual sampling data. By integrating manually-sampled HABs data with predictors from publicly-available datasets (land use, weather, and drought), we demonstrate that random forest and deep neural network (DNN) algorithms improve the specificity of the prediction, increasing the true negative rate. Albeit not ideal, we believe that this approach can benefit public agencies that are forced to respond to HABs with limited resources for investing in improving legacy systems. Accurate prediction with limited data could still be useful for certain government decisions, even when the mechanisms of causality are not totally clear. AI techniques have the potential to improve these predictive capabilities.","Choi, Yongjin and Gil-Garcia, Ramon and Aranay, Oguz and Burke, Brian and Werthmuller, Derek","deep neural network, harmful algal blooms, random forest, artificial intelligence, evidence based policy",10.1145/3463677.3463713,2021,11

inproceedings,AIMMX: Artificial Intelligence Model Metadata Extractor,"Despite all of the power that machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) models bring to applications, much of AI development is currently a fairly ad hoc process. Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. Our platform extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models.","Tsay, Jason and Braz, Alan and Hirzel, Martin and Shinnar, Avraham and Mummert, Todd","Machine Learning, Model Catalog, Model Mining, Artificial Intelligence, Model Metadata, Metadata Extraction",10.1145/3379597.3387448,2020,12
inproceedings,Teaching Modelling Literacy: An Artificial Intelligence Approach,"In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), models are used to build and analyze complex systems. In the last decades, different modelling formalisms have been proposed for supporting software development. However, their adoption and practice strongly rely on mastering essential modelling skills to develop a complete and coherent model-based system. Moreover, it is often difficult for novice modellers to get direct and timely feedback and recommendations on their modelling strategies and decisions, particularly in large classroom settings which hinders their learning. Certainly, there is an opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to an MDE learning environment to empower the provisioning of automated and intelligent modelling advocacy. In this paper, we propose a framework called ModBud (a modelling buddy) to educate novice modellers about the art of abstraction. ModBud uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to create modelling bots with the aim of improving the modelling skills of novice modellers and assisting other practitioners, too. These bots could be used to support teaching with automatic creation or grading of models and enhance learning beyond the traditional classroom-based MDE education with timely feedback and personalized tutoring. Research challenges for the proposed framework are discussed and a research roadmap is presented.","Saini, Rijul and Mussbacher, Gunter and Guo, Jin L.

inproceedings,Public Decision Making: Connecting Artificial Intelligence and Crowds,"The recent breakthrough of artificial intelligence, as well as the wide adoption of the wisdom of the crowd, also known as collective intelligence, across sectors, has received attention and excitement across disciplines. In addition to the scientific breakthrough, recent public sector studies recognize AI's potential contributions in public services, such as big data for decision making, the development of smart cities, and social and health care. Studies have also recognized crowdsourcing's potential for service provisions, innovation, information generation, and policymaking. However, we have only a limited understanding of the connections between these two types of intelligence and adoption conditions to properly utilize them for the public sector. To understand what roles AI and crowds can play in enhancing public services and policymaking, we adopt a bibliometric analysis to identify emerging themes and interconnections between these two streams of literature. Our study provides key themes and significance for each cluster. Our first examination of AI and crowd literature regarding connection to public values, complementary in public decision making, as well as future potential for joint adoption by governments provides some implications for future considerations.","K.

inproceedings,A Career in Organized Anarchy: Building Interpersonal Relationships in Higher Education,"Interpersonal relationships are a foundational tool for accomplishing objectives in any organizational context but play an even more important role in Higher Education environments than many others. This work explores the value of relationships as a purposeful technique for achieving goals when no established process exists, issues are complex, or resources are scarce - scenarios which are all too familiar in Information Technology. A brief literature review sets the stage for gaining a better understanding of what drives various college and university environments and their organizational behavior models. Bases of Power are addressed as an academic concept related to influence tactics and their expected outcomes. Coupling an understanding of Higher Education cultural settings, power, and influence tactics we will examine how university decisions are made, and practical methods for directing those decisions towards desired outcomes within IT and throughout the campus communities we support. The value of relationships as an influence technique is established and strategies for how and when to cultivate relationships are discussed as they pertain to staff in diverse roles, from front-line support to CIO. Washington University in St. Louis is provided throughout this work as an example of an ""Organized Anarchy"" behavioral model where many semi-autonomous units exist, and actions are many times only loosely coupled to results.","House, Matthew","relationships, acm proceedings, higher education administration, influence tactics, mentoring, organizational behavior, culture",10.1145/3235715.3235733,2018,9

For students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. Since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. We interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. Our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and Social Translucence -- a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. Despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict.

inproceedings,Ns3-Ai: Fostering Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Networking Research,"Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved its momentum in various areas such as image processing and natural language processing thanks to the advances in processing speed, data acquisition and storage. Many research efforts have been exerted to apply AI to computer networking. Performance evaluation of network systems using AI techniques can be conducted using ns-3, and such studies can be facilitated if ns-3 is able to interact with the existing open-source AI frameworks. In the past year, an ns-3 extension module called ns3-gym connecting ns-3 with the OpenAI Gym toolkit has been developed, which utilizes Zero MQ sockets as an interprocess communications (IPC) mechanism. In this paper, we propose a newly designed module between ns-3 and multiple Python-based AI frameworks, namely ns3-ai, to provide efficient and high-speed data exchange between the AI engines and ns-3. This module is built based on a shared memory implementation for IPC, which can achieve an IPC transfer speed up to 100 times faster than that of ns3-gym on a benchmark example. We also present our high-level interface design to improve the abstraction between ns-3 and different AI frameworks, and provide an example use case based on a 5G NR scenario. Our evaluation results show that this ns3-ai framework offers performance advantages over ns3-gym, especially for the use cases where large amounts of data must be transferred between ns-3 and the AI framework. This ns-3 extension module may foster the performance evaluation of AI algorithms in computer networking research with much reduced development workload.","Yin, Hao and Liu, Pengyu and Liu, Keshu and Cao, Liu and Zhang, Lytianyang and Gao, Yayu and Hei, Xiaojun","network simulation, AI, ns-3",10.1145/3389400.3389404,2020,8

inproceedings,XAI4FL: Enhancing Spectrum-Based Fault Localization with Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Manually finding the program unit (e.g., class, method, or statement) responsible for a fault is tedious and time-consuming. To mitigate this problem, many fault localization techniques have been proposed. A popular family of such techniques is spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), which takes program execution traces (spectra) of failed and passed test cases as input and applies a ranking formula to compute a suspiciousness score for each program unit. However, most existing SBFL techniques fail to consider two facts: 1) not all failed test cases contribute equally to a considered fault(s), and 2) program units collaboratively contribute to the failure/pass of each test case in different ways.In this study, we propose a novel idea that first models the SBFL task as a classification problem of predicting whether a test case will fail or pass based on spectra information on program units. We subsequently apply eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to infer the local importance of each program unit to the prediction of each executed test case. Applying XAI to the failed test case, we retrieve information about which program statements within the test case that are considered the most important (i.e., have the biggest effect in making the test case failed). Such a design can automatically learn the unique contributions of failed test cases to the suspiciousness of a program unit by learning the different and collaborative contributions of program units to each test case's executed result. As far as we know, this is the first XAI-supported SBFL approach. We evaluate the new approach on the Defects4J benchmark dataset.We compare the performance of our approach against five popular SBFL techniques: DStar, Tarantula, Barinel, Ochiai, and OP. We measure their performance using the Top-K and EXAM scores. In particular, we focus on the result of the Top-1, which importance has been highlighted in automated program repair domain, where the proposed methods often assume perfect fault localization (i.e., the fault must be found at the first rank of the suspiciousness list). Our results show that our approach, named XAI4FL, has a statistically significant and substantially better performance in terms of Top-1 than the SBFL approaches. We also compare our approach with a simpler approach to get feature importance in a tree-based model (i.e., using the Mean Decrease in Impurity method). Our results show that XAI4FL statistically significantly outperforms the MDI method in Top-K and EXAM score. Our results and findings highlight that the utilization of XAI for fault localization can improve the overall results of fault localization techniques.","Widyasari, Ratnadira and Prana, Gede Artha Azriadi and Haryono, Stefanus A. and Tian, Yuan and Zachiary, Hafil Noer and Lo, David","fault localization, model-agnostic explanation technique, testing and debugging, spectrum-based fault localization, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)",10.1145/3524610.3527902,2022,12

Currently, however, computer science educators have been reluctant to teach AI to non-majors out of concern that the topic is too advanced. To fill this gap, we propose an AI and machine learning (ML) curriculum that is specifically designed for first-year students. In this paper, we describe our curriculum and show how it covers four key content areas: core concepts, implementation details, limitations, and ethical considerations. We then share our experiences teaching our new curriculum to 174 randomly-selected Freshman students. Our results show that non-computer scientists can comprehend AI/ML concepts without being overwhelmed by the subject material. Specifically, we show that students can design, code, and deploy their own intelligent agents to solve problems, and that they understand the importance and value of learning about AI in a general-education course.","de Freitas, Adrian A. and Weingart, Troy B.","machine learning, computer science education, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3408877.3432530,2021,7
inproceedings,The Placebo Effect in Digital Games: Phantom Perception of Adaptive Artificial Intelligence,"Play-testing of digital games is a crucial part of any game development process, used to gather feedback about the game and correct any existing and potential flaws with the design. However, due to the nature of human subject testing, the feedback being collected in such experiments is prone to biases. Players' expectations play a great role in dictating their gaming experience, which means the information players receive before trying a new game, as well as the knowledge they already possess, may affect their perception and experience of the game. Two studies were conducted in order to evaluate how priming players to expect a game technology can positively influence their experience. The results supported the hypothesis that even basic instructions can change players' perception of the game, and lead to a higher level of perceived immersion when knowing that the game contains an improved feature, the adaptive artificial intelligence (AI), while it is not present in the game.","Denisova, Alena and Cairns, Paul","immersion, player knowledge, player experience, adaptive artificial intelligence, biasing effects",10.1145/2793107.2793109,2015,11

However, the advent of such ""human-like"" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an ""other"" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change. It calls for a collaborative research effort from the HCI community to study and accommodate users for a future where they interact with algorithms, not just interfaces.","Oh, Changhoon and Lee, Taeyoung and Kim, Yoojung and Park, SoHyun and Kwon, Saebom and Suh, Bongwon","anthropomorphism, algorithm, algorithmic experience, alienation, artificial intelligence, technophobia",10.1145/3025453.3025539,2017,12

There is a need to form this community, as AIs are being infused as parts of cities at an increasing pace. Thus far research on AIs have been somewhat split into two differing approaches; one that is focused on the grassroots, practice-based engineering of novel AI applications; and another that assumes a large-scale, future-oriented and philosophical approach. We suggest that a third perspective, informed by disciplines that build bridges between high level concepts and empirical realities, is necessary to straddle these two.

The actors of this emergent practice are coming from contemporary art, media and digital arts. These artists have developed an original practice of AI within their creative field. In this article, we propose a qualitative study to explore the nature of this practice. We interviewed five internationally renowned artists about how AI is integrated into their work. Through a thematic analysis of the interviews, we first find that their practice relies on crafting algorithms and data as materials. We uncover how they explicitly use this material unpredictability rather than avoid it. Secondly, we highlight the politics of their practice that consist of resisting the culture of AI research, as well as its inherent power dynamics. We also highlight how their relationship with the technology is imbued with ethics and how they rethink their role with respect to the technology.

inproceedings,CS Education for the Socially-Just Worlds We Need: The Case for Justice-Centered Approaches to CS in Higher Education,"Justice-centered approaches to equitable computer science (CS) education frame CS learning as a means for advancing peace, antiracism, and social justice rather than war, empire, and corporations. However, most research in justice-centered approaches in CS education focus on K-12 learning environments. In this position paper, we review justice-centered approaches to CS education, problematize the lack of justice-centered approaches to CS in higher education in particular, and describe a justice-centered approach for undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms. Our approach emphasizes three components: (1) ethics: critiques the sociopolitical values of data structure and algorithm design as well as the underlying logics of dominant computing culture; (2) identity: draws on culturally responsive-sustaining pedagogies to emphasize student identity as rooted in resistance to the dominant computing culture; and (3) political vision: ensures the rightful presence of political struggles by reauthoring rights to frame CS learning as a force for social justice. Through a case study of this Critical Comparative Data Structures and Algorithms pedagogy, we argue that justice-centered approaches to higher CS education can help all computing students not only learn about the ethical implications of nominally technical concepts, but also develop greater respect for diverse epistemologies, cultures, and experiences surrounding computing that are essential to creating the socially-just worlds we need.","Lin, Kevin","identity, data structures, culturally responsive pedagogy, political vision, critical pedagogy, cultural competence, ethics, social justice",10.1145/3478431.3499291,2022,7

By recontextualising neural computation, the work creates critical distance with which to examine the philosophical and cultural assumptions embedded in our conception of AI.","Browne, Kieran and Swift, Ben","ritual, neural networks, s\'{e}ance, performance art, defamiliarisation",10.1145/3170427.3188404,2018,9
inproceedings,Regulating for 'Normal AI Accidents': Operational Lessons for the Responsible Governance of Artificial Intelligence Deployment,"New technologies, particularly those which are deployed rapidly across sectors, or which have to operate in competitive conditions, can disrupt previously stable technology governance regimes. This leads to a precarious need to balance caution against performance while exploring the resulting 'safe operating space'. This paper will argue that Artificial Intelligence is one such critical technology, the responsible deployment of which is likely to prove especially complex, because even narrow AI applications often involve networked (tightly coupled, opaque) systems operating in complex or competitive environments. This ensures such systems are prone to 'normal accident'-type failures which can cascade rapidly, and are hard to contain or even detect in time. Legal and governance approaches to the deployment of AI will have to reckon with the specific causes and features of such 'normal accidents'. While this suggests that large-scale, cascading errors in AI systems are inevitable, an examination of the operational features that lead technologies to exhibit 'normal accidents' enables us to derive both tentative principles for precautionary policymaking, and practical recommendations for the safe(r) deployment of AI systems. This may help enhance the safety and security of these systems in the public sphere, both in the short- and in the long term.","Maas, Matthijs M.","normal accident theory, ai and law, trust and explanations in ai systems, ethical design and development of ai systems",10.1145/3278721.3278766,2018,6
inproceedings,The State of the ML-Universe: 10 Years of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning Software Development on GitHub,"In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous terms. These powerful techniques have escaped obscurity in academic communities with the recent onslaught of AI &amp; ML tools, frameworks, and libraries that make these techniques accessible to a wider audience of developers. As a result, applying AI &amp; ML to solve existing and emergent problems is an increasingly popular practice. However, little is known about this domain from the software engineering perspective. Many AI &amp; ML tools and applications are open source, hosted on platforms such as GitHub that provide rich tools for large-scale distributed software development. Despite widespread use and popularity, these repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique properties, development patterns, and trends.In this paper, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of AI &amp; ML Tool (700) and Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a characterization. While not the only platform hosting AI &amp; ML development, GitHub facilitates collecting a rich data set for each repository with high traceability between issues, commits, pull requests and users. To compare the AI &amp; ML community to the wider population of repositories, we also analyzed a set of 4,101 unrelated repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a repository. We've captured key insights of this community's 10 year history such as it's primary language (Python) and most popular repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI &amp; ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in future research.","Gonzalez, Danielle and Zimmermann, Thomas and Nagappan, Nachiappan","artificial intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, GitHub, mining software repositories, Open Source",10.1145/3379597.3387473,2020,12

Now, users can even collaborate with AI in creative activities such as art. To understand the user experience in this new user--AI collaboration, we designed a prototype, DuetDraw, an AI interface that allows users and the AI agent to draw pictures collaboratively. We conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. Thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. Our findings are as follows: (1) Users were significantly more content with DuetDraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) While users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the AI to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) Although users rated the AI relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. Based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with AI in creative works.","Oh, Changhoon and Song, Jungwoo and Choi, Jinhan and Kim, Seonghyeon and Lee, Sungwoo and Suh, Bongwon","human-ai interaction, artificial intelligence, human computer collaboration",10.1145/3173574.3174223,2018,13

Existing efforts have focused on the model fidelity, which however should not be the only concern. Due to the lack of adequate understanding and trust in the model, many accurate energy models have not been deployed in the real world. In this article, we introduce explainability and interpretability into the building energy model. We first use partial dependence plots to explain and quantify the importance of features at a fine-grained level and reveal different importance change patterns with different feature values. We also use a surrogate-based approach to interpret the internal mechanism and decision-making process of the model. We show that the local mechanism interpretation is feasible when the surrogate is both accurate and explainable. Explanation and interpretation are visualized, to provide system users with intuitive and informative insights with multi-disciplinary discussions.

inproceedings,Accelerating Public Service Delivery in India: Application of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.","Malhotra, Charru and Anand, Rashmi",No data,10.1145/3428502.3428510,2020,8
inproceedings,A Data Mining Approach for Student Referral Service of the Guidance Center: An Input in Designing Mediation Scheme for Higher Education Institutions of the Philippines,"The academic guidance office of an educational institution holds pertinent data of all the students in the institution such as psychological examination results, students' referral records and the like. Further, the office offered orientation services, testing services, counseling and follow-up services, individual inventory services, career guidance services, research &amp; evaluation services and placement services. In this paper, a data mining approach was used to produce a trend analysis through time series and forecasted data using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) of the student referral details from one of the Higher Education Institutions in the Philippines. Student referral historical data from the second semester of school year 2016- 2017, first semester of school year 2017-2018, second semester of school year 2017-2018 and the first semester of school year 2018- 2019 was used in the study. Results showed that absenteeism, poor attendance and poor academic performance were the highest number of recorded students' referrals over the others in which poor attendance yields a decreasing pattern among the three. On the other hand, based on the forecasted data, only poor academic performance and poor attendance showed a slight increasing patterns among others. These further signify that a proper program should be in place by the school counselors in mitigating the occurrence of referrals especially on the reasons showing an increase of prediction data.","Cabrera, Joey A. and Orong, Markdy Y. and Capio, Nelpa N. and Filarca, Arnel and Neri, Eden and Clarin, Ariel R.","ARIMA, Prediction, Moving Average, Time Series, GRETL",10.1145/3378936.3378958,2020,5

inproceedings,What Do You See? Evaluation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) Interpretability through Neural Backdoors,"EXplainable AI (XAI) methods have been proposed to interpret how a deep neural network predicts inputs through model saliency explanations that highlight the input parts deemed important to arrive at a decision for a specific target. However, it remains challenging to quantify the correctness of their interpretability as current evaluation approaches either require subjective input from humans or incur high computation cost with automated evaluation. In this paper, we propose backdoor trigger patterns--hidden malicious functionalities that cause misclassification--to automate the evaluation of saliency explanations. Our key observation is that triggers provide ground truth for inputs to evaluate whether the regions identified by an XAI method are truly relevant to its output. Since backdoor triggers are the most important features that cause deliberate misclassification, a robust XAI method should reveal their presence at inference time. We introduce three complementary metrics for the systematic evaluation of explanations that an XAI method generates. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art model-free and model-specific post-hoc methods through 36 models trojaned with specifically crafted triggers using color, shape, texture, location, and size. We found six methods that use local explanation and feature relevance fail to completely highlight trigger regions, and only a model-free approach can uncover the entire trigger region.

inproceedings,InuAid Chest X-Rays AI Product: Respiratory Diseases Detection Using Artificial Intelligence to Significantly Improve Productivity and Quality of Diagnosis,"The spread of Covid-19 virus around the world has taken many lives, quarantined people and shattered many industries. Due to high transmissibility of the virus and its silent incubation period in human beings, detection of the virus plays an important role to control its spread and to plan diagnostic and preventive measures. Laboratory tests such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) take more time and hence there is a need for rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to detect the virus to prevent its spread and combat it. Today PCR tests were used for diagnosing purposes and the chest x-ray was only used as the follow up of patients, hence these studies on the chest x-rays of patients with Covid-19 pneumonia or any other disease are still limited to the literature and must be improved in the future. In this project, the goal is to build an application for healthcare workers to monitor the health of lungs using the chest x-ray images of patients. The algorithm must be very accurate because it deals with the lives of people. Here we used computer vision and deep learning techniques in this project. The focus is to classify chest x-ray images and segment the abnormal region and to get more insights on the images from the available datasets. The diagnostic accuracy is the challenging part and to increase the detection efficiency due to the limited open-source data available. The data was collected from the internet. On classification, the trained model was able to achieve 93.10% accuracy and F1 Score of 0.93 after using transfer learning technique with pneumonia images. On segmentation, the Intersection Over Union value was found to be 0.91 on the validation data.","Kumar S.

The average lifespan of a refugee camp is seventeen years after which they organically transition into new towns. This paper uses Jordan as a case study, as it has been the country hosting the largest number of refugees since 1947. Daily practices by refugees subvert the initial planned camp into organic formations suitable for their changing needs, overriding the rigid built environment which no longer serves them. Addressing SDGs number 10: Reduced Inequalities, 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and 17: Partnerships of change, this ongoing research assesses the use of segmentation algorithms as a first step in identifying morphological patterns in the built environment and understanding transient scenarios of a refugee camp's spatial organization. By understanding patterns of spatial change, the inevitable transition from temporary to permanent settlement can be guided away from “slummification” and towards creating adequate low-income housing for refugees in Jordan.","Marji, Noor and Kohout, Michal",No data,10.1145/3569219.3569363,2022,5

inproceedings,Adaptive E-Learning: Adaptation of Content According to the Continuous Evolution of the Learner During His Training,"Higher education has always been based on a traditional education system. All learners have to attend all training courses without taking into consideration human and logistical constraints. This situation leads to major problems of massification, which unfortunately subsequently lead to problems of demotivation or even abandonment of a large number of students.A solution to these problems resides in introduction of distance learning. The implementation of online courses, such as MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), and the emergence of educational platforms such as LMS (Learning Management System) or LCMS (Learning Content Management System), have made it possible to introduce the notion of e-learning into Higher education. Nevertheless, if e-learning has left the Stone Age elsewhere, it is still an emerging field in some countries as Morocco where it is far from having reached maturity. Like any new system or proposal, e-learning has its own detractors who need to be more reassured on certain aspects.In this article, we deal with some major issues related to e-learning platforms, which offer pre-established pedagogical content without really taking into account the particularity or evolution of each learner during the training path. We will therefore talk about a customised or adaptive e-learning.

inproceedings,An Elephant in the Learning Analytics Room: The Obligation to Act,"As higher education increasingly moves to online and digital learning spaces, we have access not only to greater volumes of student data, but also to increasingly fine-grained and nuanced data. A significant body of research and existing practice are used to convince key stakeholders within higher education of the potential of the collection, analysis and use of student data to positively impact on student experiences in these environments. Much of the recent focus in learning analytics is around predictive modeling and uses of artificial intelligence to both identify learners at risk, and to personalize interventions to increase the chance of success.In this paper we explore the moral and legal basis for the obligation to act on our analyses of student data. The obligation to act entails not only the protection of student privacy and the ethical collection, analysis and use of student data, but also, the effective allocation of resources to ensure appropriate and effective interventions to increase effective teaching and learning.The obligation to act is, however tempered by a number of factors, including inter and intra-departmental operational fragmentation and the constraints imposed by changing funding regimes. Increasingly higher education institutions allocate resources in areas that promise the greatest return. Choosing (not) to respond to the needs of specific student populations then raises questions regarding the scope and nature of the moral and legal obligation to act. There is also evidence that students who are at risk of failing often do not respond to institutional interventions to assist them.In this paper we build and expand on recent research by, for example, the LACE and EP4LA workshops to conceptually map the obligation to act which flows from both higher education's mandate to ensure effective and appropriate teaching and learning and its fiduciary duty to provide an ethical and enabling environment for students to achieve success. We examine how the collection and analysis of student data links to both the availability of resources and the will to act and also to the obligation to act. Further, we examine how that obligation unfolds in two open distance education providers from the perspective of a key set of stakeholders - those in immediate contact with students and their learning journeys - the tutors or adjunct faculty.","Prinsloo, Paul and Slade, Sharon","learning analytics, obligation to act ethics",10.1145/3027385.3027406,2017,10
article,Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education: Unsupervised Topic Modeling Analysis of Global AI Curricula,"The domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is not new, with discussions going back at least 40 years. Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom’s taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how.

article,AI Education Matters: A First Introduction to Modeling and Learning Using the Data Science Workflow,"Traditionally artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses are taught at the senior and graduate level in higher-education computer science curricula following the mastery learning strategy, cf. Figure 1. This makes sense, since most AI and ML models and the theory behind them require a substantial understanding of probability and statistics, as well as advanced calculus and matrix algebra. To understand Logistic Regression as a probabilistic classifier performing maximum-likelihood or maximum-a-posteriori estimation, for example, students need to understand joint and conditional probability distributions. In order to derive the back propagation algorithm to train Neural Networks students need to understand partial derivatives and inner and outer tensor products. These are just two of many examples where substantial mathematical background - typically taught at the junior level in a computer science major program - is required. With AI and ML algorithms being used more widely by enterprises across domains, as well as, in applications and services we use in our daily lives, it makes sense to raise awareness about what AI is, what it can and cannot do, and how it is used to solve problems to a broader audience. Very much in the same spirit as the ""CS for all"" idea (https://www.csforall.org), we have to extend our curricula to include introductory courses to AI and ML on the early undergraduate level (or even in high-school) to expose students to the ideas and working principles of AI technology. One way to achieve this is to introduce the principles of working with data, modeling, and learning through the data science workflow.","Neumann, Marion",No data,10.1145/3362077.3362083,2019,4

inproceedings,An Intelligent Tool for Combatting Contract Cheating Behaviour by Facilitating Scalable Student-Tutor Discussions,"With the global increase in demand for online tertiary education, teachers are facing unique challenges in scaling assessment activities and meaningful student engagement. One such aspect is contract cheating behaviours exhibited in the modern online environment --- posing a threat to the academic integrity of tertiary education. These obstacles amplify when applied to traditionally difficult domains like introductory programming education. Prior research on contract cheating identification proposes that while challenging, techniques such as developing strong teacher-student relationships, and real-time discussions may lead to instances of identifying contract cheating behaviours. The proposition, then, is to scale real-time, student-teacher discussions with large, online cohorts --- similar to those discussions which traditionally took place in the classroom.

inproceedings,Analysis of the Influence of Education APP on the Independent Learning Mode of Junior Middle School Students,"In the context of the era of artificial intelligence, mobile learning methods are increasingly popular. Through literature research, it is found that with the deepening of subject research, more and more researchers have begun to explore the impact of mobile learning methods on disciplines, teacher teaching, teacher evaluation, etc., while exploring the educational APP for students' independent learning methods. The field research of influence is scarce. With the maturity of mobile learning technology, education APP occupies the main force of the mobile application market, and students' learning styles tend to diversify. As an auxiliary tool for education and teaching, APP helps students to acquire more extracurricular learning resources, and it also influences students' independent learning methods. Therefore, this paper uses the method of comparative analysis to analyze the influence of educational APP on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and clearly concludes that education APP has a certain impact on the self-learning mode of junior high school students, and deeply analyzes its influence on junior high school students.

inproceedings,Intelligent Robot for Early Childhood Education,"The paper introduces a preschool robot with a face tracking module based on the application of artificial intelligence in early childhood education. The face recognition function based on the convolutional neural network and k-Nearest Neighbor classification method allows the early childhood robot to recognize a specified face. The two-degree-of-freedom PTZ can be automatically adjusted based on the PID (proportion-integralderivative) control to track a face. Preschool robots actively interact with young children and send their video information to parents in real-time, effectively establishing a communication bridge between the family and the campus. Because the preschool robot can track the specified face ID and send the video information directly to the parents, this avoids the wrong tracking of non-children and protects privacy to a large extent.","Dongming, Li and Wanjing, Li and Shuang, Chen and Shuying, Zhao","home-school connection, active interaction, face tracking, preschool robot, intelligent education",10.1145/3395245.3396420,2020,5

For example, businesses utilize machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence, to identify the ideal customer for targeted advertisement. Machine learning and data science scale previous manual problems to a wider customer base. With all the various applications for artificial intelligence, there is still a noticeable gap in the number of qualified job applicants who can solve some of the machine learning problems of the day. There is a movement to introduce computer science education earlier to K-12 students. One motivation behind an earlier introduction is to better prepare students to study computer science at universities and fulfill these coveted technology positions in the future.Given this motivation, there needs to be more computer science instructional activities and lesson plans to support K-12 teachers. Currently there are several new tools and curricula available for computer science. However, there is a need for beginner and K-12 accessible data science and machine learning instructional methods. These topics are advanced computer science electives but an earlier introduction can still benefit students. Interactive visual activities support high school students to learn challenging topics.

Based on the students' experiences, we analyse how they would like to listen to lectures, practicals and labs at university. The results of the analysis show that students are open to online learning for lectures, but still prefer face-to-face classes for tutorials and labs. The students' views will help to inform the way in which higher education institutions should deliver courses at the end of the pandemic period, which will also help to rationalise the way universities operate in the future in Hungary.","Kiss, Gabor","Hungary, Prefered education form, Higher education, Online education",10.1145/3545922.3545933,2022,6

inproceedings,A Contextualized Project-Based Approach for Improving Student Engagement and Learning in AI Courses,"Project MLeXAI, Machine Learning Experiences in Artificial Intelligence, is a multi-institutional project that has been funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The goal is to develop a framework for teaching core Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics with a unifying theme of machine learning. The objectives are to enhance student learning experiences in the AI course by implementing a unifying theme of machine learning to tie together the diverse and seemingly disconnected topics in the AI course, to increase student interest and motivation to learn AI, and to introduce students to an increasingly important research area. To that end, a suite of hands-on term-long projects and associated curricular modules have been developed. Each project involves the design and implementation of a learning system which enhances a particular commonly-deployed AI application. In addition, the projects provide students with an opportunity to address not only core AI topics but also many of the issues central to computer science, including algorithmic complexity and scalability problems.Phase I of the project involved the development and testing of a prototype at three institutions: a small liberal arts college, a medium comprehensive university, and a state university. Phase II builds on phase I work and involves further development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI through a unifying theme of machine learning. The goal of phase II was to increase the number of modules and expand the implementation and testing to include a larger and more diverse set of colleges and universities.In this paper we present results of phase II assessment of the collaborative development, dissemination, and separate testing of the projects at the institutions of twenty participating faculty members.

inproceedings,Actualization of Environmental Education as an Innovative and Digital Resource for Sustainable Regional Development,"The scientific and expert community does not fully explore such a factor of sustainable regional development as actualization of environmental education. The goal of this research is to develop a list of prospective majors in the higher education system for solving current ecological challenges ensuring stable regional development. We have made a predictive assessment of the demand for prospective majors in environmental science, which is not limited to the study of the need for such personnel strictly in the labor market. A number of factors that influence people's preferences when choosing promising areas of environmental education was taken into account, such as: the industry development in the field of renewable energy; the worldwide search for a waste-free model of plastic recycling; the global scientific, technological and innovative character of regional economy development, etc. The results of this study are based on expert opinions from the environmentally-oriented scientific community and employers in the Tula region, who took part in the online survey through questionnaires. The opinion of rectors of leading universities, as well as their staff and students, on the functioning of the higher education system in the area of environmental science considering its actualization was of no less importance. The results obtained include a list of recommended majors in the field of environmental science, capable of utilizing their digital competencies and skills in solving current environmental problems; trending activities in the field of environmental development and protection, which will be in demand in the economy of the future for the sustainable development of Russian regions.","Griazev, Mikhail and Sabinina, Anna and Sycheva, Irina and Izmalkova, Svetlana and Sycheva, Natalia","Region, Environmental education, Sustainable development, Environmental problems, Innovative and digital resource, Actualization",10.1145/3444465.3444474,2021,7
inproceedings,Forecasting Learner Attrition for Student Success at a South African University,In this paper we attempt to deduce student attrition at a South African higher-education institution with the aim of identifying students who are likely to be in need of academic support so that a focus could be provided on improving their academic performance. The significance of this paper is on using computer science and information technology to address learner attrition (an African reality) and thereby impact the low university throughput and retention rates positively. We trained several machine learning classification models to deduce the student into four risk classes using only Grade 12 marks and background characteristics of the learner. We provide the following contributions: (a) the first known published trained classifier able to calculate the distribution over a students’ risk profile for a South African university focused on the conceptual framework; (b) a ranking of employed features according to their entropy to correctly classify the class variable; (c) a comparison of trained classifiers able to calculate the probability of a students’ risk profile for a South African higher-education research-intensive university; and (d) an interactive program which is able to calculate the posterior probability over the student’s risk profile so that support can be provided to them. The random forest classification model achieves the best performance with a 82% accuracy over these four risk profiles. We argue for introducing predictive tools to enhance student success and student support initiatives in Higher-Education Institutions.

College students are the main users of MOOCs, and the ability of autonomous learning is particularly important in the context of MOOCs. However, many college students still have problems in autonomous emotion, autonomous intelligence and autonomous behavior. Based on the advantages of rich MOOC resources and convenient operation, this article proposes strategies for college students to improve their learning autonomy. It includes the following three aspects. The first is to stimulate internal motivation and increase the consciousness of autonomy; the second is to use cognitive strategies to strengthen autonomous intelligence; the third is to use metacognitive strategies to monitor autonomous behavior.","Du, Wei","Learning Autonomy, College Students, MOOC",10.1145/3502434.3502481,2022,5
inproceedings,Monitoring Of Students' Soft Skills Development Within Foreign Language Learning Using Online Technologies,"Digital transformation in the world poses new challenges for workers: employers now demand employees possessing excellent professional, management, and communication skills. But modern higher education is not ready for developing such soft skills due to several problems occurred: (1) a lack of a unified typology of soft skills; (2) differences in understanding of importance of developing soft skills between students, higher education professionals, and employers; (3) unavailability and the lack of focus of higher education institutions on the development of students' soft skills; (4) the lack of valid methodologies for developing soft skills. The author used a method of content analysis of scientific literature and found out that there is relevance and necessity of improving students' soft skills and for managing this process in digital environment pedagogical monitoring can be used as it provides opportunities for well-timed control and solving occurring problems.Consequently, the aim of the research was to design a model for monitoring students' soft skills development using online technologies. The designed model includes usage of different types of monitoring and various learning and controlling teaching technologies. The experiment was carried out within foreign language learning as it can provide useful means of soft skills development. The study involved 226 first-year students of Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and was aimed at developing 3 categories of soft skills: communication, management, professional skills. Based on the content analysis, soft skills were developed using interactive teaching technologies; learning activities were uploaded into the Moodle, as well as testing was online. After utilizing the model proposed we figured out the statistical difference between results obtained during initial, intermediate, and final stages of the experiment, which proved the model's efficiency. Therefore, the model can be useful for soft skills development within foreign language learning in the system of higher education.","Medvedeva, Olesya","soft skills development, Soft skills, quality of higher education, interactive technologies, teaching technologies, foreign language learning, online technologies, pedagogical monitoring",10.1145/3446434.3446551,2021,10

In addition to the predictions, we also interpret our machine learning models with the help of state-of-the-art interpretable machine learning techniques such as permutation importance and SHAP values. The accuracy and AUC of the best-performing deep learning model are 72.4% and 0.771, respectively that slightly outperforms XGBoost, the cutting-edge benchmark model for tabular data.","Baranyi, M\'{a}t\'{e} and Nagy, Marcell and Molontay, Roland","interpretable machine learning, dropout prediction, explainable artificial intelligence, higher education, neural networks",10.1145/3368308.3415382,2020,7
inproceedings,A Framework of Online Learning and Experiment System Based on Affective Computing,"With the development of online education, the problem of emotional deficiency has gradually emerged. In recent years, the research about emotional interaction in online education, and the application of Affective Computing in online education came into being. This paper introduces the impact of Affective Computing on online education, including the use of expressions, speech, eye movement, and physiological signals, as well as text and questionnaires and other modals, or multi-modal to infer students' emotional state and learning state in the learning process, and then to realize personalized learning support. The emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface, can be applied to online education combined with Affective Computing technologies to improve the interaction between learners and the on-line learning system. This paper proposes a framework of online learning and experiment system based on Affective Computing supported by Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Brain Computer Interface. The system can provide personalized education for students and help them to carry out experiments in a virtual reality environment. The framework can reduce the impact on students in the process of data collection, so that it can obtain more real data, and the framework uses emerging technologies to provide support and reference for emotion analysis and recognition, which will make the analysis and response more timely and emotion recognition more accurate.","Zhou, Yinghui and Tao, Xiaomei","Virtual simulation experiment system, Affective Computing, emerging technologies, E-learning system, Online education",10.1145/3453187.3453405,2021,6

An Empirical Study on Term Categorization with Students","The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. This is why both psychology and subject-specific educational research deal with this topic. For computer science education, there have been no corresponding studies available so far. This paper reports on an empirical study in which around 500 German students from primary to higher education were presented with 23 IT-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) with a request to assign these to self-defined categories and to give the categories individual names.

inproceedings,Notes on Using Google Colaboratory in AI Education,"We discuss our experiences using Google Colaboratory (Colab), a hosted version of Jupyter Notebooks, in undergraduate artificial intelligence (AI) courses at two universities. Colab was designed for AI and data science researchers to share reproducible experiments and explanations of techniques, but we have also found it well suited to classroom use. The primary benefit is that it provides students computational resources sufficient to run modern AI techniques interactively, and avoids students needing to separately configure software packages and dependencies, since they can run notebooks shared by the instructor. We briefly outline two of our notebooks, for teaching deep learning with Tensorflow, and reinforcement learning with OpenAI Gym.","Nelson, Mark J. and Hoover, Amy K.","notebook interface, AI education, Google colab, Jupyter notebook",10.1145/3341525.3393997,2020,2
inproceedings,Contextual Intelligence for Unified Data Governance,"Current data governance techniques are very labor-intensive, as teams of data stewards typically rely on best practices to transform business policies into governance rules. As data plays an increasingly key role in today's data-driven enterprises, current approaches do not scale to the complexity and variety present in the data ecosystem of an enterprise as an increasing number of data requirements, use cases, applications, tools and systems come into play. We believe techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning have potential to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in data governance. In this paper, we propose a framework for 'contextual intelligence', where we argue for (1) collecting and integrating contextual metadata from variety of sources to establish a trusted unified repository of contextual data use across users and applications, and (2) applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques over this rich contextual metadata to improve discoverability, quality and compliance in governance practices. We propose an architecture that unifies governance across several systems, with a graph serving as a core repository of contextual metadata, accurately representing data usage across the enterprise and facilitating machine learning, We demonstrate how our approach can enable ML-based recommendations in support of governance best practices.","Seabolt, Ed and Kandogan, Eser and Roth, Mary","Context, Data Governance, Analytics, Graph",10.1145/3211954.3211955,2018,9

However, the promised value of AI systems in specific business contexts might not be understood, and further integrated into the development processes. We wanted to understand how software engineering processes and practices can be applied to develop AI systems in a fast-faced, business-driven manner. As the first step, we explored contextual factors of AI development and the connections between AI developments to business opportunities. We conducted 12 semi-structured interviews in seven companies in Brazil, Norway and Southeast Asia. Our investigation revealed different types of AI systems and different AI development approaches. However, it is common that business opportunities involving with AI systems are not validated and there is lack of business-driven metrics that guide the development of AI systems.

inproceedings,Towards Equity and Algorithmic Fairness in Student Grade Prediction,"Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing, achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student attributes and allow institutions to instrument their AI resources in ways that are attentive to equity and fairness.","Jiang, Weijie and Pardos, Zachary A.","grade prediction, fairness, equity, higher education",10.1145/3461702.3462623,2021,10
inproceedings,Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,"Increased enrolments in higher education, and the shift to online learning that has been escalated by the recent COVID pandemic, have made it challenging for instructors to assist their students with their learning needs. Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students.","Shabaninejad, Shiva and Khosravi, Hassan and Abdi, Solmaz and Indulska, Marta and Sadiq, Shazia","explainable learning analytics, at-risk students, learning analytics dashboards",10.1145/3491140.3528292,2022,5
inproceedings,Revealing Factors Influencing Students' Perceived Fairness: A Case with a Predictive System for Math Learning,"Educational researchers have examined artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support students' learning at a large scale. However, it has been broadly identified that AI models can suffer from algorithmic bias. A recent educational research initiative has shifted to evaluate and address algorithmic bias. Nonetheless, few studies have examined students' perceived fairness towards AI-enhanced systems in education. This study aimed to explore and understand factors that shape students' perceived fairness towards an AI system for math learning at the college level. Specifically, we have conducted a between-subjects randomized experiment with 395 participants to reveal factors that influenced participants' perceptions of fairness. The results showed that students' math anxiety levels and majors could influence participants' reported perceived fairness. In contrast, the outcome favorability of the predictive system did not affect students' perceptions of fairness. Future investigations have been planned to further understand the relationships between the designed manipulations and perceived fairness.","Li, Chenglu and Xing, Wanli","math learning, fair AI, perceived fairness, human-centered computing",10.1145/3491140.3528293,2022,4

inproceedings,Incorporating the Concepts of Fairness and Bias into an Undergraduate Computer Science Course to Promote Fair Automated Decision Systems,"Data bias and algorithmic bias are the primary contributing factors for fairness-related risks in AI-based decision-making. The concept of fairness is comparatively new and is sometimes only discussed in detail in graduate-level courses such as Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence. In addition, at the undergraduate level, a standalone course on fairness is not feasible due to the level of difficulty and the many other essential courses that need to be broached in a university's computer science curriculum. Therefore, instead of a standalone course, we have created a concise, high-level concept module on bias and fairness in automated decisions, with (1) lecture material, (2) demonstrations, and (3) assignments (i.e., exercises) on real-world datasets.","Islam, Sheikh Rabiul and Russell, Ingrid and Eberle, William and Dicheva, Darina","bias, artificial intelligence, automated decision-making, fairness",10.1145/3478432.3499043,2022,1

inproceedings,The Ethical Acceptability of Artificial Social Agents,"Artificial social agents (ASAs) are computer-based autonomous entities who interact with humans in a range of social roles, including advising, coaching, and consumer support in education and health. While there are many discussions around the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence in general, such as the AI4People Ethical Framework, the ethical ramifications that ASAs will have on human relationships as we share not only personal data but our inner most thoughts and feelings, is less explored. We conducted a study with 199 student participants exposed to Sam, an ASA which acts as a personal guide to support the student during their studies. During the interaction, Sam elicits private information, takes decisions for the user and speaks of its own study experiences. Our results indicate that (loss of) autonomy raised the strongest ethical concerns. These results confirm the importance of informed consent, transparency and accountability of ASAs and question the ethics of false memories and emotion sharing.","Vythilingam, Ravi and Richards, Deborah and Formosa, Paul","artificial social agents, ai4people framework, ethical ai",No data,2022,3

article,Investigation of the Effect of “Fog of War” in the Prediction of StarCraft Strategy Using Machine Learning,"StarCraft is a well-known real-time strategy game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in 1998. One of the characteristics of this game is “fog of war,” which refers to the fact that players cannot see their opponents' regions but only their own unit. This characteristic of the game means that the information required in order to predicting the opponent's strategy is only available through “scouting.” Although the “fog of war” is one of the most important features of the game, it has not been deeply understood in the design of artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose to investigate the effect of the “fog of war” in the prediction of opponent's strategy using machine learning for human players and artificial intelligence (AI) bots. To realize this analysis, we develop a customized replay analyzer that exports the internal game events with/without the fog of war. In the experimental results, we collect replays from various sources: human vs. human, human vs. AI bots, and AI bots vs. AI bots. This systematic analysis with “fog of war” reveals the predictability of the machine-learning algorithms on different conditions and the directions for designing new artificial intelligence for the game.","Cho, Hochul and Park, Hyunsoo and Kim, Chang-Yeun and Kim, Kyung-Joong","strategy prediction, machine learning, starcraft, Real-time strategy game, fog of war, AI bots",10.1145/2735384,2016,16

While prior work has examined pedagogies for promoting AI literacy, it has yet to examine how well technology resources support these pedagogies. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic analysis of existing online resources for AI education, investigating what learning and teaching affordances these resources have to support AI education. We used the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework to analyze a final corpus of 50 AI resources. We found that most resources support active learning, have digital or physical dependencies, do not include all the five big ideas defined by AI4K12 guidelines, and do not offer built-in support for assessment or feedback. Teaching guides are hard to find or require technical knowledge.

inproceedings,The Tool for Migrating Learning Content from Moodle to Open EdX,"Massive open online courses are a promising area of interest of higher education institutions in their competition for students. However, typically specialised open platforms are used to create such courses, while courses in higher education institutions are delivered through learning management systems. Thus, a higher education institution meets a severe challenge if it decides to offer its study courses as massive open online courses: the content hosted in the learning management system need to be transferred to another platform or re-created. The automated tools developed for this purpose could (at least partially) speed up the learning content migration process while also reducing the amount of manual work required. The paper presents the research results achieved regarding the migration of the content of Moodle courses into Open edX through the use of the cloud-based automated migration tool.

inproceedings,Automate the Peripheral Arterial Disease Prediction in Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler Study Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks,"This research work aims to automate the prediction of peripheral arterial diseases implied by the Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler (LEAD) studies by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This study is the first to use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze LEAD data for peripheral arterial disease prediction. Specifically, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the waveform into three types. The classified waveforms are used as input to the learning algorithms for disease prediction. We evaluate two traditional machine learning algorithms as well as two neural networks to predict normal and three types of artery diseases: aortoiliac disease, femoral-popliteal arterial disease, and trifurcation disease. The hierarchical neural network model (HNN) is investigated to deal with imbalanced data set. The first level of the HNN predicts the normal from diseases. The remaining two neural networks are used to predict other diseases from the rest. HNN has achieved high F1 scores: 99% on the normal case, 97% on the aortoiliac disease, and 94% on the femoral-popliteal arterial disease and 89% on the trifurcation disease through 10-fold cross-validation. The comparison shows that HNN works better than multilayer perceptron, random forests, and SVM. The overall result demonstrates that machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can be developed for peripheral arterial diseases implied by the LEAD studies while reducing the reading variability in vascular laboratories.","Ara, Lena and Luo, Xiao and Sawchuk, Alan and Rollins, Dave","neural networks, lower extremity arterial doppler, peripheral arterial disease prediction",10.1145/3307339.3342180,2019,6
inproceedings,Enhancing Student Support via the Application of a Voice User Interface System: Insights on User Experience,"Within higher education, student support is essential to enhance student learning experiences in order to improve academic success. Key struggles that Computer Science students face during their studies at university include academic writing and programming. As such, many students find these topics challenging whereby even reducing interest in the subject. With the significant growth of technology during recent years to bridge the gap of human computer interaction with the real world, Voice User Interfaces (VUI) can potentially be used as solution within student support systems. This paper investigates the application of a VUI system aimed at providing student support and derives insights on user experience. As part of this study, a VUI prototype was designed and implemented to help Computer Science students in their studies by providing academic guides notably on academic writing, referencing, and programming. Evaluation involved the application of the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to assess three constructs notably, response behavior, response quality and compensability.","Seeroo, Ouwesh and Bekaroo, Girish","User Experience, Chatbot, Voice Interaction, Student Support, Voice User Interface",10.1145/3487923.3487936,2021,6

inproceedings,High Performance Computing Education: Current Challenges and Future Directions,"High Performance Computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at extremely high speeds. Current HPC platforms can achieve calculations on the order of quadrillions of calculations per second, with quintillions on the horizon. The past three decades witnessed a vast increase in the use of HPC across different scientific, engineering, and business communities on problems such as sequencing the genome, predicting climate changes, designing modern aerodynamics, or establishing customer preferences. Although HPC has been well incorporated into science curricula such as bioinformatics, the same cannot be said for most computing programs. Computing educators are only now beginning to recognize the need for HPC Education (HPCEd). Building on earlier work, this working group explored how HPCEd can make inroads into computing education, focusing on the undergraduate level. This paper presents the background of HPC and HPCEd, identifies several of the needed core HPC competencies for students, identifies the support needed by educators for HPCEd, and explores the symbiosis between HPCEd and computing education in contemporary areas such as artificial intelligence and data science, as well as how HPCEd can be applied to benefit diverse non-computing domains such as atmospheric science, biological sciences and critical infrastructure protection.

inproceedings,Students' Performance Tracking in Distributed Open Education Using Big Data Analytics,"The field of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is advancing rapidly, and it is finding adoption in diverse areas such as Health, Commerce, Logistics, Retail and Manufacturing to name a few. Adoption of BDA techniques in the field of Higher Education is new, and it is steadily increasing. In this work, BDA techniques have been applied to track the Key Academic Performance Indicators (KAPIs) related to students at the Arab Open University (AOU) and to support the corresponding decisions in this regard. Since the AOU is a Pan Arab multi-campus distributed institution operating in 8 countries and makes extensive use of a wide range of cloud based applications to manage the students' life cycle, hence it is an ideal candidate for adoption of BDA techniques to track students' KAPIs across the AOU multiple country campuses. In order to achieve this objective, we have used IBM Watson Analytics (WA) platform to track the students' KAPIs. As a pilot project, we have focused in this work on the Information Technology and Computing (ITC) academic programme across the AOU. The Exploration and Business Intelligence BDA capabilities of WA have enabled us to analyze and track the academic KAPIs of the ITC students across AOU country campuses while the Predictive Analytics (PA) has led to identifying the dominant factors behind some of our problems such as students drop out rates. One of the most promising outcomes is the decision support dashboards such as the one related to the Student Risk Factor (SRF). By identifying At Risk Students, such dashboard can act as an ""Early Alert System"" to enable the AOU management to take corrective action to provide needed support to such students.","Hussein, Ashraf S. and Khan, Hamayun A.","academic key performance indicators, big data analytics, educational data analytics, student information systems, watson analytics",10.1145/3018896.3018975,2017,8

inproceedings,Features of Calculating Cost of Services in Educational Institutions Based on the ABC Method,"Heads of higher educational institutions seek to optimize costs and increase the effectiveness of the educational institution. In this regard, they need to know how resources are allocated and used by type of activity. Due to its simplicity, direct costing methods are used. Overhead is distributed in proportion to the number of students. Traditional methods of costing the cost of providing services do not allow taking into account all the features of the activities of educational institutions and the business processes that occur in them, which determines the relevance of the research topic. It is necessary to apply methods that allow you to compare management accounting data with the types of activities and determine at what stage the provision of educational services requires improvement. This method is Activity-based costing. The volumes of consumed resources are calculated depending on the types of activities. The purpose of the study is to justify the use of the Activity-based Costing (hereinafter - ABC) parameter when using the cost of training programs for students in higher education. The theoretical and methodological base of the research lies in the works of leading Russian and foreign scientists concerning the substantiation of methods for calculating the cost of products (works, services), accounting regulations. The research methodology is based on the systems approach used to study various calculation systems with general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, comparison, synthesis, grouping and classification. The use of a modern method of cost accounting and production costing ABC will allow higher education institution to form the cost of training students for each course more objectively, which will objectively form the price for paid services and generate more reliable performance indicators of individual departments and chairs. The results of the study can be used in state and commercial institutions of higher education in determining the cost of services for training students in various programs. The scientific novelty of the study consists in developing a model of the distribution of indirect costs by function using the ABC method to determine the cost of training programs for students in higher education institutions.","Demina, Irina and Bergal, Elena and Bezrukov, Dmitriy","method of distribution of indirect costs, ABC method, cost drivers, higher education, business processes, calculation of the cost of educational services, higher education institution",10.1145/3372177.3372178,2020,7

In light of this challenge, we create a theoretical framework that details the possible interactions in human-agent teams, emphasizing interactions through groupware, which is based on literature regarding groupware and human-agent teamwork. As artificial intelligence changes and advances, the interaction in human-agent teams will also advance, meaning interaction frameworks and groupware must adapt to these changes. We provide examples and a discussion of the frameworks ability to adapt based on advancements in relevant research areas like natural language processing and artificial general intelligence.

On the other side, educational data mining is a growing field aiming at discovering knowledge from student's data in order to thoroughly understand the learning process and take appropriate actions to improve the student's performance and the quality of the courses delivery. This paper presents a thorough analysis process performed on student's data through machine learning techniques. Experiments performed on a very large real-world dataset of students performance on all courses of a university, reveal interesting and important students profiles with clustering and surprising relationships among the courses performance with association rule mining.","Trandafili, Evis and Allko\c{c}i, Alban and Kajo, Elinda and Xhuvani, Aleksand\""{e}r","clustering, student profile, machine learning, knowledge discovery, data mining",10.1145/2371316.2371350,2012,6

inproceedings,The Functional Architecture Design and Value Orientation of the Intelligent Tutoring System from the Perspective of Man-Machine Collaboration,"In the era of ""artificial intelligence + education"", personalized education based on man-machine collaboration has emerged. Based on the differences of learners and the implementation of personalized teaching, the functional architecture design of the ""man-machine collaboration precision tutoring system"" is proposed. The system architecture is divided into three layers: data resource layer, decision processing layer and interactive promotion layer. The data resource layer provides data recording and resource support, the decision processing layer plays the role of data diagnosis and learning analysis, and the interaction promotion layer realizes flexible interaction and grouping. Through collaboration and hierarchical interaction with teachers, a more idealized system can be constructed, which can integrate evidence analysis, timely feedback and personalized support. The value orientation of the system architecture is: teachers and students and intelligent systems expand time and space in collaborative activities, teachers and intelligent systems improve teaching in collaborative optimization, and students and intelligent systems enhance themselves in collaborative interaction.","Zhao, Xi and Chen, Mei","Man-machine collaboration, Precise tutoring, Learning Analytics, Personalized system",10.1145/3510309.3510320,2022,6
inproceedings,Adaptive Learning Based on AI with Predictive Algorithms,"Learning Analytics (LA) is an analysis toolset that enables collection of students' data and context data, for the purpose of visualizing indicators of performance that allow for improvements for learning and academic success. In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest were used. These algorithms trained a model that could predict the academic success of college-level engineering students. Under an experimental model with 182 students, three instructors leading six groups of Physics II for engineering majors of the Tecnologico de Monterrey (Mexico) administered adaptive measures for one group each and not for the other of their groups (the control groups). Three forecasts were calculated considering structured academic information (numerical grades) and unstructured academic information (student ID pictures). Unstructured data from the facial photograph and numeric academic information from the first evaluation period were considered for the study. The results show a significant difference between the control and experimental groups of only one instructor, while the results of the other two instructors' control and experimental groups were consistent. One finding of this study is that, despite the prediction not being correct for each student, a general picture of the performance of the group was given. It seems that the algorithm must be trained with more data for the forecast to be more precise in the future.","Rinc\'{o}n-Flores, Elvira G. and Mena, Juanjo and L\'{o}pez-Camacho, Eunice and Olmos, Omar","adaptive learning, learning analytics, decision trees, Artificial intelligence, predictive algorithms, Educational Innovation",10.1145/3362789.3362869,2019,6
inproceedings,Developing Industry-Relevant Higher Order Thinking Skills in Computing Students,"A 2016 survey commissioned by the British Higher Education Council revealed CS graduates had one of the highest unemployment rates. Industry sources attribute this to a growing gap between employer expectations and university curriculum. This gap primarily consists of soft skills and higher-order thinking skills, which include the ability to analyse, synthesise, evaluate, critique and design. Technical job advertisements increasingly specify higher order thinking skills as entry requirements for graduates.This paper presents the results of our work studying whether formative tasks can develop higher-order thinking skills. The formative tasks consisted of quizzes covering the first four levels of the Bloom's taxonomy. The higher-order thinking skills were measured based on the static and dynamic models students created for a real world problem, as part of the final exam. Our results reveal a strong correlation exists between application and analysis level quizzes and design activities needing higher-order thinking in the exam. Students repeating the quizzes several times also had better results than others in higher-order design skills. These results suggest that practising with well-constructed quizzes especially at the higher Bloom's level exercises the cognitive channels that help improve higher-order thinking skills.","Kalra, Shekhar and Thevathayan, Charles and Hamilton, Margaret","higher order thinking skills, computer science education, intelligent tutoring systems, employability",10.1145/3341525.3387381,2020,6
inproceedings,The Intervention of Internet Technology on Students' English Learning in the Intelligent Era,"Objective: With the development of the Internet, Internet technology has had a great impact on English learning. This article explores the general expression of the performance, motivation and anxiety of students in Chinese medicine undergraduates in second language learning (SLL). performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates in China, it is to analyze the attribution and relationship of above three aspects, and propose the method of using artificial intelligence to improve students’ learning motivation, reduce learning anxiety and improve learning ability. Methods: it is to select the undergraduate students (n = 300) in Jilin Province of China as the subjects. Use the Chinese version of the Foreign Language Learning Anxiety Scale under Internet technology, the Chinese Undergraduate English Learning Motivation Questionnaire, the self-made College Students’ English learning ability evaluation scale and the English Writing Scale were used for test. Results: SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety for Chinese Medicine undergraduates are in the middle level among all undergraduates in China, and their English writing ability is lower than the middle level; Analysis of variance shows that there are significant differences in gender (p&lt;0.01) and grade (p&lt;0.05); learning ability in grade has extremely significant difference (p&lt;0.01); female 's learning ability and writing ability were significantly higher than male's (p&lt;0.01);Demographic variables were not statistically correlated with SLL performance, motivation, and anxiety (p&gt;0.05); SLL anxiety had remarkable correlation with learning motivation (p&gt;0.05); learning anxiety was statistically correlated with learning ability (p&lt;0.01); learning motivation was negative correlative with learning ability (P&lt;0.01). Regression analysis showed that learning anxiety and motivation had 44.3% and 5.8% explanatory power to English learning ability respectively. Intervention experiment results showed that Internet learning system significantly improved the performance of the experimental group (P&lt;0.01), and the performance of the experimental group in listening, reading, writing and translation was significantly higher than that of the control group (p&lt;0.01). the effectiveness of Internet learning mode had remarkable negative relationship with students’ learning anxiety (P&lt;0.01), and was significantly positive with learning motivation and learning ability (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Based on the data-driven theory, the empirical study of Internet learning system in English teaching is completed, which provides an important theoretical support for the current College English intelligent teaching in China, which also provides a strong argument for the “scaffolding function” of AI in language learning. At the same time, the research also puts forward innovative ways to improve the effect of College English teaching from the perspective of psychology: through second language learning with AI resources, the “challenging task” set by the intelligent learning system increases the intensity and difficulty of learning, thus arousing the “promoting anxiety” of second language learners, and further internalizing the external and instrumental motivation in depth in order to improve English learning ability.","Su, Zheqian and Liu, Miao and Song, Bailin and Lian, Shulin",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483015,2021,6

inproceedings,Auto-Generated Ensemble Model for Predicting Student Success,"Students' success has recently become a primary strategic objective for most intuitions of higher education. With budget cuts and ramping operational costs, universities are paying more attention to sustaining students' enrollment in their programs without compromising rigor and quality of education. Many of those universities have dedicated special units in their organizational structures to look after that objective. Traditionally, academic institutions have relied on data collected from registrar's transcripts, academic units' feedback, faculty's alert, and from interaction with students.With the proliferation of big data analytics and Machine Learning, universities are increasingly relying on students' data to predict students' performance. Many initiatives and research projects addressed the use of students' behavioral and academic data in their first academic year to classify students and predict their future performance using advanced statistical models. However, little work has been done to predict academic performance through machine learning. In this paper, we propose the use of automatic search in Machine Learning to identify the best model to predict student performance using data available prior to the start of the academic program.","Zeineddine, Hassan and Braendle, Udo and Farah, Assaad","higher education, prediction accuracy of student performance, pre-admission data, machine learning",10.1145/3368691.3368714,2019,4

However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source.In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development life-cycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process.

inproceedings,A Case Study inside Virtual Worlds: Use of Analytics for Immersive Spaces,"In this paper we describe some case studies of the use of virtual worlds in corporate training as well as Higher Education. In particular for Higher Education we describe how the Virtual World constructed using the platform Avaya Live Engage, is used as an immersive environment with pre-service teachers, who are undergoing a 1-year teacher training program, and how the data analytics collected in-world is being used to monitor and direct content development. We focus our studies on the initial hypothesis that 3D immersive environments are highly engaging and offer an experience that goes beyond the 'traditional' online education. We want to combine different analysis methods to be able to get empirical evidence showing the students' engagement with the 3D space in ways that can help us in the design of the learning experience accompanying the learners in their journey. In this paper we describe the research methods we use for the study, and give an overview of the information we can collect from the in-world analytics. We also propose how these analytics can be used for a predictive model with the intention of refocusing the virtual world experience to match learner needs.","Camilleri, Vanessa and de Freitas, Sara and Montebello, Matthew and McDonagh-Smith, Paul","higher education, data analytics, virtual worlds, pre-service teachers, corporate training",10.1145/2460296.2460341,2013,5
inproceedings,Event Processing under Uncertainty,"Big data is recognized as one of the three technology trends at the leading edge a CEO cannot afford to overlook in 2012. Big data is characterized by volume, velocity, variety and veracity (""data in doubt""). As big data applications, many of the emerging event processing applications must process events that arrive from sources such as sensors and social media, which have inherent uncertainties associated with them. Consider, for example, the possibility of incomplete data streams and streams including inaccurate data. In this tutorial we classify the different types of uncertainty found in event processing applications and discuss the implications on event representation and reasoning. An area of research in which uncertainty has been studied is Artificial Intelligence. We discuss, therefore, the main Artificial Intelligence-based event processing systems that support probabilistic reasoning. The presented approaches are illustrated using an example concerning crime detection.","Artikis, Alexander and Etzion, Opher and Feldman, Zohar and Fournier, Fabiana","uncertainty, event recognition, event processing, pattern matching, artificial intelligence",10.1145/2335484.2335488,2012,12

article,Instilling Conscience about Bias and Fairness in Automated Decisions,"Automated decision-making that impacts human interests, rights, and lives, in particular different data mining and artificial intelligence-based techniques, have become an integral part of many high-stakes applications such as sentencing and bail decisions, credit approvals, hiring, and predictive policing. However, fairness concerns, such as discrimination based on race, age, sex, etc., primarily stemming from data and algorithmic bias, is one of the major and contemporary problems associated with automated decision-making. In a traditional Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, or Machine Learning course, educators usually teach different automated decision-making techniques but largely with limited coverage on their ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and privacy. In this paper, we share our experience in building and incorporating a fairness module 1 in an existing undergraduate Data Mining course, within traditional content, and evaluate the outcome of the initiative. The module includes lectures and hands-on exercises, using state-of-the-art and open-source bias detection and mitigation software, on real-world datasets. The goal is to help instill the consciousness of fairness and bias at the very early stage of a potential future developer of automated decision-making software. The module is easily adaptable, and can be integrated into other relevant courses including introductory Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning courses.","Islam, Sheikh Rabiul and Russell, Ingrid and Eberle, William and Dicheva, Darina",No data,No data,2022,10

inproceedings,Study on Prediction of Legal Judgments Based on the CNN-BiGRU Model,"As the cases exploded, leading legal judgment prediction becomes a promising application of artificial intelligence techniques in the legal field. The goal of legal judgment prediction is to predict the judgment results based on the facts information of a case. However, the classifier of the traditional method has poor accuracy performance and cost large computational time. The commonly used deep learning models are CNN and RNN. In this paper, CNN-BiGRU was established and analyzed, which combined the good extraction ability of CNN for local feature information and RNN for long-term dependencies information of the text. Compared with the CAIL 2018 dataset, the prediction accuracy of the charges, law articles and the terms of penalty are 94.8%, 93.6%, and 73.4%, respectively. Results showed that CNN-BiGRU has a higher prediction accuracy than CNN or RNN alone and a good training efficiency over baselines.

inproceedings,An Instrument for Measuring Teachers’ Trust in AI-Based Educational Technology,"Evidence from various domains underlines the key role that human factors, and especially, trust, play in the adoption of technology by practitioners. In the case of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven learning analytics tools, the issue is even more complex due to practitioners’ AI-specific misconceptions, myths, and fears (i.e., mass unemployment and ethical concerns). In recent years, artificial intelligence has been introduced increasingly into K-12 education. However, little research has been conducted on the trust and attitudes of K-12 teachers regarding the use and adoption of AI-based Educational Technology (EdTech). The present study introduces a new instrument to measure teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech, provides evidence of its internal structure validity, and uses it to portray secondary-level school teachers’ attitudes toward AI. First, we explain the instrument items creation process based on our preliminary research and review of existing tools in other domains. Second, using Exploratory Factor Analysis we analyze the results from 132 teachers’ input. The results reveal eight factors influencing teachers’ trust in adopting AI-based EdTech: Perceived Benefits of AI-based EdTech, AI-based EdTech’s Lack of Human Characteristics, AI-based EdTech’s Perceived Lack of Transparency, Anxieties Related to Using AI-based EdTech, Self-efficacy in Using AI-based EdTech, Required Shift in Pedagogy to Adopt AI-based EdTech, Preferred Means to Increase Trust in AI-based EdTech, and AI-based EdTech vs Human Advice/Recommendation. Finally, we use the instrument to discuss 132 high-school Biology teachers’ responses to the survey items and to what extent they align with the findings from the literature in relevant domains. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, it introduces a reliable instrument to investigate the role of teachers’ trust in AI-based EdTech and the factors influencing it. Second, the findings from the teachers’ survey can guide creators of teacher professional development courses and policymakers on improving teachers’ trust in, and in turn their willingness to adopt, AI-based EdTech in K-12 education.","Nazaretsky, Tanya and Cukurova, Mutlu and Alexandron, Giora","Teachers, K-12 Education, Human Factors, Blended Learning, AI, Trust",10.1145/3506860.3506866,2022,11

Many life-impacting decisions are being partially automated, including health-care resource planning decisions, insurance and credit risk predictions, recidivism predictions, etc. Much of work appearing on this topic within the Data Mining, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence community is focused on technological aspects. Nevertheless, fairness is much wider than this as it lies at the intersection of philosophy, ethics, legislation, and practical perspectives. Therefore, to fill this gap and bring together scholars of these disciplines working on fairness, the first workshop on Bias and Fairness in AI was held online on September 18, 2020 at the ECML-PKDD 2020 conference.

When these systems begin to interact with humans, these concerns become much more complex and much more important. The field of human-AI teaming provides a relevant example of how AI ethics can have significant and continued effects on humans. This paper reviews research in ethical artificial intelligence, as well as ethical teamwork through the lens of the rapidly advancing field of human-AI teaming, resulting in a model demonstrating the requirements and outcomes of building ethical human-AI teams. The model is created to guide the prioritization of ethics in human-AI teaming by outlining the ethical teaming process, outcomes of ethical teams, and external requirements necessary to ensure ethical human-AI teams. A final discussion is presented on how the developed model will influence the implementation of AI teammates, as well as the development of policy and regulation surrounding the domain in the coming years.","Flathmann, Christopher and Schelble, Beau G. and Zhang, Rui and McNeese, Nathan J.","human-AI teamwork, human-AI ethics, artificial intelligence, AI ethics",10.1145/3461702.3462573,2021,11
inproceedings,A Preliminary Study Using Academagogy to Uncover the Problems That Block Adult Online Learner Engagement,"Personalisation plays a vital role in the engagement of adult learners in online learning environments. Historically, research has focused on applying adaptive technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, without integrating those technologies within teaching and learning approaches. Academagogy is a teaching and learning approach that allows an educator to select appropriate parts from the models pedagogy (educator-centred), andragogy (learner-centred), and heutagogy (learner-driven) for better learning outcomes. Previous studies used academagogy in face-to-face learning contexts; however, academagogy's application has been limited in online learning contexts. This paper presents our interim observations of applying academagogy to an online Information Technology course. Using mixed methods to analyse learner self-reflections, online learning analytics, learner grades, learner surveys, and learner interviews, we observed that learners progressed along the PAH continuum towards andragogy and heutagogy, with some exceptions. The exceptions were found where learners regressed on the PAH continuum when they encountered problems. The exceptions provide insights into the problem areas that block learner engagement and achievement, laying a foundation for future work in personalising the online learning experience.","Addanki, Kranthi and Holdsworth, Jason and Hardy, Dianna and Myers, Trina","Online learning, academagogy, Pedagogy-Andragogy-Heutagogy (PAH) continuum, design-based research, adult learners, personalisation",10.1145/3511861.3511872,2022,10

inproceedings,"More Than ""If Time Allows"": The Role of Ethics in AI Education","Even as public pressure mounts for technology companies to consider societal impacts of products, industries and governments in the AI race are demanding technical talent. To meet this demand, universities clamor to add technical artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) courses into computing curriculum-but how are societal and ethical considerations part of this landscape? We explore two pathways for ethics content in AI education: (1) standalone AI ethics courses, and (2) integrating ethics into technical AI courses. For both pathways, we ask: What is being taught? As we train computer scientists who will build and deploy AI tools, how are we training them to consider the consequences of their work? In this exploratory work, we qualitatively analyzed 31 standalone AI ethics classes from 22 U.S. universities and 20 AI/ML technical courses from 12 U.S. universities to understand which ethics-related topics instructors include in courses. We identify and categorize topics in AI ethics education, share notable practices, and note omissions.

inproceedings,Aligning Superhuman AI with Human Behavior: Chess as a Model System,"As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intelligent---in some cases, achieving superhuman performance---there is growing potential for humans to learn from and collaborate with algorithms. However, the ways in which AI systems approach problems are often different from the ways people do, and thus may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human performance. We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well. We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of AlphaZero trained on human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.","McIlroy-Young, Reid and Sen, Siddhartha and Kleinberg, Jon and Anderson, Ashton","human-ai collaboration, chess, action prediction",10.1145/3394486.3403219,2020,11

inproceedings,Learning Fair Representations for Recommendation: A Graph-Based Perspective,"As a key application of artificial intelligence, recommender systems are among the most pervasive computer aided systems to help users find potential items of interests. Recently, researchers paid considerable attention to fairness issues for artificial intelligence applications. Most of these approaches assumed independence of instances, and designed sophisticated models to eliminate the sensitive information to facilitate fairness. However, recommender systems differ greatly from these approaches as users and items naturally form a user-item bipartite graph, and are collaboratively correlated in the graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph based technique for ensuring fairness of any recommendation models. Here, the fairness requirements refer to not exposing sensitive feature set in the user modeling process. Specifically, given the original embeddings from any recommendation models, we learn a composition of filters that transform each user’s and each item’s original embeddings into a filtered embedding space based on the sensitive feature set. For each user, this transformation is achieved under the adversarial learning of a user-centric graph, in order to obfuscate each sensitive feature between both the filtered user embedding and the sub graph structures of this user. Finally, extensive experimental results clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model for fair recommendation.

article,Doctor's Dilemma: Evaluating an Explainable Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Brain Tumor Diagnosis,"In Medicine Deep Learning has become an essential tool to achieve outstanding diagnosis on image data. However, one critical problem is that Deep Learning comes with complicated, black-box models so it is not possible to analyze their trust level directly. So, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods are used to build additional interfaces for explaining how the model has reached the outputs by moving from the input data. Of course, that's again another competitive problem to analyze if such methods are successful according to the human view. So, this paper comes with two important research efforts: (1) to build an explainable deep learning model targeting medical image analysis, and (2) to evaluate the trust level of this model via several evaluation works including human contribution. The target problem was selected as the brain tumor classification, which is a remarkable, competitive medical image-based problem for Deep Learning. In the study, MR-based pre-processed brain images were received by the Subtractive Spatial Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (SSLW-CNN) model, which includes additional operators to reduce the complexity of classification. In order to ensure the explainable background, the model also included Class Activation Mapping (CAM). It is important to evaluate the trust level of a successful model. So, numerical success rates of the SSLW-CNN were evaluated based on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), computational time, computational overhead, and brain tumor classification accuracy. The objective of the proposed SSLW-CNN model is to obtain faster and good tumor classification with lesser time. The results illustrate that the SSLW-CNN model provides better performance of PSNR which is enhanced by 8%, classification accuracy is improved by 33%, computation time is reduced by 19%, computation overhead is decreased by 23%, and classification time is minimized by 13%, as compared to state-of-the-art works. Because the model provided good numerical results, it was then evaluated in terms of XAI perspective by including doctor-model based evaluations such as feedback CAM visualizations, usability, expert surveys, comparisons of CAM with other XAI methods, and manual diagnosis comparison. The results show that the SSLW-CNN provides good performance on brain tumor diagnosis and ensures a trustworthy solution for the doctors.","Kumar, Ambeshwar and Manikandan, Ramachandran and Kose, Utku and Gupta, Deepak and Satapathy, Suresh C.","brain tumor diagnosis, deep learning, subtractive spatial lightweight convolutional neural networks, medical imaging, Explainable artificial intelligence",10.1145/3457187,2021,26

inproceedings,A Smart Chatbot Architecture Based NLP and Machine Learning for Health Care Assistance,"A chatbot or conversational agent is a software that can communicate with a human by using natural language. One of the essential tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing is the modeling of conversation. Since the beginning of artificial intelligence, its been the hardest challenge to create a good chatbot. Although chatbots can perform many tasks, the primary function they have to play is to understand the utterances of humans and to respond to them appropriately. In the past, simple statistic methods or handwritten templates and rules were used for the constructions of chatbot architectures. With the increasing learning capabilities, end-to-end neural networks have taken the place of these models in around 2015. Especially now, the encoder-decoder recurrent model is dominant in the modeling of conversations. This architecture is taken from the neural machine translation domain, and it performed very well there. Until now, plenty of features and variations are introduced that have remarkably enhanced the conversational capabilities of chatbots.In this paper, we performed a detailed survey on recent literature. We examined many publications from the last five years, which are related to chatbots. Then we presented different related works to our subject, and the AI concepts needed to build an intelligent conversational agent based on deep learning models Finally, we presented a functional architecture that we propose to build an intelligent chatbot for health care assistance.","Ayanouz, Soufyane and Abdelhakim, Boudhir Anouar and Benhmed, Mohammed","conversational agents, Chatbots, artificial intelligence, natural language, modeling of conversations, neural machine translation",10.1145/3386723.3387897,2020,6

inproceedings,The Research and Implementation of Clothing Style Transfer Algorithm Based on CycleGAN,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought about changes in many industries, and the application of deep learning technology in apparel design has become a current research hotspot. Since human subjective consciousness plays a dominant role in design style during the design process, artificial intelligence methods can effectively avoid the problem. In this paper, we focus on the application of Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) in clothing style migration by giving an overview of CycleGAN. To address the problems exhibited by traditional generative adversarial networks in clothing style migration, this paper adds a filtering link before model training, which makes the generative adversarial network more focused and the edges more clear in the process of style migration. Through the comparison of experimental results, it is verified that the method works better in clothing style migration.","Wang, Yutong and Li, Luying","Key words: Style Transfer, Image Processing, Clothing Fashion, Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks",10.1145/3549179.3549191,2022,5
inproceedings,Using Business Intelligence to Support Strategic Sustainability Information Management,"The concept of sustainability has become an important phenomenon globally with many organisations being affected by the heightened awareness in sustainability. Organisations are more aware of the importance of promoting sustainability in all areas of operations. This is no different in the higher education sector, with a number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) playing a leading role in promoting sustainable initiatives. Effectively managing these initiatives however can be a complex task and requires data and information from multiple aspects of operations. In an HEI, operating sustainably means ensuring financial sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and educational sustainability. In order to manage sustainability effectively, HEIs require an integrated tool that can provide information on all areas of sustainability.This paper highlights the importance of effectively managing sustainability information and the challenges HEIs face in sustainability reporting. Business Intelligence (BI) is a solution to overcome the challenges and effectively managing sustainability information. However, HEIs need to overcome a number of challenges associated with BI to ensure a BI solution is correctly implemented and is effective in solving the problem of effective sustainability information management. This study focusses on the management of sustainability information in South African HEIs. The results indicate that there are many challenges to managing sustainability information in South African HEIs, including siloed data and information as well as poor sharing and communication of information. These two challenges can be overcome by a correctly implemented BI solution.","Haupt, Ross and Scholtz, Brenda and Calitz, Andre","Performance Dashboards, Business Intelligence, Sustainability",10.1145/2815782.2815795,2015,11
article,Study on Machine Translation Teaching Model Based on Translation Parallel Corpus and Exploitation for Multimedia Asian Information Processing,"Text in one language can be mechanically translated into another language using machine translation (MT). It is possible to anticipate a sequence of words, generally modeling full sentences using machine translation in a single integrated model. Human language's flexibility makes automatic translation an artificial intelligence (AI) challenge of the highest order. A single model rather than a pipeline of fine-tuned models is now the best way to attain state-of-the-art outcomes in machine translation. For example, words having numerous meanings, phrases that use more than one grammatical structure, and other grammar issues make it difficult for a machine to translate; however, many misinterpretations translate to be a breeze. A teacher's job is to assist pupils in overcoming the emotional and cognitive obstacles that stand in the way of developing effective problem-solving abilities. Students will benefit from developing problem-solving abilities since they will apply what they have learned to new circumstances. MT-AI, machine translation technology, and products have been employed in a wide range of applications, including business travel, tourism, and cross-lingual information retrieval. Text translation and phonetic translation are two types of translations that focus on the content of the source language. It is possible to create self-learning systems by injecting machine learning techniques into existing software and then observing the results of such injection. Computer software can translate a massive volume of text in a short period. It takes longer for a human translator to perform the same work as a computer program. The simulation investigation is developed based on correctness and effectiveness, demonstrating the proposed framework's reliability of 95.1%.","Gong, Yan","Human Translation, Artificial Intelligence, Student, Machine Translation",10.1145/3523282,2022,No data

inproceedings,Artificial Moral Advisors: A New Perspective from Moral Psychology,"Philosophers have recently put forward the possibility of achieving moral enhancement through artificial intelligence (e.g., Giubilini and Savulescu's version [32]), proposing various forms of ""artificial moral advisor"" (AMA) to help people make moral decisions without the drawbacks of human cognitive limitations. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on the AMA, drawing on empirical evidence from moral psychology to point out several challenges to these proposals that have been largely neglected by AI ethicists. In particular, we suggest that the AMA at its current conception is fundamentally misaligned with human moral psychology - it incorrectly assumes a static moral values framework underpinning the AMA's attunement to individual users, and people's reactions and subsequent (in)actions in response to the AMA suggestions will likely diverge substantially from expectations. As such, we note the necessity for a coherent understanding of human moral psychology in the future development of AMAs.","Liu, Yuxin and Moore, Adam and Webb, Jamie and Vallor, Shannon","ai moral enhancement, artificial moral advisor, moral psychology, normative ethics, ai ethics",10.1145/3514094.3534139,2022,10

inproceedings,The Incentive Mechanism of College Counselors Based on Intelligent Computing,"With the development of computer technology in our country, the vigorous development of higher education and the continuous deepening of higher education system reforms, intelligent computing has been integrated into the management system of universities, and significant changes have taken place in the content and functions of university management, and new changes have been proposed. As the backbone of students' ideological and political education, the team of college counselors is an important factor to ensure the continuous, healthy and rapid development of my country's higher education. The overall level and work status of the college counselor team will directly affect the effectiveness of ideological and political education and the realization of talent training goals. This article is based on the research of the university counselor incentive system based on intelligent computing. This article first uses the literature research method to analyze some problems in the incentive system of college counselors, and then proposes the necessity of reforming the incentive system for college counselors. Finally, it uses questionnaire surveys and quantitative analysis methods to analyze the work status of college counselors and how to deal with them. Research shows that the working conditions of college counselors are not very good. About 40% of counselors feel listless in their work, which may be related to the heavy workload. College counselors are dissatisfied with the incentive system, about 45% of them. It is possible that the incentive system of colleges and universities makes counselors not have great incentives for their salary and development.","Kong, Yanbo and Hu, Jianquan",No data,10.1145/3482632.3483068,2021,5
article,Recurrent Neural Networks for Edge Intelligence: A Survey,"Recurrent Neural Networks are ubiquitous and pervasive in many artificial intelligence applications such as speech recognition, predictive healthcare, creative art, and so on. Although they provide accurate superior solutions, they pose a massive challenge “training havoc.” Current expansion of IoT demands intelligent models to be deployed at the edge. This is precisely to handle increasing model sizes and complex network architectures. Design efforts to meet these for greater performance have had inverse effects on portability on edge devices with real-time constraints of memory, latency, and energy. This article provides a detailed insight into various compression techniques widely disseminated in the deep learning regime. They have become key in mapping powerful RNNs onto resource-constrained devices. While compression of RNNs is the main focus of the survey, it also highlights challenges encountered while training. The training procedure directly influences model performance and compression alongside. Recent advancements to overcome the training challenges with their strengths and drawbacks are discussed. In short, the survey covers the three-step process, namely, architecture selection, efficient training process, and suitable compression technique applicable to a resource-constrained environment. It is thus one of the comprehensive survey guides a developer can adapt for a time-series problem context and an RNN solution for the edge.","Lalapura, Varsha S. and Amudha, J. and Satheesh, Hariramn Selvamuruga","resource constrained modeling, low-rank, edge intelligence (EI), training, compression, artificial intelligence (AI), Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sparsity, sequence modeling",10.1145/3448974,2021,38

inproceedings,"Modular Experiential Learning for Secure, Safe, and Reliable AI: Curricular Initiative to Promote Education in Trustworthy AI","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied to IT systems. However, AI can be manipulated to perform undesirably, exhibit biases or abusive behaviors. When AI algorithms are parallelized on high-performance computing-based cyberinfrastructure (CI), such misbehaviors and uncertainty can multiply to obscure the root causes. Secure, safe, and reliable computing techniques can mitigate these problems. The project described in this paper aims to inform curriculum and develop materials to educate students who use AI from the outset, so that they will first become aware of the issues and secondly practical considerations will be integrated with theory in classes. Intensive, multi-faceted, modular, experiential learning units are designed to rapidly upgrade the skills of current and future CI users, so they can apply new skills to their tasks. The loosely coupled modules can be taken as standalone self-directed units or integrated into existing classes, starting with CS 1 and CS 2, which are taken by many non-CS STEM students. In a sandpit environment, learners take measured risks when guided on a journey of discovery. The primary purpose of this paper is to present key findings of the research following a 2-year pilot. A secondary purpose of the paper is to disseminate this exciting endeavor broadly, so that likeminded educators and researchers can consider participating in the project.","Fong, Alvis and Gupta, Ajay and Carr, Steve and Bhattacharjee, Shameek and Harnar, Michael","Curricular initiative, artificial intelligence trustworthiness, experiential learning, IT education",10.1145/3537674.3554756,2022,7
inproceedings,The Burden of Survival: How Doctoral Students in Computing Bridge the Chasm of Inaccessibility,"Despite efforts to support students with disabilities in higher education, few continue to pursue doctoral degrees in computing. We conducted an interview study with 12 blind and low vision, and 7 deaf and hard of hearing current and former doctoral students in computing to understand how graduate students adjust to inaccessibility and ineffective accommodations. We asked participants how they worked around inaccessibility, managed ineffective accommodations, and advocated for tools and services. Employing a lens of ableism in our analysis, we found that participants’ extra effort to address accessibility gaps gave rise to a burden of survival, which they sustained to meet expectations of graduate-level productivity. We recommend equitable solutions that acknowledge taken-for-granted workarounds and that actively address inaccessibility in the graduate school context.","Shinohara, Kristen and McQuaid, Mick and Jacobo, Nayeri","Higher Education, Computing Education Research, Ableism, Accessibility",10.1145/3411764.3445277,2021,13

The stability and accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been improved, making voice more critical in the transaction process and voice consultation of e-commerce purchases. ASR matches the learning model based on contextual cues. Eliminating unnecessary text plays an important role. We use the LSTM model and change it to contextualized custom text. In addition, to use our robot for testing, we propose a multi-task model that can jointly perform content re-scoring and has excellent responsiveness in the text of the input entity. Therefore, this article recommends using ASR technology to interpret and predict the answers to the LSTM model, allowing users to obtain expected results from actual measurements and understand which aspects are suitable for predicting specific emotions tested on this group.

inproceedings,A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Early Alzheimer’s Disease Stages Using MRI,"The continuous evolution of technology in Biomedicine has given satisfactory answers for several complex diseases. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the major neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia, belongs to this category. So far, no cure reverses or stops the biological changes that occur in the brains of patients; however, the early diagnosis and early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease is a crucial step in reducing the burden on both the patient and the caregivers. One of the predominant ways to deal with this difficulty is by integrating artificial intelligence and large-scale biomedical data. In this direction, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution data, which can be decrypted through artificial intelligence tools. In recent years, the research community has shifted to deep learning methods applied to medical images for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. In the present work, we propose a hybrid (called CNN-SVM) model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to predict the early AD stages from MRI.

inproceedings,A Classification of How MOOCs Are Used for Blended Learning,"There are many different examples of where MOOCs have been integrated into teaching and learning in a higher education context. These approaches are typically called blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) and are not intended to replace traditional learning methods but rather to enhance them. Despite increasing interest in bMOOCs there have been few attempts to date to describe with breadth the different ways in which they have been integrated with formal teaching and learning, this means that there are few guides for practitioners, and that it is difficult for the research community to compare different examples. This paper proposes a hierarchy classification of how blended MOOCs are used by presenting a systematic literature review leading to an analysis of 20 different case studies, which is then validated by an independent expert review. The resulting classification model differentiates between Supplementary and Integrated bMOOCs, where Integrated can itself be broken down into models that focus on Content, Assessment, or Interaction. Our work shows that there are at least eight different models for using bMOOCs within formal teaching and learning, although most of the existing research focuses on the Flipped Classroom model (a sub-type of the Content model). Our work therefore reveals gaps in the current understanding of bMOOCs, and will also help to contextualize and scope future research and analysis.","Alghamdi, Taghreed and Hall, Wendy and Millard, David","Blended Learning, Blended MOOCs models, Higher Education, MOOCs",10.1145/3345094.3345107,2019,7

For various reasons, the development of 3D point clouds still requires us to make more efforts to study how to improve them. With the continuous expansion of the data size, the computing performance becomes more important, and in deep learning, the convolutional layer occupies a very important position. If the performance can be improved in the convolutional layer, it will definitely bring good benefits to artificial intelligence, so this paper will propose the use of efficient reuse, depthwise separable convolution, quantization, and Winograd algorithm to accelerate the operation and reduce the weight. Finally, according to the digital integrated circuit design process based on the standard cell library, the convolution layer operation in the neural network is realized.","Liao, Kuan-Yu and Xiao, You-Sheng and Fan, Yu-Cheng","Convolutional Neural Network, Winograd, 3D Point Cloud Segmentation, Depthwise Separable Convolution",10.1145/3556223.3556233,2022,5
inproceedings,Application Case Study of Machine Learning Techniques towards a Fault Diagnosis System for a Manufacturing Plant Environment,"Fault diagnosis is a vital problem in process engineering. It is the fundamental component of anomalous event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention over recent years. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid anomalous event evolution, improve uptime and reduce efficiency loss. There is a great quantity of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modeling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the gamut, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historical process data. In this paper we present the performance of few approaches of data driven modeling/machine learning techniques on the simulated data from a distillation column.","Rao, G.

inproceedings,Game&nbsp;State Learning via Game&nbsp;Scene&nbsp;Augmentation,"Having access to accurate game state information is of utmost importance for any artificial intelligence task including game-playing, testing, player modeling, and procedural content generation. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have shown to be capable of inferring accurate game state information from the high-dimensional pixel input of game footage into compressed latent representations. Contrastive Learning is a popular SSL paradigm where the visual understanding of the game’s images comes from contrasting dissimilar and similar game states defined by simple image augmentation methods. In this study, we introduce a new game scene augmentation technique—named GameCLR—that takes advantage of the game-engine to define and synthesize specific, highly-controlled renderings of different game states, thereby, boosting contrastive learning performance. We test our GameCLR technique on images of the CARLA driving simulator environment and compare it against the popular SimCLR baseline SSL method. Our results suggest that GameCLR can infer the game’s state information from game footage more accurately compared to the baseline. Our proposed approach allows us to conduct game artificial intelligence research by directly utilizing screen pixels as input.","Trivedi, Chintan and Makantasis, Konstantinos and Liapis, Antonios and Yannakakis, Georgios N.","contrastive learning, representation learning, computer vision, game state representations, self-supervised learning",10.1145/3555858.3555902,2022,4

inproceedings,Personal Learning Environments: Looking Back and Looking Forward,"In this paper I look back at the emergence of the idea of Personal Learning Environments (PLEs) and consider why they have failed to be widely adapted. I say there was a failure to understand the role of technology in the growing commodification and managerialism in education. I point to the links between MOOCs, Open Educational Resources and Open Education and PLEs. I point to a contradiction between commodification and managerialism, with increasingly standardized curricula and credentials and the flourishing of opportunities for learning especially for adults. I say progress in researching, developing and implementing PLEs has to be viewed within the context of the wider development of educational technology and of the education and training system as a whole. Indeed, even this may be too narrow a perspective: one ambition for PLEs has been to support learning outside the formal education system and outside the classroom. I look at the growing use of Learning Analytics and Artificial Intelligence in education and consider how this might support PLEs. Finally, I refer to Neil Selwyn's idea of Ed-Tech Within Limits’ which would foreground the need to plan future education technology use with a primary aim of ‘coping with finiteness’” and “seek to re-establish technology use in education as a shared and communal activity” as a response to the climate crisis.

We added to the NLP course some general and quick accessibility topics through means such as a short guest lecture, a programming assignment and a final project that connect accessibility and AI. We gathered student feedback through a pre-survey, a post-survey and interviews with five students. The course we looked at took place synchronously in an online setting using Zoom. In this context, we observed how implementing accessibility topics remotely into the course affected students in their knowledge of accessibility and disability.","Tseng, Chia-En and Jung, Seoung Ho and Elglaly, Yasmine N. and Liu, Yudong and Ludi, Stephanie","computing education, accessibility, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3478431.3499399,2022,7
inproceedings,Social Media Content Analytics beyond the Text: A Case Study of University Branding in Instagram,"Social media is unarguably one of the wealthiest sources of information. The opinions shared on social platform have an immense influence towards the brands equity. Social media has flourished with platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat, etc. However, over the past decade, Instagram, one of the most famous photo posting social media, has dominated the youth's attention with its unique feature of being the first ever photo sharing application. Over the years, large-scale data of user activity has been collected by researchers, yet not a single research reflects the scope of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework to social media. By applying the advanced frameworks of AI, we can acquire the capability to analyze the content of social media. This content analysis enables us to be privy to numerous brands on social media, namely, retail branding, fashion branding, and, education branding, etc. In this paper, we propose a framework for education branding in social media. Our approach redefines social intelligence by helping students choose their school and provide insight on the rapid growth of the university through ranking, trending sports teams, newly introduced courses, real-time student feedback and future goals of the universities. This case study enables us to interpret social media in a complete innovative view.","Desai, Shreya and Han, Meng","Instagram, Analysis, Social media, Artificial Intelligence, Branding",10.1145/3299815.3314441,2019,8

The device consists of four parts: sulfur hexafluoride gas chamber, solid insulator, defect simulator, observation and measurement device. The defect simulator can effectively simulate free metal particle discharge, tip discharge, suspension discharge and air gap discharge. A real-type integrated defect simulator based on GIS is developed, and the partial discharge signal is tested on the simulator, the change trend of decomposed gas with time is detected. Based on this, an artificial intelligence classification method combining fuzzy ISODATA algorithm and ant colony algorithm is proposed, and the structure parameters of the two algorithms are optimized by PSO algorithm. The field application results of HV combined electrical appliances show that the proposed method is effective. The fault type diagnosis method can effectively judge the fault mode intelligently according to time series of SF6 micro-decomposition gas and typical micro-decomposition gas. This paper not only collects the original classification data from the hardware platform of the defect simulator, but also develops an artificial intelligence classification algorithm software system which is easy to be programmed. It can be directly and effectively used to diagnose and evaluate the type of insulation defect in the field practical engineering of GIS.

Course through a Knowledge-Based Chatbot Workshop,"In this paper we share interim results of an ongoing mixed method evaluative study of 43 students enrolled in an elective course “Doing Business with A.I.” at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business (LKCSB), Singapore Management University. A key component of the course design is an experiential chatbot workshop that provides non-STEM students with an opportunity to acquire basic skills to build a chatbot prototype using the ‘Dialogflow’ program. The workshop and the experiential learning activity were designed to impart students with relevant knowledge and skills such as conversation and user-centric design know how and know why that are transferrable to other situational contexts beyond the course. Based on ongoing class surveys and qualitative interviews with students, we are trying to corroborate a conceptual model developed from learning theories and models related to technology mediated learning (TML) aimed at measuring the effects of a hands-on knowledge-based chatbot workshop designed by the authors on students’ engagement and motivation as drivers of acquiring AI-related competencies such as natural language processing skills (NLP). One important didactical aspect during the design and roll-out of the chatbot workshop is that novice learners with no or very little knowledge about A.I. recognize and create the important linkage between knowledge inputs and outputs of NLP-powered conversational agents (chatbots) so that user queries are effectively addressed. The knowledge-based chatbot workshop design as described in the paper provides useful practical information for instructors interested in designing educational chatbot prototypes for effective digital teaching and learning in a business school (higher education) context that can be transferred to other organizational units beyond the university (e.g. quality customer service) in order to make learners future-ready.","Menkhoff, Thomas and Lydia Teo, Ying Qian",Chatbots • Knowledge management • Student engagement,10.1145/3546157.3546175,2022,7

These automatically generated (AG) questions can be integrated with textbook content in a courseware environment so that students can practice as they read. Scaling this learn by doing method is a valuable pursuit, as it is proven to cause better learning outcomes (i.e., the doer effect). However, it is also necessary to ensure these AG questions perform equally as well as human-authored (HA) questions. In previous studies, it was found that AG and HA questions were essentially equivalent with respect to student engagement, difficulty, and persistence.

article,Championing HCI Education to CS Undergraduates at a Grassroots Level: A Case Study in Egypt,"There is an increasing global interest in developing inclusive technologies that contribute to the social welfare of people in emerging economies. Egypt, a country facing socio-economic challenges, has been investing in an increasingly growing ICT infrastructure and human capital. The current ICT workforce is technically-oriented due to the increasing interest in global outsourcing. However, there is a need for a Computer Science (CS) workforce that is willing to engage with the bottom-of-the-pyramid users as a potential market. CS students should harness interdisciplinary skills that enable them to sympathize with users who have diverse backgrounds, perceptions, and digital literacies. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) education programs could provide the necessary skills for local CS students to fulfill this workforce gap. Like many Arab and African countries, Egyptian higher education programs and industry have been slow in recognizing the value of HCI.In this article, I address how introducing HCI education to students in an Egyptian engineering institute can benefit industry. I discuss a series of action research cycles focusing on the learning design of a student-centered introductory HCI short course that successfully sensitized students to the role of end-users in technology design. The learning design was planned to circumvent the challenging fact that HCI was underrated by CS students. Formative assessment results and my reflections, as the instructor, are discussed as well.","Lazem, Shaimaa","HCI education, emerging economies, Egypt, HCI4D, CS education, global south",No data,2019,15
inproceedings,The Role of Biased Data in Computerized Gender Discrimination,"Gender bias is prevalent in all walks of life from schools to colleges, corporate as well as government offices. This has led to the under-representation of the female gender in many professions. Most of the Artificial Intelligence-Natural Language Processing (AI-NLP) models learning from these underrepresented real world datasets amplify the bias in many cases, resulting in traditional biases being reinforced. In this paper, we have discussed how gender bias became ingrained in our society and how it results in the underrepresentation of the female gender in several fields such as education, healthcare, STEM, film industry, food industry, and sports. We shed some light on how traditional gender bias is reflected in AI-NLP systems such as automated resume screening, machine translation, text generation, etc. Future prospects of these AI-NLP applications need to include possible solutions to these existing biased AI-NLP applications, such as debiasing the word embeddings and having guidelines for more ethical and transparent standards.","Ahmed, Md.

inproceedings,Safe Reinforcement Learning in Simulated Environment of Self-Driving Laboratory,"Today we see tremendous potential in applying artificial intelligence (AI), deep reinforcement learning, and agent-based simulation to complex real-world problems. AI helps people support and automate decision-making penetrating almost all daily life aspects and research areas. One of the reasons for this potential is that AI helps us solve problems at a lower cost of resources and time. Materials research acceleration often relies upon AI using and automation of laboratory experiments, bringing significant fruitful results and advances. Self-driving laboratories include closed-loop chemistry experimentation and assist in designing new functional nanomaterials and optimizing their known parameters with AI and machine learning approaches. Due to the possibility of involving in the nanomaterials design process and some hazardous components, routine experimentation under chemists' continuous monitoring is usually required. Shifting to new intelligent technologies in self-driving laboratories with automated closed-loop experimentation requires excluding risks and accidents because of improper AI applications. This paper discusses safe deep reinforcement learning and its application in a simulated environment in self-driving laboratories experimenting with new functional materials. We proposed an approach to solving the problem of safe reinforcement learning by learning the intelligent agent to find a hidden reward and implemented that approach by constructing and using the heatmap from observation of the hidden reward neighborhood.","V.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence technologies have shown promising emotion recognition results, opening new opportunities to build systems to support ESA. However, little research has been done to understand users' perspectives on artificial-intelligence-based emotion recognition systems. We introduce Troi, an automatic emotion recognition mobile app using wearable signals. With Troi, we ran a multi-day user study with 12 users to understand user preference parameters, such as perceived accuracy, confidence, preferred emotion representations, effect of self-awareness of emotions, and real-time use cases. Further, we extend our study to evaluate the machine learning model in-the-wild to understand behaviours in-the-wild. We found that users perceived accuracy of the emotion recognition model is higher than the actual model prediction accuracy; there was no strong preference for one specific emotion representation, and users' self-awareness of emotions improved over time.","Dissanayake, Vipula and Tang, Vanessa and Elvitigala, Don Samitha and Wen, Elliott and Wu, Michelle and Nanayakkara, Suranga","automatic emotion recognition, mobile application, in-the-wild study, physiological signals",10.1145/3546738,2022,22

inproceedings,Assumed Digital Literacy Knowledge by Australian Universities: Are Students Informed?,"As disruptive technologies make an impact in the workplace, employers are demanding a broader range of skills that go beyond the capabilities that graduates have developed through their higher education studies. Further, digital literacy is increasingly being recognised as an essential skill, on a par with literacy and numeracy, to support job readiness. As a result there is increasing pressure on universities to ensure their courses prepare graduates appropriately, but is digital literacy amongst these skills? The first step to address this question is to gain an understanding of what universities' expectations are of a student's assumed digital literacy knowledge, the foundation from which graduate digital capabilities are built. The aim of this study is to investigate what information Australian universities provide to prospective students to inform them of the expectations of assumed digital literacy knowledge when entering a course. Based on a sample of 13 Australian universities it seems that minimal information is being provided to new students. This study demonstrates that there is no shared understanding of what digital literacy entails, which poses challenges for students who are expected to have an ill-defined and in some instances, unknown set of digital skills. It also challenges relationships between staff and students, as expectations and understanding of digital skills are not aligned.","Coldwell-Neilson, Jo","higher education, Digital literacy, assumed knowledge",10.1145/3013499.3013505,2017,6

inproceedings,Correlations between Automated Rhetorical Analysis and Tutors' Grades on Student Essays,"When assessing student essays, educators look for the students' ability to present and pursue well-reasoned and strong arguments. Such scholarly argumentation is often articulated by rhetorical metadiscourse. Educators will be necessarily examining metadiscourse in students' writing as signals of the intellectual moves that make their reasoning visible. Therefore students and educators could benefit from available powerful automated textual analysis that is able to detect rhetorical metadiscourse. However, there is a need to validate such technologies in higher education contexts, since they were originally developed in non-educational applications.

inproceedings,Towards an Operationalization of AI Acceptance among Pre-Service Teachers,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its popularity in many fields of our life, ranging from song recommendation to lung cancer identification. CSE can impart AI knowledge to all people (including teachers) so that they can make an informed decision about AI. Besides, AI technologies can support tailoring the education to the students’ needs or unload teachers by doing routine work for them and leaving more space for creativity. However, despite the growing potential of AI applications in education, some skepticism or even rejection can be observed. It could be especially critical for teacher education: by being a role model for pupils, teachers could multiply their attitude towards AI while transferring it to the pupils. Although AI acceptance is broadly investigated in the marketing context, there is not much prior research on AI acceptance among teachers. Besides, AI acceptance as a term is questionable due to the heterogeneity of the AI field. We highlight the research gap, propose an instrument for the data collection, and introduce the idea of the acceptance spectrum. The proposed concept is exemplified by the case study of acceptance of the AI-supported homework assessment among pre-service teachers.","Chikobava, Margarita and Romeike, Ralf","Artificial Intelligence (AI) acceptance, Computer Science Education (CSE), Artificial Intelligence (AI) education",10.1145/3481312.3481349,2021,2

inproceedings,Human Centered Explainability for Intelligent Vehicles – A User Study,"Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to an increased use of algorithm-generated user-adaptivity in everyday products. Explainable AI aims to make algorithmic decision-making more transparent to humans. As future vehicles become more intelligent and user-adaptive, explainability will play an important role ensuring that drivers understand the AI system's functionalities and outputs. However, when integrating explainability into in-vehicle features there is a lack of knowledge about user needs and requirements and how to address them. We conducted a study with 59 participants focusing on how end-users evaluate explainability in the context of user-adaptive comfort and infotainment features. Results show that explanations foster perceived understandability and transparency of the system, but that the need for explanation may vary between features. Additionally, we found that insufficiently designed explanations can decrease acceptance of the system. Our findings underline the requirement for a user-centered approach in explainable AI and indicate approaches for future research.","Graefe, Julia and Paden, Selma and Engelhardt, Doreen and Bengler, Klaus","user studies, intelligent vehicles, explainable AI, Human-AI interaction, user-adaptive",10.1145/3543174.3546846,2022,10

inproceedings,Developing an Adaptive AI Agent Using Supervised and Reinforcement Learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search in FightingICE,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are efficient algorithms for video game artificial intelligence (AI) agents, while Supervised Learning (SL) would make a video game AI agent visual-based. Combining SL and RL with MCTS has been tested in Computer Go, but this has yet to be thoroughly explored for fighting games. FightingICE, a 2D fighting game, serves as an ideal testing environment because of its complex action and observation spaces. In this paper, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Q-Learning with MCTS (DQCN with MCTS) to create three models for FightingICE and compare their performance with an MCTS agent when playing against the same set of human testers. Our best performing model achieved a 58.57% game win-rate in 70 testing games after 7 training games. Although the model did not beat the MCTS agent's performance, it demonstrates the potential of combining SL, RL, and MCTS to develop an AI agent for fighting games.","Q. Tomas, John Paul and R.

There is an urgency to this task because climate-abetted socio-economic and inter-cultural stress can trigger conflict at all scales, which exacerbates human suffering. We argue that the interdisciplinary community of scholars with expertise in multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation and artificial life modeling have a unique opportunity to collaborate and address these challenges by attempting to develop artificial societies capable of uncovering adaptive pathways that can minimize social conflict and maximize cooperation in the face of climate-abetted social and ecological change.","Shults, F.

But technologies in education go beyond the simple use of video lectures: technologies might be exploited to improve personal learning. In this paper, we focus on the dropout of studies, a global phenomenon that artificial intelligence techniques are trying to ameliorate.

inproceedings,Efficient Data Processing Method for Edge Intelligence Based on SVM,"Recently, edge intelligence is emerging. It is widely used because it allows you to make business models more efficient through edge intelligence, but there is still a lack of models to use for edge intelligence. Artificial neural networks are being used a lot because they solve the problem of overfitting, which is a disadvantage of artificial neural networks and increase the speed by improving GPU performance. However as the independent variable to be learned increases, the learning time and characteristics of the artificial neural network slow down and the size of the neural network becomes very heavier. The shortage of these artificial neural networks make it difficult to make edge intelligence for classification or prediction in real life. Manufacturing lightweight models using heavy neural networks and high-performance GPUs also presents a lot of financial problems. However, SVM based on statistical mathematics exists between machine learning. Although it is relatively inferior to artificial intelligence, it is better light and has stable performing. To do this, we propose an efficient data processing method that improves the characteristics of the SVM (the overall performance, accuracy and learning speed of the SVM) and makes it easier for the SVM to learn the data. When four types of data processing were applied, the accuracy increased by more than 0.4% for the iris data set and 2% on average for the other data sets, and the training time for all data sets was also reduced. As a result, SVMs that can process data efficiently are much lighter than artificial neural networks and have very good training times versus accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient data processing method based on SVM for edge intelligence.","Jung, Namgyu and Yoon, Junho and Mutombo, Kazadi Vially and Lee, Seungyeon and Lee, Jusuk and Choi, Chang","Multicollinearity, Data preprocessing, Edge intelligence, Variance Inflation factor, Standard Scaler, Support Vector Machine, Isolation Forest",10.1145/3440943.3444728,2021,6

inproceedings,South Korean Public Value Coproduction Towards‘AI for Humanity’: A Synergy of Sociocultural Norms and Multistakeholder Deliberation in Bridging the Design and Implementation of National AI Ethics Guidelines,"As emerging technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) pose fundamental challenges for global and domestic technological governance, the‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) comes to the fore with AI as a frontrunner, generating discussions on the ethical elements of AI amongst key stakeholder groups, such as government, academia, industry, and civil society. However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation. This paper hopes to contribute to theory-building in AI ethics and provide a point of comparison in the international stage for future research concerning AI ethics design and implementation.","Ha, You Jeen","Deliberative democracy, 4IR, Sociocultural norms, Public value, Artificial intelligence, Networked governance, AI policy, National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, South Korea, AI ethics, Multistakeholder",10.1145/3531146.3533091,2022,11

Classic supervised learning methods were applied to the extracted features and trained classifiers were evaluated on the collected data to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.","Wan, Min and Guo, Hang and Jian, Wenjuan","support vector machine, classification, alpha shape, convex hull, neural network, Computer-aided design models",10.1145/3433996.3434002,2020,5
inproceedings,The UX of Interactive Machine Learning,"Machine Learning (ML) has been a prominent area of research within Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML uses mathematical models to recognize patterns in large and complex data sets to aid decision making in different application areas, such as image and speech recognition, consumer recommendations, fraud detection and more. ML systems typically go through a training period in which the system encounters and learns about the data; further, this training often requires some degree of human intervention. Interactive machine learning (IML) refers to ML applications that depend on continuous user interaction. From an HCI perspective, how humans interact with and experience ML models in training is the main focus of this workshop proposal. In this workshop we focus on the user experience (UX) of Interactive Machine Learning, a topic with implications not only for usability but also for the long-term success of the IML systems themselves.","Ghajargar, Maliheh and Persson, Jan and Bardzell, Jeffrey and Holmberg, Lars and Tegen, Agnes","Machine Learning, Interaction Design, UX, User Experience, Artificial Intelligence",10.1145/3419249.3421236,2020,3

inproceedings,Towards a Game-Independent Model and Data-Structures in Digital Board Games: An Overview of the State-of-the-Art,"The increasing number of options of digital board games is exciting not only from an entertainment perspective but also from an academic prospect. It enables, for example, the application of modern computational techniques and algorithms for extracting and analyzing data from a variety of games - which range from classics like Chess and Go to modern board games with complex rules like Settlers of Catan and Terra Mystica. It is intuitive that different digital board games require distinct representation schemes and data structures to save, for example, the status or snapshot of a particular game at a specific moment. The choice for a representation model and data-structures is a crucial design decision that affects the selection of an algorithmic solution as well as the suitableness for artificial intelligence agents. This survey focuses on the different schemes and data structures used to represent game states, physical components, players, actions and rules for digital board games that have been reported in the academic literature. This study aims to lay the groundwork for the development of a game-independent computational framework which includes a generic game representation to facilitate and promote the application of computational techniques such as, for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning to this domain.","de Araujo, Luiz Jonata Pires and Charikova, Mariia and Sales, Juliano Efson and Smirnov, Vladislav and Thapaliya, Ananga","game states, board games, knowledge representation, data structures",10.1145/3337722.3342238,2019,8
inproceedings,"""All Rise for the AI Director"": Eliciting Possible Futures of Voice Technology through Story Completion","How might the capabilities of voice assistants several decades in the future shape human society? To anticipate the space of possible futures for voice assistants, we asked 149 participants to each complete a story based on a brief story stem set in the year 2050 in one of five different contexts: the home, doctor's office, school, workplace, and public transit. Story completion as a method elicits participants' visions of possible futures, unconstrained by their understanding of current technological capabilities, but still reflective of current sociocultural values. Through a thematic analysis, we find these stories reveal the extremes of the capabilities and concerns of today's voice assistants---and artificial intelligence---such as improving efficiency and offering instantaneous support, but also replacing human jobs, eroding human agency, and causing harm through malfunction. We conclude by discussing how these speculative visions might inform and inspire the design of voice assistants and other artificial intelligence.","Cambre, Julia and Reig, Samantha and Kravitz, Queenie and Kulkarni, Chinmay","voice assistant, speculative design, conversational user interface, story completion, cui",10.1145/3357236.3395479,2020,14

inproceedings,Vision Paper: Causal Inference for Interpretable and Robust Machine Learning in Mobility Analysis,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many areas of our lives, leading a new era of technological advancement. Particularly, the transportation sector would benefit from the progress in AI and advance the development of intelligent transportation systems. Building intelligent transportation systems requires an intricate combination of artificial intelligence and mobility analysis. The past few years have seen rapid development in transportation applications using advanced deep neural networks. However, such deep neural networks are difficult to interpret and lack robustness, which slows the deployment of these AI-powered algorithms in practice. To improve their usability, increasing research efforts have been devoted to developing interpretable and robust machine learning methods, among which the causal inference approach recently gained traction as it provides interpretable and actionable information. Moreover, most of these methods are developed for image or sequential data which do not satisfy specific requirements of mobility data analysis. This vision paper emphasizes research challenges in deep learning-based mobility analysis that require interpretability and robustness, summarizes recent developments in using causal inference for improving the interpretability and robustness of machine learning methods, and highlights opportunities in developing causally-enabled machine learning models tailored for mobility analysis. This research direction will make AI in the transportation sector more interpretable and reliable, thus contributing to safer, more efficient, and more sustainable future transportation systems.","Xin, Yanan and Tagasovska, Natasa and Perez-Cruz, Fernando and Raubal, Martin","mobility analysis, causal inference, machine learning, interpretability, robustness",10.1145/3557915.3561473,2022,4
article,Viewpoint: AI as Author – Bridging the Gap Between Machine Learning and Literary Theory,"Anticipating the rise in Artificial Intelligence’s ability to produce original works of literature, this study suggests that literariness, or that which constitutes a text as literary, is understudied in relation to text generation. From a computational perspective, literature is particularly challenging because it typically employs figurative and ambiguous language. Literary expertise would be beneficial to understanding how meaning and emotion are conveyed in this art form but is often overlooked. We propose placing experts from two dissimilar disciplines – machine learning and literary studies – in conversation to improve the quality of AI writing. Concentrating on evaluation as a vital stage in the text generation process, the study demonstrates that benefit could be derived from literary theoretical perspectives. This knowledge would improve algorithm design and enable a deeper understanding of how AI learns and generates.

inproceedings,AI + Dance: Co-Designing Culturally Sustaining Curricular Resources for AI and Ethics Education Through Artistic Computing,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems are ubiquitous across many fields ranging from medicine (e.g., tumor detection), to natural language processing (e.g., digital home assistants, auto-translate tools), and personalization (e.g., social media recommendations). The rise of these systems has also seen a rise in the ethical challenges resulting from how some of these systems are designed and implemented. Most problematic is their propagation and amplification of problems such as racism and sexism [4, 6], among others. Further, these challenges exist within a computing discipline that is already burdened by exclusive, marginalizing cultures and practices that lead to low participation by women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) [3]. Our project, AI + Dance, attends to these dimensions of inequity within AI/ML education through developing our understanding of how we can equip learners to recognize and rectify issues of AI and ML systems within an inclusive and culturally sustaining experience. We explore this in collaboration with STEM From Dance1 (SFD), a non-profit organization that supports girls of color in creative production with dance, CS, and STEM. In our prior work with SFD, we developed danceON, an open-access creative coding environment that enables learners to create code to engage authentically with dance and body motion [5]. With danceON, learners can code animations that can bind and respond to body positions and be statically and dynamically positioned in space. The system provides two ways to explore AI and ML. First, it integrates a pose detection machine learning model (PoseNet [8]) that consists of body points (i.e., Left Ear, Nose, etc.) and confidence scores for these key points, which are all accessible within the code. Second, danceON enables learners to import a model trained in Google’s Teachable Machine [2] to access the probabilistic classifier to manipulate and trigger animations. While we have explored the use of danceON to enable learners to build culturally relevant artistic artifacts [5], we have yet to explore how we can teach AI and ML concepts and ethics through the use of the system. We investigate two research questions through the co-design of culturally sustaining AI/ML resources with teachers: RQ1) How can we authentically build on learners’ identities, cultural knowledge, and practices with dance as they build, explore, and critique ML and AI models and systems? RQ2) How can we leverage learners’ creative, embodied experiences with ML and AI to facilitate reflection and critique of CS and AI/ML within their communities and society more broadly? We focus on co-design as a method that facilitates sustainability through centering teachers’ values, ownership, and authentic contexts in the realization, implementation, and evaluation of learning designs [7]. Through co-designing curricular resources, we will develop a set of modules aligned with the AI4K12 guidelines [1] that builds our understanding of creating culturally sustaining educational resources to teach about AI and ethical design in ways that leverage the culturally situated, collaborative, and embodied nature of dance.","Castro, Francisco Enrique Vicente and DesPortes, Kayla and Payne, William and Bergner, Yoav and McDermott, Kathleen","Machine learning, Artistic computing, AI ethics, Creative computing, Artificial intelligence, danceON, Dance",10.1145/3501709.3544275,2022,2

inproceedings,"A Scenario-Based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics","Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools.","Li, Xiaotian Vivian and Rosson, Mary Beth and Robert, Jenay","learning analytics, higher education, privacy, scenarios, adoption, instructors, survey, design",10.1145/3491140.3528271,2022,12

article,Artificial Intelligence in Underwater Digital Twins Sensor Networks,"The particularity of the marine underwater environment has brought many challenges to the development of underwater sensor networks (UWSNs). This research realized the effective monitoring of targets by UWSNs and achieved higher quality of service in various applications such as communication, monitoring, and data transmission in the marine environment. After analysis of the architecture, the marine integrated communication network system (MICN system) is constructed based on the maritime wireless Mesh network (MWMN) by combining with the UWSNs. A distributed hybrid fish swarm optimization algorithm (FSOA) based on mobility of underwater environment and artificial fish swarm (AFS) theory is proposed in response to the actual needs of UWSNs. The proposed FSOA algorithm makes full use of the perceptual communication of sensor nodes and lets the sensor nodes share the information covered by each other as much as possible, enhancing the global search ability. In addition, a reliable transmission protocol NC-HARQ is put forward based on the combination of network coding (NC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). In this work, three sets of experiments are performed in an area of 200 \texttimes{} 200 \texttimes{} 200 m. The simulation results show that the FSOA algorithm can fully cover the events, effectively avoid the blind movement of nodes, and ensure consistent distribution density of nodes and events. The NC-HARQ protocol proposed uses relay nodes for retransmission, and the probability of successful retransmission is much higher than that of the source node. At a distance of more than 2,000 m, the successful delivery rate of data packets is as high as 99.6%. Based on the MICN system, the intelligent ship constructed with the digital twins framework can provide effective ship operating state prediction information. In summary, this study is of great value for improving the overall performance of UWSNs and advancing the monitoring of marine data information.","Lv, Zhihan and Chen, Dongliang and Feng, Hailin and Wei, Wei and Lv, Haibin","underwater sensor networks, digital twins, Marine monitoring, artificial intelligence",10.1145/3519301,2022,27

SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal.","Dragert, Christopher and Kienzle, J\""{o}rg and Verbrugge, Clark","statecharts, reuse, computer games, AI",No data,2012,7

inproceedings,Evaluation of StarCraft Artificial Intelligence Competition Bots by Experienced Human Players,"StarCraft is one of the most successful real-time strategy (RTS) games and is also actively being researched by artificial intelligence (AI) communities. Since 2010, game AI researchers have hosted annual AI competition events to develop human-level RTS AIs using StarCraft. It ranks the AI bots by their winning ratio from thousands of AI vs. AI matches without human involvement. It is questionable whether successful AI bots are also competitive and preferable to human players. In this study, we invited 20 experienced players with varying expertise to evaluate skill levels, overall performance and human likeness of AI bots. Results show that human's ranking of AI bots are not identical to the current one from AI competitions. It suggests the need for developing new AI competitions that consider human factors (""human-likeness"" or ""adaptation""). Also, it revealed that the expertise levels of human players have high impact on overall performance and human-likeness evaluations of AI bots. It supports the concept of dynamically adjusting AI bots to satisfy different levels of human players. The outcomes of this study will also be useful to incorporate human factors in other active video AI competitions (e.g., Angry Birds, Fighting Game, and General Game Playing).","Kim, Man-Je and Kim, Kyung-Joong and Kim, SeungJun and Dey, Anind K.","AI bots, turing test, AI competitions, real-time strategy games",10.1145/2851581.2892305,2016,7

inproceedings,Paraconsistent Annotated Logic Artificial Intelligence Study in Support of Manager Decision-Making,"The philosopher Aristotle seeks the definition of man as a political being, responsible for making decisions. Political decisions generate changes in their environment and in producing change they seek constant adaptations, which in turn leads to contradictions, inconsistencies, truths, falsehoods. So soon, studies of the non-classical logical calls [2] have become a tool as an aid in the making of decisions. The logic calls attention to the brilliance of containing provisions contrary to some of the basic principles of Aristotelian Logic, such as the contradiction. In this article, the use of the technology allows proposing a structured decision making contained in the unified process Paraconsistent Logic. The unified process Paraconsistent Logic aims to be a facilitator in supporting the construction of the decision support and adherent the Paraconsistent Decision Method proposed in the studies with announcements for project recount in the function point analysis technique. A network of paraconsistent analysis can be used applications focused on the use of artificial intelligence, situations that the classic logic does not meet in its fullness, for the simple fact of operating with only two states, true or false, paraconsistent has a lot of room to deal with data inconsistencies and with real-world uncertainties.","de Lima, Alessandro W.

inproceedings,"Integrating Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion throughout the Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence in Health","Health care systems are the infrastructures that are put together to deliver health and social services to the population at large. These organizations are increasingly applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health and social care. Unfortunately, both health care systems and AI are confronted with a lack of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). This short paper focuses on the importance of integrating EDI concepts throughout the life cycle of AI in health. We discuss the risks that the lack of EDI in the design, development and implementation of AI-based tools might have on the already marginalized communities and populations in the healthcare setting. Moreover, we argue that integrating EDI principles and practice throughout the lifecycle of AI in health has an important role in achieving health equity for all populations. Further research needs to be conducted to explore how studies in AI-health have integrated.","Nyariro, Milka and Emami, Elham and Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi, Samira","Ethics, Health Equity, Health systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)",10.1145/3532530.3539565,2022,4
inproceedings,Information Digitization and Artificial Intelligence Applied in Smart Car HCI Development,"Today's digitalization has become a staple of life, and consumers' escalating digital lifestyles and demand for convenient services are directly driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. The car will no longer be a single-function transport but will become an intelligent mobile terminal providing mobility services. The influx of digital services into the car will result in a dramatic transformation of the relationship between the driver and the car, where the car will act as an intelligent mobile terminal to transfer and communicate information with people or the surrounding environment, which will lead to an explosion of information in the car, and due to the limitations of human information processing capabilities, this may make the currently established design of human-computer interaction in the car no longer applicable. If we continue to view the human-vehicle relationship through the lens of a control-oriented machine interface, this will place strong constraints on the design of intelligent human-vehicle interaction. The core of the future intelligent vehicle HCI field is a richer and more diverse information interaction between vehicle, human, and environment, so changing the concept from HCI to human-vehicle information interaction may well support the development of future intelligent vehicle systems. In this article, the exploitation of a human-vehicle interaction assistance system for the handover of control of a vehicle under conditional automation is used as an example to discuss how human information interaction is applicable to the automotive domain.","Chen, Keqi and Ma, Jun and Zhang, Yiming","Drive takeover, Human information interaction, Cognitive work analysis, HCI, Human-vehicle interaction",10.1145/3495018.3501063,2022,4
inproceedings,"AI and Us: Ethical Concerns, Public Knowledge and Public Attitudes on Artificial Intelligence","In the first part I present a theoretical study of ethical challenges arising from the development and application of AI, while in the second part I present an empirical study of public attitudes towards the various aspects of AI use, which I have conducted. Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems that mimic human cognitive functions and that are designed to achieve specific goals, execute tasks, make decisions or achieve goals in complex situations autonomously.AI can greatly facilitate people's daily and business lives, but it also brings challenges, such as privacy, transparency, discrimination, job loss, and responsibility. One of the main challenges related to the adoption and implementation of AI is the current connotations and perceptions of the subject. To some people, AI is a mysterious concept, and it is difficult to understand how it manifests in their daily lives. The development and application of AI raise several ethical issues, including the interaction of AI with human rights such as privacy and discrimination [2]. Previous studies [1, 3-5] have examined some aspects of AI. In this study, I have employed a new scale to measure the general attitudes of the public towards AI.I have conducted an empirical study of public attitudes towards various aspects of the use of AI. The participants were the public in Serbia (N=737) who filled out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of general socio-demographic questions, questions about familiarity with AI, a brief introduction to the concept of AI, and questions about participants' attitudes towards the use of AI. Participants were asked to what degree they (dis)agree with the statements on the 5-point Likert scale. I have investigated whether age, education, previous knowledge of AI, profession, and level of religiosity influences people's attitudes towards AI. Objectives were to (1) examine the public's attitudes in Serbia toward the use of AI; (2) determine which factors influence these attitudes; (3) examine whether the public shares the concerns identified by ethical philosophers in the debates on AI; (4) examine prior knowledge of the public on AI. Data were analyzed in the R programming language. The general attitude towards the use of AI was assessed by creating a composite score based on the questions in which the respondents expressed their attitudes towards different aspects of the use of AI.The results showed that the public in Serbia has a divided opinion on the use of AI. Half of them have positive, and the other half negative attitudes. These attitudes are influenced by variables such as the respondents' age, education, profession, level of religiosity, and prior knowledge of AI, in a way that young, highly educated, non-religious, those with highly qualified jobs, especially IT professionals, and those who are more familiar with the concept of AI, have more positive attitudes towards the use of AI. Also, the results showed that the public is concerned about the disappearance of professions due to the development of AI and discrimination by AI systems. The results suggest a need to educate the public about challenges and ways to prevent them. It is necessary to increase transparency in decision-making processes related to the implementation of AI and dialogue between the public on the one hand and the state and the private sector on the other. I argue that considering different aspects of public attitudes toward AI enhances this debate. The results are valuable for future work on this topic because similar public opinion polls have not been conducted, especially not in Serbia. Public opinion has not shaped conversations about the use of AI. Another focus should be on further research of the attitudes of the public and experts on specific applications of AI and related ethical challenges. This research has implications for future research, particularly when forming an AI attitude scale.","Budic, Marina","ethical concerns, knowledge, public attitudes, AI",10.1145/3514094.3539518,2022,1
inproceedings,Evaluation of Level 2 Automated Driving Artificial Intelligence Readiness in Simulated Scenarios,"Recent advances in state-of-the-art camera-based AI mechanisms in the automated driving field have leveraged great progress in the installation and widespread use of this technology along the recent years. However, vehicles with automated driving capabilities are usually equipped with a wide range of sensors that complement the perception capacity of camera-based AI algorithms. For this reason, this paper tries to reveal the degree of readiness of one of the most used open-source AI models for Level 2 automated driving. To this end, a set of simulated common driving scenarios were used to evaluate the predictions. The results obtained clearly indicate that the current capacity of this camera-based DNN model is not sufficient to be the only source of information in the process of environment perception of a Level 2 automated vehicle, and therefore, further progress in the context awareness needs to be achieved to consider its sole use in the perception stage.","Tena-Gago, David and Wang, Qi and Alcaraz-Calero, Jose M.","AI, Camera-based detection, Perception, ADAS",10.1145/3568160.3570232,2022,8

article,Performance-Driven X-Architecture Routing Algorithm&nbsp;for Artificial Intelligence Chip Design in Smart Manufacturing,"The new 7-nm Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip is an important milestone recently announced by the IBM research team, with a very important optimization goal of performance. This chip technology can be extended to various business scenarios in the Internet of Things. As the basic model for very large scale integration routing, the Steiner minimal tree can be used in various practical problems, such as wirelength optimization and timing closure. Further considering the X-architecture and the routing resources within obstacles, an effective performance-driven X-architecture routing algorithm for AI chip design in smart manufacturing is proposed to improve the delay performance of the chip. First, a special particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the discrete length-restricted X-architecture Steiner minimum tree problem in combination with genetic operations, and a particle encoding scheme is presented to encode each particle into an initial routing tree. Second, two lookup tables based on pins and obstacles are established to provide a fast information query for the whole algorithm flow. Third, a strategy of candidate point selection is designed to make the particles satisfy the constraints. Finally, a refinement strategy is implemented to further improve the quality of the final routing tree. Compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves a better total wirelength, which is an important index of performance, thus better satisfying the demand for delay performance of AI chip design in smart manufacturing.","Liu, Genggeng and Zhu, Yuhan and Xu, Saijuan and Tang, Hao and Chen, Yeh-Cheng","X-architecture routing, Steiner minimal tree, refinement strategy, particle swarm optimization, resource relaxation, Artificial intelligence chip design, smart manufacturing",10.1145/3519422,2022,20

Build a model based on it. And standardize all data. In the second step, since the factors may have a certain correlation, the principal component analysis method is used to convert the equi-related variables into another set of unrelated variables and establish a model. The third step is to analyze the health and sustainability levels of higher education systems in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries based on this model, and obtain rankings and comprehensive scores.

inproceedings,A Blockchain-Based Architecture for Query and Registration of Student Degree Certificates,"Blockchain is an emerging technology that has piqued the interest of researchers and industry today. Following the success of this technology in the financial market with virtual currencies, blockchain begins to be used by different domains such as government and education as it provides a reliable, scalable and unchanging distributed environment for conducting and storing transactions on a network. Higher education is a system with many challenges that could be solved by adopting this technology. Protecting data transactions that involve student degrees is one of the challenges considered by educational institutions. Thus, this paper presents a reference architecture proposal based on blockchain technology and a proof of concept to register and consult student certificates issued by higher education institutions. With this architecture, we intend to evaluate a new business model in this technology applied to the educational domain. As a proof of concept, we presented a prototype implementation using smart contracts based on the Ethereum platform and an evaluation made by experts in high education.","Abreu, Antonio Welligton S. and Coutinho, Emanuel F. and Bezerra, Carla I.

article,Why Real Citizens Would Turn to Artificial Leaders,"Governments are increasingly using artificial intelligence to improve workflows and services. Applications range from predicting climate change, crime, and earthquakes to flu outbreaks, low air quality, and tax fraud. Artificial agents are already having an impact on eldercare, education, and open government, enabling users to complete procedures through a conversational interface. Whether replacing humans or assisting them, they are the technological fix of our times. In two experiments and a follow-up study, we investigate factors that influence the acceptance of artificial agents in positions of power, using attachment theory and disappointment theory as explanatory models. We found that when the state of the world provokes anxiety, citizens perceive artificial agents as a reliable proxy to replace human leaders. Moreover, people accept artificial agents as decision-makers in politics and security more willingly when they deem their leaders or government to be untrustworthy, disappointing, or immoral. Finally, we discuss these results with respect to theories of technology acceptance and the delegation of duties and prerogatives.","Spatola, Nicolas and Macdorman, Karl F.","attitudes, artificial intelligence, technology acceptance, trust, competence, Agents",10.1145/3447954,2021,24

One idea in order to make Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems more explainable is to use cognitive methods that humans use when reasoning. For instance, argumentation is a common method that humans use when they explain an opinion [13]. In this paper, we introduce a framework that produces the visualization of an explanation from an argumentation dialogue, and can be easily understood by any user. More specifically, we utilize the argumentation tree that Gorgias returns [7] for the acceptability of an argument, to create a graph that represents the explanation of the argumentation tree.","Vassiliades, Alexandros and Papadimitriou, Ilias and Bassiliades, Nick and Patkos, Theodore","Argumentation, Explainability, Visualization, Argumentation Dialogue",10.1145/3503823.3503852,2022,6

Several of the current mainstream online translation tools for translating English literature related to health management education have been tested. The knowledge of health management translated by the online translation tool is translated into the mother tongue for the evaluation of the students’ cognitive ability of the relevant knowledge. The online questionnaire was used to provide feedback on students’ understanding and mastery of health management knowledge translated into their native language. The mainstream online translation tools already allow students to translate basic health education materials into their native language. The mainstream translation tools with the assistance of artificial intelligence can achieve high accuracy in the translation of short sentences in health education materials. The results show that the online translation of health education materials from non-native language to native language can basically enable students to obtain the correct understanding of health education materials. Of course, converting long sentences in health education materials into short sentences to improve the accuracy of intelligent translation tools can effectively improve the cognitive effect.

inproceedings,Research on the Design of Lexical-chunks Centered Mode of Writing under Artificial Intelligence in College English Course,"In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, English learning resources have become more abundant, and the ways for students to obtain English learning resources have become more convenient, which has prompted changes in the traditional teacher-centered English model. More and more higher education institutions and scholars focus on cultivating students' autonomous English learning abilities and advocate a student-oriented English teaching model. This paper designs a college English writing teaching model based on big data technology to highlight the teaching focus of lexical chunks. The research found that big data technology effectively monitors the learning process of students and gives timely feedback on the learning effect. At the same time, the teaching of lexical chunk promotes students' writing input and triggers output, which may innovate English teaching and motivate students' learning motivation. Through the comparison with the study of computational linguistics, it is also found that students' understanding of lexical chunk is basic, and it is reasonable to infer that students can not fully grasp the lexical chunks used in the daily communication in terms of the proper forms and the pragmatic functions, and misusing happens fairly frequently. The study highlights the significance of integrating the teaching mode which involves lexical chunk specifically in English textbooks and lectures for EFL, especially for students with a relatively low language proficiency.","CUI, YAN",,10.1109/ICBDIE52740.2021.00097,2021,4

article,Teaching Machine Learning in K–12 Classroom: Pedagogical and Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education,"Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is abandoning the belief that rule-based “traditional” programming is a central aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.","Tedre, Matti and Toivonen, Tapani and Kahila, Juho and Vartiainen, Henriikka and Valtonen, Teemu and Jormanainen, Ilkka and Pears, Arnold",,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097962,2021,15

These are the characteristics of management accounting. If accountants are simply proficient in finance, they lack the connection with business, do not understand business, and cannot extract valuable information from financial big data to provide solutions or suggestions for business development, which is a waste of data resources and even misleading decision-making. Today&#x0027;s finance should not only integrate into business, but also deal with data, so as to give full play to the functions of supervision and management decision-making, help improve business quality, and at the same time, make value creation develop to a higher end. The important task of higher education is to train high-quality professionals and cultivate a group of top-notch talents in this major. The same is true of management accounting [1]. At present, there is a shortage of market management accounting talents. How to cultivate high-quality management accounting talents, improve the practical ability of management accounting students, and quickly integrate into society to be a qualified management accounting, the key to professional teaching is to make students familiar with business and understand business processes, and to have management practice courses with quality and quantity.","Wu, Yanhong",,10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00035,2021,4

inproceedings,Improving Equity and Access to Higher Education Using Artificial Intelligence,"With data on education becoming more available, it has created a strong link between big data and learning analytics. This link paved the way for researchers in these fields to address several issues within higher education. In this study, we address the inequity in higher education, which is a long standing issue, that is depriving many skilled people of the fundamental right of education due to their background, gender, race, ethnicity or social class. Research has shown that deprived groups in terms of their demographics are more likely to fail. In this regard, we propose to use a deep neural network (DNN) that aims to predict students’ final results. This prior knowledge of students’ outcome could be used in favor of underprivileged groups in order to assist and enhance their chances to be successful. The conceived DNN consists of a binary classifier that is trained on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, with the aim to classify students into two categories: fail or pass, given a specific module and based on their demographics and interaction with the virtual learning environment. The obtained results are promising and show that deep learning could be an effective tool to promote equity in higher education. Moreover, they reveal that this latter is also a powerful tool for exploring big data within learning analytics, provided that deep neural networks become more accurate when they are provided with additional data.","Cheddadi, Saoussen and Bouache, Mourad",,10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569548,2021,6

inproceedings,OJ Intelligent Training System based on Artificial Intelligence for Hierarchical Personalized Teaching,"This paper introduces a new feature of the OJ system at Donghua University: intelligent training. Compared to other OJ systems, our OJ has the following features: 1) A clustering algorithm is used to classify the problems. When a student completes a category of problems, he or she passes a level and is awarded the corresponding score. 2) The system intelligently determines whether a student can pass the level or not. Generally, students with higher abilities need to complete fewer problems but receive higher scores. 3) The system uses a classification algorithm to determine whether plagiarism has occurred based on the code submitted by the student and the behavioral characteristics of the student at the time of submission, thus preventing plagiarism as much as possible. 4) The system uses a BP neural network to predict students' final exam scores, and then uses that predicted value as a point for reflecting ability to enhance students' sense of achievement in completing the practices. The OJ intelligent training model, based on the above features, allows students to train themselves at different levels according to their ability. Weaker students can practice more at lower levels to strengthen their foundation, while stronger students can practice more at higher levels to compete in competitions. This achieves the goal of personalized teaching at different levels and achieves better teaching results.","Huang, Qiubo and Liu, Zixuan and Lu, Ting",,10.1109/ICAIE53562.2021.00044,2021,6

institute (HEI) affects students' learning performance and combines the
existing literature to develop measurement tools and to obtain a formal
questionnaire after pre-research and received 561 valid questionnaires
collected from HEIs in China that have applied AI. Then we used SmartPLS
3.0 to construct a partial least squares structural equation model
(PLS-SEM) for data analysis on the received data samples. The research
results show that: 1) HEIs' artificial intelligence capability is a
three-order variable and formed by three formative second-order
variables such as resources (data, technical, basic resources), skills
(technical skills, teaching applications, collaboration competencies),
and consciousness (reform, innovation consciousness); 2) HEIs'
artificial intelligence capability significantly affects students'
self-efficacy and creativity; 3) HEIs' artificial intelligence
capability affects students' learning performance via two mediating
variables: student creativity and self-efficacy. This study focuses on
AI applications within the HEI, confirms the new explanatory power of
resource-based theory in technological practices, and deconstructs the

Skills","In the context of the information age, the development of artificial
intelligence is flourishing, and it is becoming more and more closely
integrated with economic life, which is an inevitable trend of future
social development. Education is also inseparable from the support of
science and technology. The penetration of artificial intelligence has
changed traditional teaching models and methods. Under the influence of
artificial intelligence technology, college education is developing more
and more in the direction of informatization and intelligence. For
college teachers, the study and application of artificial intelligence
is an important and necessary means to achieve professional development.
It is more important to train students to take independent self-study
exams and focus on applying social skills, so that students can better
adapt to the coming era of intelligence. Therefore, the purpose of this
article is to explore the development of higher education and the
improvement of teaching skills based on artificial intelligence and to
analyze the problems and solutions in the process of higher education
development. This article will use the research methods of specific
problems and specific analysis to compare the data and draw conclusions.
The research results show that in the information-based education
innovation created by knowledge sharing, the teaching goals and methods
are constantly changing. And about 85\% of the students believe that the
development prospect of intelligent teaching is good, which verifies the
feasibility of artificial intelligence technology in the development of
college education. Only by training students' imagination, creativity,
critical thinking, and autonomous learning can they adapt to today's
rapidly developing society. Therefore, active learning and research on
artificial intelligence is the embodiment of cultivating lifelong
learning ability, improving rich teaching skills, constantly summing up
experience, actively improving and trimming relevant change programs,

from the Perspectives of Academics","This article investigates the perspectives of Romanian academics on
implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE). The
article analyzes the pros and cons of AI in HE, based on the views of
eighteen academics from five Romanian universities. There is a large and
heated debate about the proliferation of AI in many domains, with strong
supporters and determined deniers. Studies that research the
implications of AI enrich the evidence-based literature on the
advantages, disadvantages, threats, or opportunities that AI creates for
us, for businesses, or for societies. Though many aspects are still less
well known, attitudes toward AI are still under construction. HE is a
domain where the implications of AI create passionate discussions. HE
is, eventually, the sector that shapes the masterminds of societies'
leaders. There is a quest to find the perspectives of those who will
apply AI, who will work with or for AI, and those who are opposed to or
in favor of implementing AI in HE. The conclusions revealed by this
study are in line with similar studies that exist in the literature. The
positive aspects of AI implementation in HE are related, in the view of
academics, to gains in the learning-teaching process, improvements in
students skills and competences, better inclusion, and greater
efficiency in administrative costs. Similarly, the negative aspects
revealed by the research are linked to psychosocial effects, data
security, ethical aspects, and unemployment threats. However, there are
some aspects (mostly negative) related to implementing AI in HE that are
less exposed by the interviewed academics, which are mostly related to
the costs and efforts of implementing AI in HE. The possible explanation
of this situation is related to the lack of strategic vision on what, in
fact, the implementation of AI in HE means, what this process involves,
and the fact that digitalization in Romanian universities (as well as in
the Romanian economy) is in its infancy. The contribution of the results
of this research is mainly empirical and practical. These opinions
should be used as resources for managers of HE institutions to develop
better policies concerning the implementation of AI in HE and for
strategic vision toward AI, with the ultimate purpose of achieving
progress and prosperity for the entire society.","Pisica, Alina Iorga and Edu, Tudor and Zaharia, Rodica Milena and

Teaching in Higher Education? A Conceptual Paper","Artificial Intelligence in higher education (AIED) is becoming a more
important research area with increasing developments and application of
AI within the wider society. However, as yet AI based tools have not
been widely adopted in higher education. As a result there is a lack of
sound evidence available on the pedagogical impact of AI for learning
and teaching. This conceptual paper thus seeks to bridge the gap and
addresses the following question: is artificial intelligence really the
new big thing that will revolutionise learning and teaching in higher
education? Adopting the technological pedagogical content knowledge
(TPACK) framework and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology (UTAUT) as the theoretical foundations, we argue that
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, at least in their current
state of development, do not afford any real new advances for pedagogy
in higher education. This is mainly because there does not seem to be
valid evidence as to how the use of AI technologies and applications has
helped students improve learning, and/or helped tutors make effective
pedagogical changes. In addition, the pedagogical affordances of AI have
not yet been clearly defined. The challenges that the higher education
sector is currently experiencing relating to AI adoption are discussed
at three hierarchical levels, namely national, institutional and
personal levels. The paper ends with recommendations with regard to
accelerating AI use in universities. This includes developing dedicated
AI adoption strategies at the institutional level, updating the existing

studies; AI technology is most commonly applied in engineering
(including computer courses); AI technologies most often play the role
of profiling and prediction in higher education, followed by intelligent

issues, the most frequently discussed issues are learning behaviour,
accuracy, sensitivity and precision, cognition and affect. Learners'
higher order thinking skills, collaboration or communication,
self-efficacy or confidence and skills are less frequently discussed in

article,"Learning to work with the black box: Pedagogy for a world with
artificial intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrating into our
society. University education needs to maintain its relevance in an
AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to
engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI
according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a
particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement
about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be
traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a `black box'.
Rather than seeking to explain `black boxes', we argue that a pedagogy
for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial
and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships
between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI
as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts
of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a)
orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be
called the tacit and explicit `rules of the game'; and (b) providing
meaningful interactions with AI systems.","Bearman, Margaret and Ajjawi, Rola","artificial intelligence; generative AI; higher education; evaluative

GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to
questions in real-time, has redefined the boundaries of academic and

Method: ChatGPT was tested against six subjects across the first three
years of the medical radiation science undergraduate course for both
exams (n = 6) and written assignment tasks (n = 3). ChatGPT submissions
were marked against standardised rubrics and results compared to student
cohorts. Submissions were also evaluated by Turnitin for similarity and
AI scores.Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 performed below the
average student performance in all written tasks with an increasing
disparity as subjects advanced. ChatGPT performed better than the
average student in foundation or general subject examinations where
shallow responses meet learning outcomes. For discipline specific
subjects, ChatGPT lacked the depth, breadth, and currency of insight to
provide pass level answers.Conclusion: ChatGPT simultaneously poses a
risk to academic integrity in writing and assessment while affording a
tool for enhanced learning environments. These risks and benefits are
likely to be restricted to learning outcomes of lower taxonomies. Both
risks and benefits are likely to be constrained by higher order
taxonomies. Implications for practice: ChatGPT powered by GPT3.5 has

article,From Brain Science to Artificial Intelligence,"Reviewing the history of the development of artificial intelligence (AI)
clearly reveals that brain science has resulted in breakthroughs in AI,
such as deep learning. At present, although the developmental trend in
AI and its applications has surpassed expectations, an insurmountable
gap remains between AI and human intelligence. It is urgent to establish
a bridge between brain science and AI research, including a link from
brain science to AI, and a connection from knowing the brain to
simulating the brain. The first steps toward this goal are to explore
the secrets of brain science by studying new brain-imaging technology;
to establish a dynamic connection diagram of the brain; and to integrate
neuroscience experiments with theory, models, and statistics. Based on
these steps, a new generation of AI theory and methods can be studied,
and a subversive model and working mode from machine perception and
learning to machine thinking and decision-making can be established.

article,Moral Awareness of College Students Regarding Artificial Intelligence,"To evaluate the moral awareness of college students regarding artificial
intelligence (AI) systems, we have examined 467 surveys collected from
152 Japanese and 315 non-Japanese students in an international
university in Japan. The students were asked to choose a most
significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list
of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show
that most of the students (n = 269, 58\%) considered unemployment to be
the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of
students (n = 54, 12\%) was concerned with ethical issues related to
emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion
and robots' rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students
referred to the risk of social control by AI (6\%), AI discrimination
(6\%), increasing inequality (5\%), loss of privacy (4\%), AI mistakes
(3\%), malicious AI (3\%), and AI security breaches (3\%). Calculation
of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese
students were much less concerned about AI control of society (- 3.1276,

cognitive radios that can optimize performance by adapting to network
conditions. Although various routing protocols incorporating varying
degrees of adaptiveness and cognition have been proposed for CRNs, these

systems would become the norm in classrooms in just fifteen years. Five
years since the publication of that report, we need to know the current

relationship between the teacher-recommended use of ICT and artificial
intelligence in the writing process and how this technology is actually
used by students. Another aim is to determine what type of automated
assessment and corrective feedback is applied by teachers and what
perception both groups have about the use of ICT and AI. To conduct this
study, we designed two ad hoc questionnaires, which were completed by 53
professors and 101 students from the Polytechnic University of Valencia
(UPV) and the University of Valencia (UV). One result from this research
is that while 79\% of teachers recommend using ICT, only 61.4\% of
students follow this recommendation. One conclusion we can draw is that

article,"Analysis on the Particularity of Higher Education Subject Development
under the Background of Artificial Intelligence","Subject development plays a crucial role in higher education (HE),
improving student academic performance. The HE continuously requires
conceptual and empirical development to deliver valuable content to the
students. The subject reforms offer quality, accessibility,
affordability, accountability, and equity to accomplish continual
learning. The changes in higher education subjects require a continuous
assessment to understand the relationship between the reform and student
performance. The subject development quality is evaluated using machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The existing
researchers use intelligent techniques to identify student academic
performance. However, the exact relationship between student performance
and subject changes fails to address. Therefore, higher education
learning (HEL) requires improvement to manage the Higher Education
Subject Development (HESD). To achieve the research goal, AdaBoost
Adaptive-Bidirectional Associative Memory (AA-BAM) network is introduced
in this work. The network model uses the Hebbian supervised learning
(HSL) process to create the training model. The learning process has a
network parameter updating procedure that reduces the total error and
deviation between the academic details. In addition, the neural model
uses the memory cell that stores every processing information that
recalls the output patterns with maximum accuracy. The output pattern
identifies the student's academic performance, which helps to analyze
the quality of the subject development in institutions. The created

article,"Supporting students' self-regulated learning in online learning using
artificial intelligence applications","Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for helping students attain
high academic performance and achieve their learning objectives in the
online learning context. However, learners often face challenges in
properly applying SRL in online learning environments. Recent
developments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications have shown
promise in supporting learners' self-regulation in online learning by
measuring and augmenting SRL, but research in this area is still in its
early stages. The purpose of this study is to explore students'
perceptions of the use of AI applications to support SRL and to identify
the pedagogical and psychological aspects that they perceive as
necessary for effective utilization of those AI applications. To explore
this, a speed dating method using storyboards was employed as an
exploratory design method. The study involved the development of 10 AI
application storyboards to identify the phases and areas of SRL, and
semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 university students
from various majors. The results indicated that learners perceived AI
applications as useful for supporting metacognitive, cognitive, and
behavioral regulation across different SRL areas, but not for regulating
motivation. Next, regarding the use of AI applications to support SRL,
learners requested consideration of three pedagogical and psychological
aspects: learner identity, learner activeness, and learner position. The
findings of this study offer practical implications for the design of AI
applications in online learning, with the aim of supporting students'
SRL.","Jin, Sung-Hee and Im, Kowoon and Yoo, Mina and Roll, Ido and Seo,

empirical study considering artificial intelligence usefulness,
interactive reward, satisfaction, university support and enjoyment","The new era of technologies represented by artificial intelligence is
profoundly reconstructing the field of education. The integration of
emerging technologies in intelligent teaching provides new approaches
for improving teaching effectiveness and enriching learning experiences.
Today, we know little about students' participation in intelligent
teaching with the help of artificial intelligence. In this study, we
investigated the mechanism of students' involvement in intelligent
teaching. We designed a questionnaire for the confirmatory model of the
participation of intelligent teaching through literature research and
content analysis. After modeling and empirical analysis with the help of
partial least structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) software (SmartPLS
3.0), we found that: satisfaction, university support, perceived
enjoyment, and interactive rewards all indirectly affect intelligent
teaching participation through mediating variables (i.e., participation
intention and interactivity); participation intention and interactivity
directly and positively affect intelligent teaching participation;
artificial intelligence usefulness positively moderates the
relationships between the two mediating variables (participation
intention, interactivity) and intelligent teaching participation. Based
on the results of the data analysis, this study offered corresponding
optimization strategies: improving students' participation experience in
intelligent teaching through using the new technology ``artificial

applied to student assessment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being
implemented in more and more fields, including education. The main uses
of AI in education are related to tutoring and assessment. This paper
analyzes the use of AI for student assessment based on a systematic
review. For this purpose, a search was carried out in two databases:
Scopus and Web of Science. A total of 454 papers were found and, after
analyzing them according to the PRISMA Statement, a total of 22 papers
were selected. It is clear from the studies analyzed that, in most of
them, the pedagogy underlying the educational action is not reflected.
Similarly, formative evaluation seems to be the main use of AI. Another
of the main functionalities of AI in assessment is for the automatic
grading of students. Several studies analyze the differences between the
use of AI and its non-use. We discuss the results and conclude the need
for teacher training and further research to understand the
possibilities of AI in educational assessment, mainly in other

article,"Factors Affecting the Adoption of AI-Based Applications in Higher
Education: An Analysis of Teachers' Perspectives Using Structural
Equation Modeling","Owing to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies, there has been increasing concern about how to promote the
use of AI technologies in school settings to enhance students' learning
performance. Teachers' intention to adopt AI tools in their classes
plays a crucial role in this regard. Therefore, it is important to
explore factors affecting teachers' intention to incorporate AI
technologies or applications into course designs in higher education. In
this study, a structural equation modeling approach was employed to
investigate teachers' continuance intention to teach with AI. In the
proposed model, 10 hypotheses regarding anxiety (AN), self-efficacy
(SE), attitude towards Al (ATU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and
perceived usefulness (PU) were tested, and this study explored how these
factors worked together to influence teachers' continuance intention. A
total of 311 teachers in higher education participated in the study.
Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the five
endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 70.4\% of the
changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of
BI. The total effect of ATU was 0.793, followed by SE, with a total
effect of 0.554. As a result, the intentions of teachers to learn to use
AI-based applications in their teaching can be predicted by ATU, SE,
PEU, PU and AN. Among them, teachers' SE positively influenced teachers'
PEU and ATU towards adopting AI-based applications, and also influenced
PU through PEU. In addition, the relationship between teachers' SE and
AN was negatively correlated, which indicated that enhancing teachers'
SE could reduce their AN towards using AI-based applications in their
teaching. Accordingly, implications and suggestions for researchers and

article,Artificial intelligence in medicine,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a
computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention.
Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots.
The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic
machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's
lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery,
named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da
Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation.
AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent
machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad
range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical
statistics, and human biology up to and including today's ``omics{''}.
AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main
branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics
approaches from deep learning information management to control of
health management systems, including electronic health records, and
active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical
branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient
or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted
nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical
complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of
their medical utility, economic value, and development of

Regarding the Perceptions of the Key Future Competences","The purpose of this article is to identify the differences in various
aspects of the perception of artificial intelligence by students of
economics and business studies at different levels of study and, on this
basis, to formulate recommendations both to the higher education
institutions themselves, which educate in the field of economic and
business sciences, as well as to curriculum designers. First, we
utilized descriptive statistics to analyze the responses for each
construct among undergraduate and postgraduate students. In the second
part, we employed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests to
assess the normality of data distribution. Finally, in the third part,
we employed the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test to identify the
differences between undergraduate and postgraduate students. The results
show that statistically significant differences can be identified
especially in how students of both study levels see and understand the
importance of AI. Although we did not identify significant differences
between students of both levels in how they see their role in the future
labor market, which will be (or already is) characterized by artificial
intelligence, we must emphasize that students of both levels evaluate
their roles modestly in this respect. Therefore, on this basis, we have
made recommendations for more active development and integration of AI

profound changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now applied in many
industries, particularly in healthcare and medical education, where it
deeply intersects. The purpose of this paper is to overview the current
situation and problems of ``AI+medicine/medical{''} education and to
provide our own perspective on the current predicament. Methods: We
searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and CNKI databases to assess the
literature on AI+medical/medical education from 2017 to July 2022. The
main inclusion criteria include literature describing the current
situation or predicament of ``AI+medical/medical education{''}. Results:
Studies have shown that the current application of AI in medical
education is focused on clinical specialty training and continuing
education, with the main application areas being radiology, diagnostics,
surgery, cardiology, and dentistry. The main role is to assist
physicians to improve their efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the
field of combining AI with medicine/medical education is steadily
expanding, and the most urgent need is for policy makers, experts in the
medical field, AI and education, and experts in other fields to come
together to reach consensus on ethical issues and develop regulatory
standards. Our study also found that most medical students are positive
about adding AI-related courses to the existing medical curriculum.
Finally, the quality of research on ``AI+medical/medical education{''}

to use artificial intelligence (AI) to read human emotions, and to
predict human behavior or actions that may follow those emotions.
However, a person's emotions cannot be easily identified, measured, and
evaluated by others, including automated machines and algorithms run by

examined the emotional variables as well as the perception of emotional
AI in two large random groups of college students in an international
university in Japan, with a heavy representation of Japanese,
Indonesian, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and other Asian
nationalities. Surveys with multiple close-ended questions and an
open-ended essay question regarding emotional AI were administered for
quantitative and qualitative analysis, respectively. The results
demonstrate how ethically questionable results may be obtained through
affective computing and by searching for correlations in a variety of
factors in collected data to classify individuals into certain
categories and thus aggravate bias and discrimination. Nevertheless, the
qualitative study of students' essays shows a rather optimistic view
over the use of emotional AI, which helps underscore the need to

article,Prospects for cardiovascular medicine using artificial intelligence,"As the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical
setting increases, the need for clinicians to understand AI is also
increasing. This review focuses on the fundamental principles of AI and
the current state of cardiovascular AI. Various types of cardiovascular
AI have been developed for evaluating examinations such as X-rays,
electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic
resonance imaging. Cardiovascular AI achieves high accuracy in
diagnostic support and prognosis prediction. Furthermore, it can even
detect abnormalities that were previously difficult for cardiologists to
detect. Randomized controlled trials begin to be reported to verify the
usefulness of cardiovascular AI. The day is approaching when
cardiovascular AI will be commonly used in clinical practice. Various
types of medical AI will be used for cardiovascular care; however, it
will not replace medical doctors. We need to understand the strengths

article,"Application of artificial intelligence ensemble learning model in early
prediction of atrial fibrillation","Background Atrial fibrillation is a paroxysmal heart disease without any
obvious symptoms for most people during the onset. The electrocardiogram
(ECG) at the time other than the onset of this disease is not
significantly different from that of normal people, which makes it
difficult to detect and diagnose. However, if atrial fibrillation is not
detected and treated early, it tends to worsen the condition and
increase the possibility of stroke. In this paper, P-wave morphology
parameters and heart rate variability feature parameters were
simultaneously extracted from the ECG. A total of 31 parameters were
used as input variables to perform the modeling of artificial
intelligence ensemble learning model. Results This paper applied three
artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods, namely Bagging
ensemble learning method, AdaBoost ensemble learning method, and
Stacking ensemble learning method. The prediction results of these three
artificial intelligence ensemble learning methods were compared. As a
result of the comparison, the Stacking ensemble learning method combined
with various models finally obtained the best prediction effect with the
accuracy of 92\%, sensitivity of 88\%, specificity of 96\%, positive
predictive value of 95.7\%, negative predictive value of 88.9\%, F1
score of 0.9231 and area under receiver operating characteristic curve
value of 0.911. Conclusion In feature extraction, this paper combined
P-wave morphology parameters and heart rate variability parameters as
input parameters for model training, and validated the value of the
proposed parameters combination for the improvement of the model's
predicting effect. In the calculation of the P-wave morphology
parameters, the hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm was used to obtain more
accurate Gaussian function fitting parameters. The prediction model was
trained using the Stacking ensemble learning method, so that the model
accuracy had better results, which can further improve the early
prediction of atrial fibrillation.","Wu, Cai and Hwang, Maxwell and Huang, Tian-Hsiang and Chen, Yen-Ming J.

gap by taking an educational perspective to review the existing
literature on artificial intelligence chatbots.
Design/methodology/approach - This study combines bibliometric analysis
and citation network analysis: a bibliometric analysis through
visualization of keyword, authors, organizations and countries and a
citation network analysis based on literature clustering.Findings -
Educational applications of chatbots are still rising in post-COVID-19

information counseling and automated grading), health-care education and
medical training. Diversifying application contexts demonstrate specific
purposes for using chatbots in education but are confronted with some
common challenges. Multi-faceted factors can influence the effectiveness
and acceptance of chatbots in education. This study provides an extended
framework to facilitate extending artificial intelligence chatbot
applications in education. Research limitations/implications - The
authors have to acknowledge that this study is subjected to some
limitations. First, the literature search was based on the core
collection on Web of Science, which did not include some existing

article,How can artificial intelligence be used for peptidomics?,"Introduction Peptidomics is an emerging field of omics sciences using
advanced isolation, analysis, and computational techniques that enable
qualitative and quantitative analyses of various peptides in biological
samples. Peptides can act as useful biomarkers and as therapeutic
molecules for diseases Areas covered The use of therapeutic peptides can
be predicted quickly and efficiently using data-driven computational
methods, particularly artificial intelligence (AI) approach. Various AI
approaches are useful for peptide-based drug discovery, such as support
vector machine, random forest, extremely randomized trees, and other
more recently developed deep learning methods. AI methods are relatively
new to the development of peptide-based therapies, but these techniques
already become essential tools in protein science by dissecting novel
therapeutic peptides and their functions (Figure 1). Expert opinion
Researchers have shown that AI models can facilitate the development of
peptidomics and selective peptide therapies in the field of peptide
science. Biopeptide prediction is important for the discovery and
development of successful peptide-based drugs. Due to their ability to
predict therapeutic roles based on sequence details, many AI-dependent

article,"An overview of artificial intelligence in diabetic retinopathy and other
ocular diseases","Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a
branch of science that empowers machines using human intelligence. AI
refers to the technology of rendering human intelligence through
computer programs. From healthcare to the precise prevention, diagnosis,
and management of diseases, AI is progressing rapidly in various
interdisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology. Ophthalmology is at
the forefront of AI in medicine because the diagnosis of ocular diseases
heavy reliance on imaging. Recently, deep learning-based AI screening
and prediction models have been applied to the most common visual
impairment and blindness diseases, including glaucoma, cataract,
age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
The success of AI in medicine is primarily attributed to the development
of deep learning algorithms, which are computational models composed of
multiple layers of simulated neurons. These models can learn the
representations of data at multiple levels of abstraction. The
Inception-v3 algorithm and transfer learning concept have been applied
in DR and ARMD to reuse fundus image features learned from natural
images (non-medical images) to train an AI system with a fraction of the
commonly used training data (<1\%). The trained AI system achieved
performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying ARMD and
diabetic macular edema on optical coherence tomography images. In this
study, we highlight the fundamental concepts of AI and its application

article,"AISAR: Artificial Intelligence-Based Student Assessment and
Recommendation System for E-Learning in Big Data","Educational systems have advanced with the use of electronic learning
(e-learning), which is a promising solution for long-distance learners.
Students who engage in e-learning can access tests and exams online,
making education more flexible and accessible. This work reports on the
design of an e-learning system that makes recommendations to students to
improve their learning. This artificial intelligence-based student
assessment and recommendation (AISAR) system consists of score
estimation, clustering, performance prediction, and recommendation. In
addition, the importance of student authentication is recognised in
situations in which students must authenticate themselves prior to using
the e-learning system using their identity, password, and personal
identification number. Individual scores are determined using a
recurrent neural network (RNN) based on student engagement and
examination scores. Then, a density-based spatial clustering algorithm
(DBSCAN) using Mahalanobis distance clustering is implemented to group
students based on their obtained score values. The constructed clusters
are validated by estimating purity and entropy. Student performance is
predicted using a threshold-based MapReduce (TMR) procedure from the
score-based cluster. When predicting student performance, students are
classified into two groups: average and poor, with the former being
divided into below- and above-average students and the latter into poor
and very poor students. This categorisation aims to provide useful
recommendations for learning. A recommendation reinforcement learning
algorithm, the rule-based state-action-reward-state-action (R-SARSA)
algorithm, is incorporated for evaluation. Students were required to
work on their subjects according to the provided recommendations. This
e-learning recommendation system achieves better performance in terms of

article,A Preliminary Survey of Muslim Experts' Views on Artificial Intelligence,"There should be a great deal of concern over the extensive and still
expanding application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in
Muslim life today. From the use of smartphones, drones, robots,
autonomous vehicles and weapons technologies, the transformation caused
by AI is significantly positive but much is still up for debate and
contemplation. In fact, some Muslims may merely consider this rapid
growth of AI as part of science fiction which is being popularised in
movies. This incognizant view is dangerous because Muslims may not be
alert to unforeseen AI impact especially when it crosses over Islamic
ethical or legal limits. These interpretations should provide an
appropriate context for Muslim experts today to rethink their views with

preliminary study therefore, is conducted to gather Muslim experts'
professional views on AI related issues. Using a quantitative
methodology approach with a cross-sectional study design, 37 experts
responded to the personal, online questionnaire emailed to them. The
findings generally indicate the respondents' insensitivity towards the
greater extent of AI impact on Muslim consumers at large. However, most
of the respondents were agreeable on the urgent need for regulations so
that AI is geared and harvested for its benefits in enhancing Muslim

Industrial Revolution. One of the core technologies mentioned is
adopting artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots. In the last few
years, there has been a growing interest in AI-based chatbot adoption in
the non-HEI context. However, most higher-education institutions (HEIs)
are reported not ready to adopt AI-based chatbots as one of the
solutions for virtual student services support. The research of chatbot
adoption in the HEI context is still new and is a less explored and
examined topic in the information systems domain. Moreover, most of the
existing research regarding chatbot adoption in the HEI context focuses
more on the benefit of chatbot usage and is not specialised in a student
services solution perspective. Furthermore, most of the studies were not
guided by the information systems (IS) theories. Therefore, this study
aims to identify factors that influence the effectiveness of chatbot
adoption in the HEI context by adapting the UTAUT2 model as the IS
theory reference. A survey method was applied using the purposive
sampling technique. For 3 months, data were collected online from 302
users of Malaysia's HEI postgraduate students from various public and
private universities. A two-stage analytical procedure (SEM-ANN) was
used to validate the research model and assess the presented research
hypotheses. This research reveals that perceived trust is influenced by
interactivity, design, and ethics. Meanwhile, behavioural intention is
influenced by perceived trust, performance expectancy, and habit towards
the use of chatbot applications in the HEI context. Lastly, the findings

article,Advancements in Oncology with Artificial Intelligence-A Review Article,"Simple Summary With the advancement of artificial intelligence,
including machine learning, the field of oncology has seen promising
results in cancer detection and classification, epigenetics, drug
discovery, and prognostication. In this review, we describe what
artificial intelligence is and its function, as well as comprehensively
summarize its evolution and role in breast, colorectal, and central
nervous system cancers. Understanding the origin and current
accomplishments might be essential to improve the quality, accuracy,
generalizability, cost-effectiveness, and reliability of artificial
intelligence models that can be used in worldwide clinical practice.
Students and researchers in the medical field will benefit from a deeper
understanding of how to use integrative AI in oncology for innovation
and research. Well-trained machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) systems can provide clinicians with therapeutic
assistance, potentially increasing efficiency and improving efficacy. ML
has demonstrated high accuracy in oncology-related diagnostic imaging,
including screening mammography interpretation, colon polyp detection,
glioma classification, and grading. By utilizing ML techniques, the
manual steps of detecting and segmenting lesions are greatly reduced.
ML-based tumor imaging analysis is independent of the experience level
of evaluating physicians, and the results are expected to be more
standardized and accurate. One of the biggest challenges is its
generalizability worldwide. The current detection and screening methods
for colon polyps and breast cancer have a vast amount of data, so they
are ideal areas for studying the global standardization of artificial
intelligence. Central nervous system cancers are rare and have poor
prognoses based on current management standards. ML offers the prospect
of unraveling undiscovered features from routinely acquired neuroimaging
for improving treatment planning, prognostication, monitoring, and
response assessment of CNS tumors such as gliomas. By studying AI in
such rare cancer types, standard management methods may be improved by
augmenting personalized/precision medicine. This review aims to provide
clinicians and medical researchers with a basic understanding of how ML
works and its role in oncology, especially in breast cancer, colorectal
cancer, and primary and metastatic brain cancer. Understanding AI

article,"Application of artificial intelligence methods in vital signs analysis
of hospitalized patients: A systematic literature review","In a hospital environment, patients are monitored continuously by
electronic devices and health professionals. Therefore, a large amount
of data is collected and stored in electronic health records systems for
each patient. Among such data, vital signs are one of the most common
and relevant types of information monitored to assess a patient's health
status. Artificial intelligence techniques can be used to analyze and
learn useful standards from clinical datasets to provide better evidence
to support the decisions of health professionals and thus help to
improve patient health outcomes in hospitals. This systematic literature
review aims to provide an updated computational perspective of how
artificial intelligence has been applied to analyze the vital signs of
adult hospitalized patients and the outcomes obtained. To this end, we
reviewed 2899 scientific articles published between 2008 and 2018 and
selected 78 articles that met our inclusion criteria to answer the
research questions. Moreover, we used the information found in the
reviewed articles to propose a taxonomy and identified the main
concerns, challenges, and opportunities in this field. Our findings
demonstrate that many researchers are exploring the use of artificial
intelligence methods in tasks related to improving the health outcomes
of hospitalized patients in distinct units. Additionally, although vital
signs are significant predictors of clinical deterioration, they are not
analyzed in isolation to predict or identify a clinical outcome. Our
taxonomy and discussion contribute to the achievement of a significant
degree of coverage regarding the aspects related to using machine
learning to improve health outcomes in hospital environments, while
highlighting gaps in the literature for future research. (C) 2020

molecular mechanisms on a macroscopic scale, there is increasing
evidence that there are multiple additional features within medical

METHODS: A total of 3,578 patients with suspected CAD undergoing SPECT
MPI and invasive coronary angiography within a 6-month interval from 9
centers were studied. CAD-DL computes the probability of obstructive CAD
from stress myocardial perfusion, wall motion, and wall thickening maps,
as well as left ventricular volumes, age, and sex. Myocardial regions
contributing to the CAD-DL prediction are highlighted to explain the
findings to the physician. A clinical prototype was integrated using a
standard clinical workstation. Diagnostic performance by CAD-DL was
compared to automated quantitative total perfusion deficit (TPD) and
reader diagnosis.
RESULTS: In total, 2,247 patients (63\%) had obstructive CAD. In 10-fold
repeated testing, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve (AUC) (95\% CI) was higher according to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.83 {[}95\%
CI: 0.82-0.85]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.78 {[}95\% CI: 0.77-0.80]) or
reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.71 {[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.72]; P < 0.0001 for
both). In external testing, the AUC in 555 patients was higher according
to CAD-DL (AUC: 0.80 {[}95\% CI: 0.76-0.84]) than stress TPD (AUC: 0.73
{[}95\% CI: 0.69-0.77]) or reader diagnosis (AUC: 0.65 {[}95\% CI:
0.61-0.69]; P < 0.001 for all). The present model can be integrated
within standard clinical software and generates results rapidly (<12
seconds on a standard clinical workstation) and therefore could readily
be incorporated into a typical clinical workflow.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep-learning model significantly surpasses the
diagnostic accuracy of standard quantitative analysis and clinical
visual reading for MPI. Explainable artificial intelligence can be
integrated within standard clinical software to facilitate acceptance of
artificial intelligence diagnosis of CAD following MPI. (C) 2022 by the

article,"Opportunities and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence for Green
Manufacturing in the Process Industry","Smart manufacturing is critical in improving the quality of the process
industry. In smart manufacturing, there is a trend to incorporate
different kinds of new-generation information technologies into
process-safety analysis. At present, green manufacturing is facing major
obstacles related to safety management, due to the usage of large
amounts of hazardous chemicals, resulting in spatial inhomogeneity of
chemical industrial processes and increasingly stringent safety and
environmental regulations. Emerging information technologies such as
artificial intelligence (AI) are quite promising as a means of
overcoming these difficulties. Based on state-of-the-art AI methods and
the complex safety relations in the process industry, we identify and
discuss several technical challenges associated with process safety: (1)
knowledge acquisition with scarce labels for process safety; (2)
knowledge-based reasoning for process safety; (3) accurate fusion of
heterogeneous data from various sources; and (4) effective learning for
dynamic risk assessment and aided decision-making. Current and future

article,"Systematic Review of Radiology Residency Artificial Intelligence
Curricula: Preparing Future Radiologists for the Artificial Intelligence
Era","Objective: Although educating radiology trainees about artificial
intelligence (AI) has become increasingly emphasized, the types of AI
educational curricula are not well understood. We performed a systematic
review of original studies describing curricula used to teach AI
concepts and practical applications for radiology residents and fellows.
Materials and methods: We performed a PubMed search for original studies
published as of July 22, 2022, describing AI curricula geared toward
radiology residents or fellows. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were
evaluated for curricula design, implementation details, and outcomes.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize these curricula. Results:
Five studies were included describing an AI curriculum, all geared
toward radiology residents. All five curricula were led by radiologists,
mostly by individual academic radiology departments (4; 80\%) with one
led by the ACR Resident and Fellow Section. Curricula design included
didactic sessions (5; 100\%), assigned readings (4; 80\%), hands-on
learning (3; 60\%), and journal clubs (3; 60\%); only one had
individualized learning plans. All four studies that evaluated the
impact of the curricula on participants' knowledge or attitudes showed
positive effects. Discussion: Amid increasing recognition of the
importance of AI education for radiologists-in-training, several AI
curricula for radiology residents have been implemented. Although
curricula designs varied and it is unclear if one type is superior, they
have had a positive impact on residents' knowledge and attitudes toward
AI. As AI becomes increasingly adopted in radiology, these curricula
serve as models for other departments and programs to develop AI
educational initiatives to prepare the next generation of radiologists
for the AI era.","Garin, Sean P. and Zhang, Vivian and Jeudy, Jean and Parekh, Vishwa S.

to predict transformation behaviors of pollutants in natural and
engineered water systems. Additionally, remarkable advancements of
artificial intelligence, including its subset machine learning, have
become major problem-solving techniques in this area. In this context,
we summarize primary applications of computational chemistry, artificial

article,Artificial intelligence in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has led to serious
health-related complications worldwide. NAFLD has wide pathological
spectra, ranging from simple steatosis to hepatitis to cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Artificial intelligence (AI), including
machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has provided great
advancement and accuracy in identifying, diagnosing, and managing
patients with NAFLD and detecting squeal such as advanced fibrosis and
risk factors for hepatocellular cancer. This review summarizes different
AI algorithms and methods in the field of hepatology, focusing on NAFLD.
Methods: A search of PubMed, WILEY, and MEDLINE databases were taken as
relevant publications for this review on the application of AI
techniques in detecting NAFLD in suspected population Results: Out of
495 articles searched in relevant databases, 49 articles were finally
included and analyzed. NASH-Scope model accurately distinguished between
NAFLD and non-NAFLD and between NAFLD without fibrosis and NASH with
fibrosis. The logistic regression (LR) model had the highest accuracy,
whereas the support vector machine (SVM) had the highest specificity and
precision in diagnosing NAFLD. An extreme gradient boosting model had
the highest performance in predicting non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

a Single Radiology Residency Training Program","Purpose: Advances in artificial intelligence applied to diagnostic
radiology are predicted to have a major impact on this medical
specialty. With the goal of establishing a baseline upon which to build
educational activities on this topic, a survey was conducted among
trainees and attending radiologists at a single residency program.
Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed. Comparisons of
categorical data between groups (trainees and attending radiologists)
were made using Pearson chi(2) analysis or an exact analysis when
required. Comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when
the data were not normally distributed. An alpha level of 0.05 was used.
Results: The overall response rate was 66\% (69 of 104). Thirty-six
percent of participants (n = 25) reported not having read a scientific
medical article on the topic of artificial intelligence during the past
12 months. Twenty-nine percent of respondents (n = 12) reported using
artificial intelligence tools during their daily work. Trainees were
more likely to express doubts on whether they would have pursued
diagnostic radiology as a career had they known of the potential impact
artificial intelligence is predicted to have on the specialty (P =
.0254) and were also more likely to plan to learn about the topic (P =
.0401).
Conclusions: Radiologists lack exposure to current scientific medical
articles on artificial intelligence. Trainees are concerned by the
implications artificial intelligence may have on their jobs and desire
to learn about the topic. There is a need to develop educational
resources to help radiologists assume an active role in guiding and
facilitating the development and implementation of artificial

article,"The moderating effects of gender and need satisfaction on self-regulated
learning through Artificial Intelligence (AI)","Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to support self-regulated
learning (SRL) because of its strong anthropomorphic characteristics.
However, most studies of AI in education have focused on cognitive
outcomes in higher education, and little research has examined how
psychological needs affect SRL with AI in the K-12 setting. SRL is a
self-directed process driven by psychological factors that can be
explained by the three basic needs of self-determination theory (SDT),
i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study fills a research
gap by examining the moderating effects of need satisfaction and gender
in predicting SRL among Grade 9 students. The results indicate that
girls perceive more need support than boys. In predicting SRL,
satisfaction of the need for autonomy and competence is moderated by
both gender and AI knowledge, whereas satisfaction of the need for
relatedness is moderated by gender only. Particularly among girls, the
effects of autonomy and competence more strongly predict SRL when AI
knowledge is low. These findings confirm the gender differences in need
satisfaction when predicting SRL with a chatbot. The findings have
implications for both teacher instruction and the design and development

roles of supportive environments and expectancy-value beliefs","Despite the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) for university
students to thrive in the future workplace, few studies have been
conducted to assess and foster their intentions to learn AI. Guided by
the situated expectancy-value theory, this study adopted both variable-
and person-centered approaches to explore the role of supportive
environments and expectancy-value beliefs in fostering university
students' intentions to learn AI. The data were drawn from 494
university students. In Study 1, the variable-centered approach of
structural equation modeling showed the critical role of supportive
environments and expectancy-value beliefs in promoting students'
intentions to learn AI. In Study 2, the person-centered approach of
latent profile analysis identified three subgroups of students based on
their levels of supportive environments and expectancy-value beliefs.
Consistent with Study 1, students who perceived more supportive
environments and higher levels of expectancy-value beliefs had stronger
intentions to learn AI. We also documented the influence of study of
field, gender, and year level on students' perceptions of supportive
environments, expectancy-value beliefs and intentions to learn AI. The

article,"Assessment of learning curves on a simulated neurosurgical task using
metrics selected by artificial intelligence","OBJECTIVE Understanding the variation of learning curves of experts and
trainees for a given surgical procedure is important in implementing
formative learning paradigms to accelerate mastery. The study objectives
were to use artificial intelligence (AI)-derived metrics to determine
the learning curves of participants in 4 groups with different expertise
levels who performed a series of identical virtual reality (VR) subpial
resection tasks and to identify learning curve differences among the 4
groups.
METHODS A total of 50 individuals participated, 14 neurosurgeons, 4
neurosurgical fellows and 10 senior residents (seniors), 10 junior
residents (juniors), and 12 medical students. All participants performed
5 repetitions of a subpial tumor resection on the NeuroVR (CAE
Healthcare) platform, and 6 a priori-derived metrics selected using the
K-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm were used to assess
participant learning curves. Group learning curves were plotted over the
5 trials for each metric. A mixed, repeated-measures ANOVA was performed
between the first and fifth trial. For significant interactions (p <
0.05), post hoc Tukey's HSD analysis was conducted to determine the
location of the significance.
RESULTS Overall, 5 of the 6 metrics assessed had a significant
interaction (p < 0.05). The 4 groups, neurosurgeons, seniors, juniors,
and medical students, showed an improvement between the first and fifth
trial on at least one of the 6 metrics evaluated.

article,Artificial Intelligence in Service,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly reshaping service by
performing various tasks, constituting a major source of innovation, yet
threatening human jobs. We develop a theory of AI job replacement to
address this double-edged impact. The theory specifies four
intelligences required for service tasks-mechanical, analytical,
intuitive, and empathetic-and lays out the way firms should decide
between humans and machines for accomplishing those tasks. AI is
developing in a predictable order, with mechanical mostly preceding
analytical, analytical mostly preceding intuitive, and intuitive mostly
preceding empathetic intelligence. The theory asserts that AI job
replacement occurs fundamentally at the task level, rather than the job
level, and for ``lower{''} (easier for AI) intelligence tasks first. AI
first replaces some of a service job's tasks, a transition stage seen as
augmentation, and then progresses to replace human labor entirely when
it has the ability to take over all of a job's tasks. The progression of
AI task replacement from lower to higher intelligences results in
predictable shifts over time in the relative importance of the
intelligences for service employees. An important implication from our
theory is that analytical skills will become less important, as AI takes
over more analytical tasks, giving the ``softer{''} intuitive and
empathetic skills even more importance for service employees.
Eventually, AI will be capable of performing even the intuitive and
empathetic tasks, which enables innovative ways of human-machine

search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of ML
and/or AI in heart transplantation in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane
database, and Google Scholar, from inception to November 2021. Results
Our search yielded 237 articles, of which 13 studies were included in
this review, featuring 463 850 patients. Three main areas of application
were identified: (1) ML for predictive modeling of heart transplantation
mortality outcomes; (2) ML in graft failure outcomes; (3) ML to aid

suggest that AI and ML are more accurate in predicting graft failure and
mortality than traditional scoring systems and conventional regression
analysis. Major predictors of graft failure and mortality identified in
ML models were: length of hospital stay, immunosuppressive regimen,
recipient's age, congenital heart disease, and organ ischemia time.
Other potential benefits include analyzing initial lab investigations

utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based educational
applications in education. As pre-service teachers' attitudes towards
educational technology that utilizes AI have a potential impact on the
learning outcomes of their future students, it is essential to know more
about pre-service teachers' acceptance of AI. The aims of this study are
(1) to discover what factors determine pre-service teachers' intentions
to utilize AI-based educational applications and (2) to determine
whether gender differences exist within determinants that affect those
behavioral intentions. A sample of 452 pre-service teachers (325 female)
participated in a survey at one German university. Based on a prominent
technology acceptance model, structural equation modeling, measurement
invariance, and multigroup analysis were carried out. The results
demonstrated that eight out of nine hypotheses were supported; perceived
ease of use (\& beta; = 0.297{*}{*}{*}) and perceived usefulness (\&
beta; = 0.501{*}{*}{*}) were identified as primary factors predicting
pre-service teachers' intention to use AI. Furthermore, the latent mean
differences results indicated that two constructs, AI anxiety (z = -
3.217{*}{*}) and perceived enjoyment (z = 2.556{*}), were significantly
different by gender. In addition, it is noteworthy that the paths from
AI anxiety to perceived ease of use (p = 0.018{*}) and from perceived
ease of use to perceived usefulness (p = 0.002{*}{*}) are moderated by
gender. This study confirms the determinants influencing the behavioral
intention based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 of German
pre-service teachers to use AI-based applications in education.
Furthermore, the results demonstrate how essential it is to address
gender-specific aspects in teacher education because there is a high

integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer
offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its
variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take
into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to
receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain
in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers
despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most
commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which
may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular,
artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the
qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians,
including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of
the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic
phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact

teaching effects of art major courses, and then discussed the relevant
factors that affect the teaching effect of such courses. Next, the
potential improving effects of the AI on the teaching effect of art
major courses were expounded in details. On this basis, an evaluation

article,"Developing a gamified artificial intelligence educational robot to
promote learning effectiveness and behavior in laboratory safety courses
for undergraduate students","According to previous studies, traditional laboratory safety courses are
delivered in a classroom setting where the instructor teaches and the
students listen and read the course materials passively. The course
content is also uninspiring and dull. Additionally, the teaching period
is spread out, which adds to the instructor's workload. As a result,
students become less motivated to learn. In contrast, artificially
intelligent educational robots (AIERs), help students learn while
lessening the workload on instructors by enhancing teaching strategies,
using robots to substitute for teachers, giving students access to a
variety of instructional content, and improving interaction with
students through the use of intelligent voice interactions and Q\&A
systems to promote student engagement in learning. If the robot is used
for a long time for learning, it may lead to a decrease in students'
interest in learning. Therefore, this study introduces the GAFCC model
(the theory-driven gamification goal, access, feedback, challenge,
collaboration design model) as an instructional design model to guide
the development of a gamified AIER system, aiming to improve students'
motivation and learning effectiveness for laboratory safety courses. To
test the effectiveness of the system, this study conducted an
experimental study at a university in China in the summer of 2022. 53
participants participated in the research, with a random sample taken
from each group. Each participant was able to choose the time of their
free time to engage in the experiment. There were 18, 19, and 16
participants in experimental group 1, experimental group 2, and the
traditional group, respectively. Students in experimental group 1
learned using the gamified AIER system, students in experimental group 2
learned on a general anthropomorphic robot system and the control group
received traditional classroom learning. The experimental results showed
that compared to the other two groups, the gamified AIER system guided
by the GAFCC model significantly improved students' learning achievement
and enhanced their learning motivation, flow experience, and
problem-solving tendency. In addition, students who adopted this
approach exhibited more positive behaviors and reduced cognitive load in
the learning process.","Yang, Qi-Fan and Lian, Li-Wen and Zhao, Jia-Hua","Artificial intelligence education robot; Gamification; GAFCC model;

article,"Using a teacher scheme for educational dialogue analysis to investigate
student-student interaction patterns for optimal group activities in an
artificial intelligence course","Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI), seen as an engineering domain,
has been introduced into school education, but its pedagogy remains
unclear. In general, group learning has been applied as a primary form
of instruction in hands-on engineering activities. This learning
approach is more common in higher education. School students are less
mature; therefore, the benefits of adopting group learning as a
pedagogical approach remain unclear. Group learning quality can be
reflected by student-student interactions and dialogue within a group,
and is classified into four types: collective, cooperating-in-parallel,
dominant/defensive, and expert/novice. Accordingly, this experimental
study involved 37 middle school students, and explored how they
interacted within groups when learning AI through hands-on activities in
the four group learning types. The Teacher Scheme for Educational
Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA) was used to code student-student interactions
and compute their frequencies, and Lag Sequential Analysis was used to
analyze the behavioral interaction sequence characteristics of the four
group interaction patterns. The results showed that the expert/novice
group learning had higher frequency of interaction, and also produced
the longest, richest, and most complex sequences. The results suggest
that this is the optimal approach to learning for younger students in
hands-on AI activities as it encourages group members to interact with
each other and reach a consensus. The results contribute to the
literature by suggesting effective practices and confirming the use of
T-SEDA in a new engineering school subject.","Hu, Xiaoyong and He, Wei and Chiu, Thomas K. F. and Zhao, Li","Student-student interaction; Group interaction patterns; Educational

article,"Collaborative construction of artificial intelligence curriculum in
primary schools","Background: The recent discussion of introducing artificial intelligence
(AI) knowledge to K-12 students, like many engineering and technology
education topics, has attracted a wide range of stakeholders and
resources for school curriculum development. While teachers often have
to directly interact with external stakeholders out of the public
schooling system, few studies have scrutinized their negotiation
process, especially teachers' responses to external influences, in such
complex environments. Purpose: Guided by an integrated theoretical
framework of social constructionism, this research examined the process
of how a teacher-initiated AI curriculum was constructed with external
influences. The research focused on teachers' perspectives and responses
in mediating external influences into local schools and classrooms.
Methods: A 3-year ethnographic study was conducted in relation to an AI
curriculum project among 23 Computer Science (CS) teachers from primary
schools. Data collected from ethnographic observation, teacher
interviews, and artifacts, were analyzed using open coding and
triangulation rooted in the ethnographic, interpretivist approach.
Results: Three sets of external influences were found salient for
teachers' curriculum decisions, including the orientation of state-level
educational policies, AI faculty at a partner university, and students'
media and technology environments. The teachers' situational logics and
strategic actions were reconstructed with thick descriptions to uncover
how they navigated and negotiated the external influences to fulfill
local challenges and expectations in classrooms and schools.
Conclusions: The ethnographic study uncovered the dynamic and
multifaceted negotiation involved in the collaborative curriculum
development, and offers insights to inform policymaking, teacher
education, and student support in engineering education.","Dai, Yun and Liu, Ang and Qin, Jianjun and Guo, Yanmei and Jong, Morris

patient views on the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in
radiotherapy. The aim of this study is to adapt and utilise a validated
patient questionnaire to develop an understanding of current patient
views on the use of AI in radiotherapy. Materials/methods: An existing
questionnaire, developed to assess understanding of patients' views on
the implementation of AI in radiology, was adapted to the field of
radiotherapy. The questionnaire was distributed to cancer patients
receiving radiotherapy treatment between November 2021 and March 2022.
Completed questionnaires were analysed to assess patient levels of
positivity or negativity towards AI. Results were grouped into five
factors, representing underlying patient perspectives, and correlation
of factors with demographic variables was assessed. Results: In total,
95 patients participated. Overall, there was a moderately negative
patient view towards the use of AI in radiotherapy. Certain factors drew
a more negative response than others, for example patients desire
significant personal interaction with healthcare professionals during
the course of their treatment. No significant correlation was found
between the demographics of age and gender and the strength of views
towards the use of AI in radiotherapy. Conclusion: This study has found
that there are clear patient concerns around the use of AI in
radiotherapy. As the use of AI in this field increases in future years,
it will therefore be extremely important to educate and involve patients
in the future direction of this technology.

explore the chemical structure-biological activity relationship","The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial
intelligence (AI) systems in drug design. Neural networks, which are one
of the systems employed in AI, are used to identify chemical structures
that can have medical relevance. Successful training of neural networks
must be preceded by the acquisition of relevant information about
chemical compounds, functional groups, and their possible biological
activity. In general, a neural network requires a large set of training
data, which must contain information about the chemical
structure-biological activity relationship. The data can come from
experimental measurements, but can also be generated using appropriate
quantum models. In many of the studies presented below, authors showed a
significant potential of neural networks to produce generalizations
based on even relatively narrow training data. Despite the fact that
neural network systems have been known for more than 40 years, it is
only recently that they have seen rapid development due to the wider
availability of computing power. In recent years, there has been a
growing interest in deep learning techniques, bringing network modeling
to a new level of abstraction. Deep learning allows combining what seems

sufficient to bring about consistent excellent performance.
Specifically, rather than assuming outcome targets are consistently met,
in quality control, managers assume that wide variation is likely
present unless proven otherwise with objective performance data. In this
article, we discuss what we consider to be the eight essential elements

consistent quality in radiology: a process control framework,
performance measures, performance standards and targets, monitoring
applications, prediction models, optimization models, feedback
mechanisms, and accountability mechanisms. We consider these elements to

Artificial Intelligence: A Case Study of Cancer-Staging Data in Biology","It is essential to utilize deep-learning algorithms based on big data
for the implementation of the new generation of artificial intelligence.
Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number
of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in
an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an
approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a
deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into
a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set
to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set.
Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples.
Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the
effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small
sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the
approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small
labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed
approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This
research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical
machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a
deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use
of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application
scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on
deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This
research is also expected to contribute to the comprehensive promotion

article,"Artificial intelligence divulges effective tactics of top management
institutes of India","Purpose The performance analysis of top 50 management institutions of
India is conducted to understand their efficiency in utilizing available
resources. The importance of different indicators is investigated to
identify most preferred strategies of top management institutions in the
country in order to meet the expectations of all stakeholders.
Artificial neural networks models are applied for pattern recognition
and classification purpose using self-organized map algorithms. A huge
reservoir of young generation is being trained every year to meet the
demand of business in different sectors of economies. It becomes a
matter of concern to know the performance of the management institutes
to ensure the overall national progress, which can be done by enabling
organizations to improve their efficiency and effectiveness, provided
the right information and skills are served. Data envelopment analysis
(DEA) and self-organizing maps are utilized together to take advantages
of optimization and prediction capabilities inherent in each method, and
they may be beneficial to assess institution's competitive position and
design their own strategies in order to improve. The paper aims to
discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach The DEA is used to
understand the utilization of resources by institutions on the bases of
efficiency scores. Due to a greater flexibility and adaptability, neural
technique, i.e. self-organized map, which is an artificial
intelligence-based technique, a popular unsupervised learning model with
a capability to capture patterns from data sets, is used. In this study,
various parameters like qualification of faculty, research output of
faculty members, expenditure made for functioning of the institution,
etc., are considered. These academic and operational indicators are
investigated in relation to the rank score and the efficiency score of
top management institutions, and different strategies as a combination
of input as well as output indicators are identified. Findings In the
analysis, three types of strategies are identified. At present, the
focus on salary packages of graduates seems the most utilized strategy.
It is also observed that the strategy of having good performance, in
terms of consultancy, peer and employer perception, has the highest
success rate (in terms of score used for ranking). Results obtained
using both techniques shows that due to high deviation and less explored
research publications and sponsored research project is an opportunity
that institutions can work upon to have maximum output. But to maintain
consistency in terms of the high rank score and efficiency score,
management institutions need to focus on consultancy, peer and employer
perception. Practical implications - This research identifies the
different parameters categorized into various inputs and outputs for the
management institutions in India for the benchmarking. It studies the
importance of identified parameters in terms of success (rank score and
efficiency score). Further investigation of relationship between
parameters and success is conducted. Different strategies as a
combination of parameters are identified. The current choice of top
management institutions is revealed in terms of their preference and
effectiveness of strategy. This research also provides some insight
about long-term and short-term strategies, which may be beneficial to
education managers or decision makers.
Originality/value It is one of the rare papers in terms of performance
measurement through data envelopment method and identification of
strategy using artificial intelligence. This paper utilized a hybrid
methodology that integrates these two data analytic methods to capture

article,"Estimating Academic Success in Higher Education Using Big Five
Personality Traits, a Machine Learning Approach","The most popular way of predicting academic success in higher education
is to use students' existing course grades. In this study we propose a
novel approach to predict academic success in higher education with use
of personality traits rather than existing course grades. Our main focus
on this multidisciplinary study is to get the benefits of psychology and
computer science to predict academic success of students in higher
education, by using Machine Learning. We have used Big Five features as
the personality traits of 2,575 higher education students and tested our
proposed method on 20 different course categories. At the end of this
study we conclude that Machine Learning can be used for predicting
academic success while using all of the Big Five personality trait
dimensions. With our proposed method, Big Five traits of prospective
students can be used to predict higher education student success for the

article,"Prediction of Blast-Induced Ground Vibration at a Limestone Quarry: An
Artificial Intelligence Approach","Ground vibration is one of the most unfavourable environmental effects
of blasting activities, which can cause serious damage to neighboring
homes and structures. As a result, effective forecasting of their
severity is critical to controlling and reducing their recurrence. There
are several conventional vibration predictor equations available
proposed by different researchers but most of them are based on only two
parameters, i.e., explosive charge used per delay and distance between
blast face to the monitoring point. It is a well-known fact that
blasting results are influenced by a number of blast design parameters,
such as burden, spacing, powder factor, etc. but these are not being
considered in any of the available conventional predictors and due to
that they show a high error in predicting blast vibrations. Nowadays,
artificial intelligence has been widely used in blast engineering. Thus,
three artificial intelligence approaches, namely Gaussian process
regression (GPR), extreme learning machine (ELM) and backpropagation
neural network (BPNN) were used in this study to estimate ground
vibration caused by blasting in Shree Cement Ras Limestone Mine in
India. To achieve that aim, 101 blasting datasets with powder factor,
average depth, distance, spacing, burden, charge weight, and stemming
length as input parameters were collected from the mine site. For
comparison purposes, a simple multivariate regression analysis (MVRA)
model as well as, a nonparametric regression-based technique known as
multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) was also constructed
using the same datasets. This study serves as a foundational study for
the comparison of GPR, BPNN, ELM, MARS and MVRA to ascertain their
respective predictive performances. Eighty-one (81) datasets
representing 80\% of the total blasting datasets were used to construct
and train the various predictive models while 20 data samples (20\%)
were utilized for evaluating the predictive capabilities of the
developed predictive models. Using the testing datasets, major
indicators of performance, namely mean squared error (MSE), variance
accounted for (VAF), correlation coefficient (R) and coefficient of
determination (R-2) were compared as statistical evaluators of model
performance. This study revealed that the GPR model exhibited superior
predictive capability in comparison to the MARS, BPNN, ELM and MVRA. The
GPR model showed the highest VAF, R and R-2 values of 99.1728\%, 0.9985
and 0.9971 respectively and the lowest MSE of 0.0903. As a result, the
blast engineer can employ GPR as an effective and appropriate method for
forecasting blast-induced ground vibration.","Arthur, Clement Kweku and Bhatawdekar, Ramesh Murlidhar and Mohamad, Edy

article,"DeepMalaria: Artificial Intelligence Driven Discovery of Potent
Antiplasmodials","Antimalarial drugs are becoming less effective due to the emergence of
drug resistance. Resistance has been reported for all available malaria
drugs, including artemisinin, thus creating a perpetual need for
alternative drug candidates. The traditional drug discovery approach of
high throughput screening (HTS) of large compound libraries for
identification of new drug leads is time-consuming and resource
intensive. While virtual in silico screening is a solution to this
problem, however, the generalization of the models is not ideal.
Artificial intelligence (AI), utilizing either structure-based or
ligand-based approaches, has demonstrated highly accurate performances
in the field of chemical property prediction. Leveraging the existing
data, AI would be a suitable alternative to blind-search HTS or
fingerprint-based virtual screening. The AI model would learn patterns
within the data and help to search for hit compounds efficiently. In
this work, we introduce DeepMalaria, a deep-learning based process
capable of predicting the anti-Plasmodium falciparum inhibitory
properties of compounds using their SMILES. A graph-based model is
trained on 13,446 publicly available antiplasmodial hit compounds from
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) dataset that are currently being used to find
novel drug candidates for malaria. We validated this model by predicting
hit compounds from a macrocyclic compound library and already approved
drugs that are used for repurposing. We have chosen macrocyclic
compounds as these ligand-binding structures are underexplored in
malaria drug discovery. The in silico pipeline for this process also
consists of additional validation of an in-house independent dataset
consisting mostly of natural product compounds. Transfer learning from a
large dataset was leveraged to improve the performance of the deep
learning model. To validate the DeepMalaria generated hits, we used a
commonly used SYBR Green I fluorescence assay based phenotypic
screening. DeepMalaria was able to detect all the compounds with
nanomolar activity and 87.5\% of the compounds with greater than 50\%
inhibition. Further experiments to reveal the compounds' mechanism of
action have shown that not only does one of the hit compounds, DC-9237,
inhibits all asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum, but is a
fast-acting compound which makes it a strong candidate for further
optimization.","Arshadi, Arash Keshavarzi and Salem, Milad and Collins, Jennifer and

(CNNs) has a great potential to enhance medical workflow and improve
health care quality. Of particular interest is practical implementation
of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine,
the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic

Methods: In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular
degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs
to perform AMD diagnosis.
Results: Here, we present an AI-and cloud-based telemedicine interaction
tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning
process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence
tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same
image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our

capacity algorithm and artificial intelligence authentication","As a fundamental security problem, counterfeits pose a tremendous threat
to public health and social economy. Herein, we exploit multi-functional
nanoinks made of one-dimensional silicon-based nanohy-brids for
constructing fluorescent and plasmonic security tags. Of particular
significance, the presented security solution exhibits triple-layer
authentication model, simultaneously featuring the advantages of
physical unclonable functions (PUFs), huge-encoding capacity algorithm
and artificial intelligence technique. In macroscale, the multi-color
fluorescence security signals are used as the first layer, which can be
verified through portable smartphone. In the second security layer, the
unclonable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) security signals at
low-level magnification could be visualized using confocal Raman system.
Taking advantages of coarse grained and quaternary encrypting of signals
from Raman at each pixel, the encoding capacity reaches 6.43 x

with shape-specific information. By further applying specifically
artificial intelligence (AI), faint features of different SERS images
are extracted and trained, allowing 98-100\% of recognition accuracy

article,"Metabolic syndrome screening in adolescents: New scores AI\_METS based
on artificial intelligence techniques","Background and aims: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) definitions in
adolescents based on the percentiles of its components are rather
complicated to use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to
test the validity of artificial intelligence (AI)-based scores
(AI\_METS) that do not use these percentiles for MetS screening for
adolescents.Methods and results: This study included 1086 adolescents
aged 12 to 18. The cohort underwent anthropometric measurements and
blood tests. Mean blood pressure (MBP), and triglyceride glucose index
(TyG) were calculated. Explainable AI methods are used to extract the
learned function. Gini importance techniques were tested and used to
build new scores for the screening of MetS. IDF, Cook, De Ferranti,
Viner, and Weiss definitions of MetS were used to test the validity of
these scores.MetS prevalence was 0.4\%-4.7\% according to these
definitions. AI\_METS used age, waist circumference, MBP, and TyG index.
They offer area under the curves (AUCs) 0.91, 0.93, 0.89, 0.93, and
0.98; specificity 81\%, 75\%, 72\%, 80\%, and 97\%; and sensitivity
90\%, 100\%, 90\%, 100\%, and 100\%, respectively, for the detection of
MetS according to these definitions. Considering only MBP offers a
better specificity and sensitivity to detect MetS than considering only
TyG index. MBP offers slightly lower performance than
AI\_METS.Conclusion: AI techniques have proven their ability to extract
knowledge from data. They allowed us to generate new scores for MetS
detection in adolescents without using specific percentiles for each
component. Although these scores are less intuitive than the
percentile-based definition, their accuracy is rather effective for the
detection of MetS.(c) 2022 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian

gamification becomes a fairly effective IT tool that contributes to

article,Artificial Intelligence for Skin Cancer Detection: Scoping Review,"Background: Skin cancer is the most common cancer type affecting humans.
Traditional skin cancer diagnosis methods are costly, require a
professional physician, and take time. Hence, to aid in diagnosing skin
cancer, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being used, including
shallow and deep machine learning-based methodologies that are trained
to detect and classify skin cancer using computer algorithms and deep
neural networks.
Objective: The aim of this study was to identify and group the different
types of AI-based technologies used to detect and classify skin cancer.
The study also examined the reliability of the selected papers by
studying the correlation between the data set size and the number of
diagnostic classes with the performance metrics used to evaluate the
models.
Methods: We conducted a systematic search for papers using Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, Association for
Computing Machinery Digital Library (ACM DL), and Ovid MEDLINE databases
following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The
studies included in this scoping review had to fulfill several selection
criteria: being specifically about skin cancer, detecting or classifying
skin cancer, and using AI technologies. Study selection and data
extraction were independently conducted by two reviewers. Extracted data
were narratively synthesized, where studies were grouped based on the
diagnostic AI techniques and their evaluation metrics.
Results: We retrieved 906 papers from the 3 databases, of which 53 were
eligible for this review. Shallow AI-based techniques were used in 14
studies, and deep AI-based techniques were used in 39 studies. The
studies used up to 11 evaluation metrics to assess the proposed models,
where 39 studies used accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
Overall, studies that used smaller data sets reported higher accuracy.
Conclusions: This paper examined multiple AI-based skin cancer detection
models. However, a direct comparison between methods was hindered by the
varied use of different evaluation metrics and image types. Performance
scores were affected by factors such as data set size, number of
diagnostic classes, and techniques. Hence, the reliability of shallow
and deep models with higher accuracy scores was questionable since they
were trained and tested on relatively small data sets of a few
diagnostic classes.","Takiddin, Abdulrahman and Schneider, Jens and Yang, Yin and Abd-Alrazaq,

problems","With the continuous development of society, people's life pressure is
constantly increasing, and the mental health problems of college
students are becoming increasingly prominent, bringing many challenges
to their education and management. Universities should not only
cultivate students' theoretical and professional knowledge and practical
skills, but also attach importance to their mental health and
effectively implement psychological education. Therefore, it is very
necessary to develop and design a simple and effective student
psychological evaluation system. As a new form of ideological and
political transformation in universities in the era of big data, online
ideological and political work has potential development space. It is
necessary to carry out mental health education in universities, fully
utilize online education forms, and improve ability of universities to
repair mental health problems. Based on this, this system designs and
implements software for typical image resolution based recognition and
artificial intelligence. The use of B/S architecture in the development
and use of. net technology and web server technology will enable more
students to connect and use different terminals. In addition, an
algorithm for image super-resolution recognition was proposed, which
uses clustering convolution to improve residual blocks, improves
modeling ability by extracting features on a larger scale, reduces the
number of parameters to improve model calculation efficiency, and
enables mental health educators and managers to work better. This

Intelligence Ethics","Students are the backbone of national development and progress, and
should stand at the forefront of the era of innovation and
entrepreneurship. Cultivating the entrepreneurship of college students
is not only a response to the national call, but also a basic
requirement for implementing quality education and promoting the
comprehensive development of college students. To better study the
entrepreneurship of college students, cultivate a group of newcomers of
the era who have patriotic feelings, dare to innovate, hardworking and
sustainable struggle, and solve the problem of college students'
employment difficulties from the root, the cultivation mode of college
students' entrepreneurship is studied. Firstly, the impact of artificial
intelligence (AI) technology on social ethics is analyzed. Secondly, it
analyzes the current situation of the cultivation of science and
engineering college students' entrepreneurship from three aspects:
Chinese traditional cultural thoughts influence the concept of career
choice, enterprises emphasize utilitarianism, and colleges and
universities attach importance to knowledge education and despise
spiritual education. Finally, the data statistics on the cultivation of
entrepreneurship of science and engineering college students are carried
out in the form of questionnaires. The results demonstrate that among
the students surveyed, 21.31\% have a strong willingness to start their
own business, and 72.84\% have the idea of starting their own business,
which means that most students still want to start a business through
their own efforts, not blindly looking for jobs. Simultaneously, among
many majors, 87.5\% of students majoring in agriculture and medicine are
better at finding new ways to solve problems, while the proportion of
students majoring in literature and history is the lowest. It also
indicates that most students believe that schools should add more
seminar courses, internship courses, design courses, experimental
courses, etc., and allow students to choose learning courses across
colleges and majors, to cultivate college students' entrepreneurship.

Materials and methods The study was conducted in strict compliance with

(PRISMA) statement. Literature databases were searched for articles
describing the development and validation of AI models aimed at
diagnosing knee or hip joint pathologies or predicting their development
or course in patients. The quality of the included articles was assessed
using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)

Results 56 articles were found that meet all the inclusion criteria. We
identified two problems that block the full integration of AI into the
routine of an orthopaedic physician. The first of them is related to the
insufficient amount, variety and quality of data for training, and
validation and testing of AI models. The second problem is the rarity of
rational evaluation of models, which is why their real quality cannot
always be evaluated.
Conclusion The vastness and relevance of the studied topic are beyond
doubt. Qualitative and optimally validated models exist in all four
scopes considered. Additional optimization and confirmation of the
models' quality on various datasets are the last technical stumbling

evaluation of teaching (SET) using artificial intelligence (AI). We
train natural language processing (NLP) models on 1.6 million student

The trained NLP models exhibited high prediction accuracy, and they
learnt two biases from humans, those of extreme responding and assigning
higher ratings to less demanding courses. In the future, universities
will likely adopt many AI-based tools that have proved successful in
client management in other sectors. However, our results make a strong

were published from January to May 2020 were analysed. A constructivist
grounded theory approach driven by a data coding process and qualitative
analysis was adopted to identify underlying concepts for constructing
appropriate responses. First-level coding identified substantive codes
that were converted into broader abstract concepts, while a word-tree
analysis identified the core theme. A series of codes were classified
into reduced final concepts and dimensions using NVivo 12. Finally, a
binary similarity index (Jaccard's coefficients) was used to calculate
the similarities between any two sets of substantive concepts. The
results revealed three driving forces determining post-COVID-19 retail
business survival and sustainability: quality, omni-channel retailing,
and accountable management. The demand for flexible and blended forms of
life-long learning will require employee up-skilling and re-skilling,
and has increased the demand for short-term online courses. The future
of retail businesses will depend more on science and technology that

MethodsThe scoping review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for
scoping reviews using Medline-OVID, EMBASE, CINAHL, and IEEE, with a
double screening and extraction process. The search included articles
published until February 28, 2020. Articles were excluded if they did
not self-classify as studying an AI intervention, were not relevant to
the emergency department (ED), or did not report outcomes or evaluation.
ResultsOf the 1483 original database citations, 395 were eligible for
full-text evaluation. Of these articles, a total of 150 were included in
the scoping review. The majority of included studies were retrospective
in nature (n = 124, 82.7\%), with only 3 (2.0\%) prospective controlled
trials. We found 37 (24.7\%) interventions aimed at improving diagnosis
within the ED. Among the 150 studies, 19 (12.7\%) focused on diagnostic

infectious diseases worldwide. Early screening and diagnosis of
pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is crucial in TB control, and tend to

platform to identify trials published update to November 2022 that
evaluated the effectiveness of artificial-intelligence-based software in
medical imaging of patients with PTB. After data extraction, the quality
of studies was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy

using a bivariate random-effects model. In total, 3987 references were
initially identified and 61 studies were finally included, covering a
wide range of 124,959 individuals. The pooled sensitivity and the

development of AI technology. In this review, we will describe and
discuss the progress of AI technology in SPECT imaging. The applications
of AI are dispersed in disease prediction and diagnosis,
post-reconstruction image denoising, attenuation map generation, and

current SPECT studies. For each application, we followed the timeline to
present the evolution of AI's usage and offered insights on how AI was
combined with the knowledge of underlying physics as well as traditional
non-learning techniques. Ultimately, AI applications are critical to the
progress of modern SPECT technology because they provide compensations
for many deficiencies in conventional SPECT imaging methods and
demonstrate unparalleled success. Nonetheless, AI also has its own

article,"Artificial Intelligence May Cause a Significant Disruption to the
Radiology Workforce","The increasingly realistic prospect of artificial intelligence (AI)
playing an important role in radiology has been welcomed with a mixture
of enthusiasm and anxiousness. A consensus has arisen that AI will
support radiologists in the interpretation of less challenging cases,
which will give the radiologists more time to focus on the challenging
tasks as well as interactions with patients and other clinicians. The
possibility of AI replacing a large number of radiologists is generally
dismissed by the radiology community. The common arguments include the
following: (1) AI will never be able to match radiologists' performance;
(2) radiologists do more than interpret images; (3) even if AI takes
over a large portion of the reading tasks, the radiologists' effort will
be shifted toward interactions with patients and other physicians; (4)
the FDA would never agree to let machines do the work of radiologist;
(5) the issues of legal liability would be insurmountable; and (6)
patients would never put complete trust in computer algorithms. In this
article, I analyze these arguments in detail. I find a certain level of
validity to some of them. However, I conclude that none of the arguments
provide sufficient support for the claim that AI will not create a
significant disruption in the radiology workforce. Such disruption is a
real possibility. Although the radiology specialty has shown an
astonishing ability to adapt to the changing technology, the future is

artificial intelligence: An online survey","ObjectivesThis study investigated Korean dental hygiene students'
perceptions and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and aimed
to identify needs for education to strengthen professional competencies.
MethodsA 24-question online survey was conducted to the dental hygiene
students from four Korean schools in 2021. The questionnaire included
seven questions on basic characteristics and 17 AI-related questions on
the student's attitudes toward AI, the confidence in AI, predictions
about AI, and its future prospects. Responses were analyzed according to
the frequencies and correlations between the participants' subjective
level of knowledge about AI and questions using chi-square test.
ResultsInvitations were sent out to 1310 students and 800 (61.1\%)
participated. Note that 44.2\% of participants were interested in AI,
and 93.1\% accessed AI-related information through the internet.
Participants expressed lower confidence in AI's diagnosis (14.8\%) and

Macroeconomic Assessment in Asia-Pacific Region","Objective: To determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on
the selected economies in the Asia-Pacific region. Methods: This
secondary research collected data from macroeconomic and AI-specific
data sets. The sources of data from which insights were gained included
digital technology sectors and corporations and their functions. The
focus was on the need to assess the capability of AI on business
operations The macroeconomic data was collected from data resources of
international organizations' including the World Economic Forum, the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU). In addition, this study has considered 19
economic indicators to analyze the economic outcome of AI in selected
economies of Asia-Pacific. Results: From the results, the period between
2014 and 2016 witnessed China leading with over 25,000 citable documents
on the AI topic. Regarding institutions that were observed to publish
over 500 times on the AI topic, the countries in the ascending order
include China (600), Hong Kong (1,100), and Singapore (2,000). As such,
this study established that Asia-Pacific economies such as Hong Kong and
Singapore though have smaller populations, but the majority of their
higher education institutions have made a significant contribution to AI
research; with the small economies also having a relatively higher
number of computer scientists among the top 1,000 individuals.
Additionally, through empirically analyses, during 1998-2016 with annual
observations, it is found that various economic outcomes of AI were
presented in 8 economies of targeted region. Limitations: At first, the
future outlook of AI is just discussed in conceptual meaning while
empirical context still needs to be examined in upcoming studies. At
second, covering the overall South Asian region provides better findings
with more generalization which is missing in current research. At third,
other dimensions of AI and economy like implication of AI impact index
and its relationship with macroeconomic variables is also missing in
current research which could be reconsidered in coming studies.
Conclusion: It is evident that AI exhibits the potential to be the main
driver of Asia-Pacific's economic growth. Relative to the net and gross
effect of AI on labor markets and the gross domestic product (GDP) of
the top Asia-Pacific economies demonstrate that by 2030, AI might yield
a 16-percent increase in output, translating into an estimated amount of
\$13 trillion. Overall, it is concluded that Asia-Pacific, when compared
to developed regions such as North America, is lagging but the
availability of a large pool of user data implies that the region can
move ahead-given better resource and talent allocation. (C) 2019 The

pandemic. This study aimed to develop an efficient deep-learning
artificial intelligence algorithm to identify top clinical variable
predictors and derive a risk stratification score system to help
clinicians triage COVID-19 patients.
MethodsThis retrospective study consisted of 181 hospitalized patients
with confirmed COVID-19 infection from January 29, 2020 to March 21,
2020 from a major hospital in Wuhan, China. The primary outcome was
mortality. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms, and
laboratory tests were collected at initial presentation, totaling 78
clinical variables. A deep-learning algorithm and a risk stratification
score system were developed to predict mortality. Data were split into
85\% training and 15\% testing. Prediction performance was compared with
those using COVID-19 severity score, CURB-65 score, and pneumonia
severity index (PSI).
ResultsOf the 181 COVID-19 patients, 39 expired and 142 survived. Five
top predictors of mortality were D-dimer, O-2 Index,
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, and lactate
dehydrogenase. The top 5 predictors and the resultant risk score
yielded, respectively, an area under curve (AUC) of 0.968 (95\% CI =
0.87-1.0) and 0.954 (95\% CI = 0.80-0.99) for the testing dataset. Our
models outperformed COVID-19 severity score (AUC = 0.756), CURB-65 score
(AUC = 0.671), and PSI (AUC = 0.838). The mortality rates for our risk
stratification scores (0-5) were 0\%, 0\%, 6.7\%, 18.2\%, 67.7\%, and
83.3\%, respectively.
ConclusionsDeep-learning prediction model and the resultant risk
stratification score may prove useful in clinical decisionmaking under
time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.","Zhu, Jocelyn S. and Ge, Peilin and Jiang, Chunguo and Zhang, Yong and

article,"Artificial intelligence in dentistry: Harnessing big data to predict
oral cancer survival","BACKGROUND
Oral cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Public
knowledge in oral cancer risk factors and survival is limited.
AIM
To come up with machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the length
of survival for individuals diagnosed with oral cancer, and to explore
the most important factors that were responsible for shortening or
lengthening oral cancer survival.
METHODS
We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from
the years 1975 to 2016 that consisted of a total of 257880 cases and 94
variables. Four ML techniques in the area of artificial intelligence
were applied for model training and validation. Model accuracy was
evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE),
root mean squared error (RMSE), R-2 and adjusted R-2.
RESULTS
The most important factors predictive of oral cancer survival time were
age at diagnosis, primary cancer site, tumor size and year of diagnosis.
Year of diagnosis referred to the year when the tumor was first
diagnosed, implying that individuals with tumors that were diagnosed in
the modern era tend to have longer survival than those diagnosed in the
past. The extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms showed the best
performance, with the MAE equaled to 13.55, MSE 486.55 and RMSE 22.06.
CONCLUSION
Using artificial intelligence, we developed a tool that can be used for
oral cancer survival prediction and for medical-decision making. The
finding relating to the year of diagnosis represented an important new
discovery in the literature. The results of this study have implications
for cancer prevention and education for the public.","Hung, Man and Park, Jungweon and Hon, Eric S. and Bounsanga, Jerry and

Air Pollution Monitoring","The main aims of urban air pollution monitoring are to optimize the
interaction between humanity and nature, to combine and integrate
environmental databases, and to develop sustainable approaches to the
production and the organization of the urban environment. One of the
main applications of urban air pollution monitoring is for exposure
assessment and public health studies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) approaches can be used to build air pollution
models to predict pollutant concentrations and assess environmental and
health risks. Air pollution data can be uploaded into AI/ML models to
estimate different exposure levels within different communities. The
correlation between exposure estimates and public health surveys is
important for assessing health risks. These aspects are critical when it
concerns environmental injustice. Computational approaches should
efficiently manage, visualize, and integrate large datasets. Effective
data integration and management are a key to the successful application
of computational intelligence approaches in ecology. In this paper, we
consider some of these constraints and discuss possible ways to overcome
current problems and environmental injustice. The most successful global
approach is the development of the smart city; however, such an approach
can only increase environmental injustice as not all the regions have
access to AI/ML technologies. It is challenging to develop successful
regional projects for the analysis of environmental data in the current

Potential Future Use","Objectives: With much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) rendering
radiologists redundant, a simple radiologist-augmented AI workflow is
evaluated; the premise is that inclusion of a radiologist's opinion into
an AI algorithm would make the algorithm achieve better accuracy than an
algorithm trained on imaging parameters alone. Open-source BI-RADS data
sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist's opinion
(in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters
improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine
learning algorithms vis-a-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.
Materials and Methods: BI-RADS data sets were obtained from the
University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set
1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data
set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold
cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion
shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture
parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters
and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under
the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the
validation data set.
Results: The models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS
classification performed significantly better than the models not using
them (P < .0001).
Conclusion: AI and radiologist working together can achieve better
results, helping in case-based decision making. Further evaluation of

article,"Artificial Intelligence-Based Chatbot for Anxiety and Depression in
University Students: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are emerging as
instruments of psychological intervention; however, no relevant studies
have been reported in Latin America.
Objective: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the
viability, acceptability, and potential impact of using Tess, a chatbot,
for examining symptoms of depression and anxiety in university students.
Methods: This was a pilot randomized controlled trial. The experimental
condition used Tess for 8 weeks, and the control condition was assigned
to a psychoeducation book on depression. Comparisons were conducted
using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests for depressive symptoms, and
independent and paired sample t tests to analyze anxiety symptoms.
Results: The initial sample consisted of 181 Argentinian college
students (158, 87.2\% female) aged 18 to 33. Data at week 8 were
provided by 39 out of the 99 (39\%) participants in the experimental
condition and 34 out of the 82 (41\%) in the control group. On an
average, 472 (SD 249.52) messages were exchanged, with 116 (SD 73.87) of
the messages sent from the users in response to Tess. A higher number of
messages exchanged with Tess was associated with positive feedback
(F-2,(36)=4.37; P=.02). No significant differences between the
experimental and control groups were found from the baseline to week 8
for depressive and anxiety symptoms. However, significant intragroup
differences demonstrated that the experimental group showed a
significant decrease in anxiety symptoms; no such differences were
observed for the control group. Further, no significant intragroup
differences were found for depressive symptoms.
Conclusions: The students spent a considerable amount of time exchanging
messages with Tess and positive feedback was associated with a higher
number of messages exchanged. The initial results show promising
evidence for the usability and acceptability of Tess in the Argentinian
population. Research on chatbots is still in its initial stages and

diagnostic modality for polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (GB), but is
limited by subjective interpretation. Deep learning-based artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms are under development. We evaluated the
diagnostic performance of AI in differentiating polypoid lesions using
EUS images. Methods The diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI system with
ResNet50 architecture was evaluated via three processes: training,
internal validation, and testing using an AI development cohort of 1039
EUS images (836 GB polyps and 203 gallstones). The diagnostic
performance was verified using an external validation cohort of 83
patients and compared with the performance of EUS endoscopists. Results
In the AI development cohort, we developed an EUS-AI algorithm and
evaluated the diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI including
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive
value, and accuracy. For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and
non-neoplastic GB polyps, these values for EUS-AI were 57.9\%, 96.5\%,
77.8\%, 91.6\%, and 89.8\%, respectively. In the external validation
cohort, we compared diagnostic performances between EUS-AI and
endoscopists. For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and
non-neoplastic GB polyps, the sensitivity and specificity were 33.3\%
and 96.1\% for EUS-AI; they were 74.2\% and 44.9\%, respectively, for
the endoscopists. Besides, the accuracy of the EUS-AI was between the
accuracies of mid-level (66.7\%) and expert EUS endoscopists (77.5\%).

government and schools encourage college students to start businesses to
alleviate employment pressure. College student's successful
entrepreneurship depends on national preferential policies, social
support, and, most importantly, their healthy and solid psychological
quality and entrepreneurial psychological quality. The purpose is to
understand the entrepreneurial psychology of college students and study
the entrepreneurial psychological effect. Firstly, the four aspects of
entrepreneurial psychology are summarized, including entrepreneurial
awareness, entrepreneurial volition, entrepreneurial ability, and
entrepreneurial personality. Secondly, the research status of college
students' entrepreneurial psychology is reviewed, and the existing
problems are pointed out. Thirdly, the combined model of wavelet
transform and Neural Network (NN) is proposed, and the feasibility of
the proposed model is evaluated through the analysis of college
students' entrepreneurial psychology. The wavelet NN is used in
experimental design to predict college students' entrepreneurial
psychology, and the predicted results are compared with the actual
value. From the perspective of the prediction results of entrepreneurial
psychology, the combination of wavelet algorithm and neural network is
more accurate for entrepreneurial psychology prediction and evaluation
results of law students. Overall, the difference between the predicted
value and the actual value is within 0.3 points, which is relatively
stable. According to the analysis of single-factor results, the scores
of students of different majors in the four dimensions of
entrepreneurial psychology are all higher than 3.5, but there is no
significant difference among the four dimensions (P > 0.05), indicating
that the major has no significant impact on entrepreneurial psychology;
law students with different educational backgrounds have significant
differences in entrepreneurial psychology (P < 0.05), among which
students with a master's degree have the strongest entrepreneurial will,
while doctoral students have the lowest entrepreneurial will; in terms
of entrepreneurial psychological capital, men's self-efficacy is higher
than women's, and the difference is significant (P < 0.05). The
difference between males and females in the scores of entrepreneurial
psychological factors' four aspects is not very obvious. In terms of
entrepreneurial psychological capital, males' self-efficacy is
significantly higher than females' (P < 0.05). Artificial Intelligence

the level of detail included in early AI research reporting has been
highly variable and inconsistent, particularly when compared to more
traditional clinical research. However, inclusion checklists are now
commonly available and accessible to those writing or reviewing clinical

offering solutions to time-consuming tasks, thereby improving workflow
efficiency and democratizing access to specialist opinion. As a result,
pediatric radiologists are expected to be increasingly leading and
contributing to AI imaging research, and researchers and clinicians
alike should feel confident that the findings reported are presented in
a transparent way, with sufficient detail to understand how they apply
to wider clinical practice. In this review, we describe two of the most

article,"Performance of artificial intelligence for detection of subtle and
advanced colorectal neoplasia","Objectives There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of artificial
intelligence (AI) software to detect advanced subtle neoplasia,
particularly flat lesions and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), due to
low prevalence in testing datasets and prospective trials. This has been
highlighted as a top research priority for the field. Methods An AI
algorithm was evaluated on four video test datasets containing 173
polyps (35,114 polyp-positive frames and 634,988 polyp-negative frames)
specifically enriched with flat lesions and SSLs, including a
challenging dataset containing subtle advanced neoplasia. The
challenging dataset was also evaluated by eight endoscopists (four
independent, four trainees, according to the Joint Advisory Group on
gastrointestinal endoscopy {[}JAG] standards in the UK). Results In the
first two video datasets, the algorithm achieved per-polyp sensitivities
of 100\% and 98.9\%. Per-frame sensitivities were 84.1\% and 85.2\%. In
the subtle dataset, the algorithm detected a significantly higher number
of polyps (P < 0.0001), compared to JAG-independent and trainee
endoscopists, achieving per-polyp sensitivities of 79.5\%, 37.2\% and
11.5\%, respectively. Furthermore, when considering subtle polyps
detected by both the algorithm and at least one endoscopist, the AI
detected polyps significantly faster on average. Conclusions The AI
based algorithm achieved high per-polyp sensitivities for advanced
colorectal neoplasia, including flat lesions and SSLs, outperforming
both JAG independent and trainees on a very challenging dataset
containing subtle lesions that could have been overlooked easily and
contribute to interval colorectal cancer. Further prospective trials

Technological Trajectories for Artificial Intelligence Education","Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine
learning techniques have shown the potential of AI-driven and
data-driven approaches in a large number of computing fields. Machine
learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher
education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it
in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the
context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as
schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional
computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into
school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine
learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing
education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and
AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research
body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn
to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is
especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the
emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology
related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
situates the existing work in the context of computing education in
general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators
should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses
on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to
successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing

article,"Improving detection of obstructive coronary artery disease with an
artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram algorithm","Background and aims: To evaluate the risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD), the traditional approach involves assessing the patient's
symptoms, traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and a 12-lead
electrocardiogram (ECG). However, currently, there are no established
criteria for interpreting an ECG to diagnose CAD. Therefore, we sought
to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG model to assist
in identifying patients with CAD. Methods: In this study, we included
patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) at a single center
between 2017 and 2019. Preprocedural 12-lead ECG performed within 24 h
was obtained. Obstructive CAD was defined as \& GE; 50\% diameter
stenosis. Using age, gender and ECG data, we developed stacking models
using both deep learning and machine learning. Then we compared the
performance of our models with CVRFs and with cardiologists' ECG
interpretation. Additionally, we validated our model on an external
cohort from a different hospital. Results: We included 4951 patients
with a mean age of 65.5 \& PLUSMN; 12.5 years, of whom 67.0\% were men.
Based on CAG, obstructive CAD was confirmed in 2637 patients (53.2\%).
Our best AI model demonstrated comparable performance to CVRFs in
predicting CAD, with an AUC of 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.75) compared to
0.71 (95\% CI: 0.66-0.76). The sensitivity and specificity of the AI
model were 0.75 and 0.54, respectively, while those of CVRFs were 0.67
and 0.63. Compared to cardiologists, the AI model showed better
performance with an F1 score of 0.68 vs 0.41. The external validation
showed generally consistent diagnostic findings, although there was a
slightly lower level of agreement observed in the external cohort.
Incorporating ECG and CVRFs improved the AUC to 0.72. Conclusions: Our
study suggests that an AI-enabled ECG model can assist in identifying
patients with obstructive CAD, with diagnostic performance similar to
that of the traditional approach based on CVRFs. This model could serve
as a useful clinical tool in an outpatient setting to identify patients
who require further diagnostic tests.","Lee, Yin-Hao and Hsieh, Ming-Tsung and Chang, Chun-Chin and Tsai, Yi-Lin

challenge was organized by the French Society of Radiology with the aim
to: (i), work on relevant public health issues; (ii), build large,
multicentre, high quality databases; and (iii), include
three-dimensional (3D) information and prognostic questions.
Materials and methods: Relevant clinical questions were proposed by
French subspecialty colleges of radiology. Their feasibility was
assessed by experts in the field of AI. A dedicated platform was set up
for inclusion centers to safely upload their anonymized examinations in
compliance with general data protection regulation. The quality of the
database was checked by experts weekly with annotations performed by
radiologists. Multidisciplinary teams competed between September 11th
and October 13th 2019.
Results: Three questions were selected using different imaging and
evaluation modalities, including: pulmonary nodule detection and
classification from 3D computed tomography (CT), prediction of expanded
disability status scale in multiple sclerosis using 3D magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and segmentation of muscular surface for
sarcopenia estimation from two-dimensional CT. A total of 4347
examinations were gathered of which only 6\% were excluded. Three
independent databases from 24 individual centers were created. A total
of 143 participants were split into 20 multidisciplinary teams.
Conclusion: Three data challenges with over 1200 general data protection
regulation compliant CT or MRI examinations each were organized. Future
challenges should be made with more complex situations combining
histopathological or genetic information to resemble real life
situations faced by radiologists in routine practice. (C) 2020 Societe

increasingly adopted in medical imaging and radiotherapy clinical
practice, however research, education and partnerships have not really
caught up yet to facilitate a safe and effective transition. The aim of
the document is to provide baseline guidance for radiographers working
in the field of AI in education, research, clinical practice and
stakeholder partnerships. The guideline is intended for use by the
multi-professional clinical imaging and radiotherapy teams, including
all staff, volunteers, students and learners.
Methods: The format mirrored similar publications from other SCoR
working groups in the past. The recommendations have been subject to a
rapid period of peer, professional and patient assessment and review.
Feedback was sought from a range of SoR members and advisory groups, as
well as from the SoR director of professional policy, as well as from
external experts. Amendments were then made in line with feedback
received and a final consensus was reached.
Results: AI is an innovative tool radiographers will need to engage with
to ensure a safe and efficient clinical service in imaging and
radiotherapy. Educational provisions will need to be proportionately
adjusted by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer the necessary
knowledge, skills and competences for diagnostic and therapeutic
radiographers, to enable them to navigate a future where AI will be
central to patient diagnosis and treatment pathways. Radiography-led
research in AI should address key clinical challenges and enable
radiographers co-design, implement and validate AI solutions.
Partnerships are key in ensuring the contribution of radiographers is
integrated into healthcare AI ecosystems for the benefit of the patients
and service users.
Conclusion: Radiography is starting to work towards a future with
AI-enabled healthcare. This guidance offers some recommendations for
different areas of radiography practice. There is a need to update our
educational curricula, rethink our research priorities, forge new strong
clinical-academic-industry partnerships to optimise clinical practice.
Specific recommendations in relation to clinical practice, education,

article,"Factors affecting students' preparedness for the fourth industrial
revolution in higher education institutions","Purpose - Knowing the students' readiness for the fourth industrial
revolution (4IR) is essential to producing competent, knowledgeable and
skilled graduates who can contribute to the skilled workforce in the
country. This will assist the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to
ensure that their graduates own skill sets needed to work in the 4IR
era. However, studies on students' readiness and preparedness for the
4IR in developing countries such as the Sultanate of Oman are still
lacking. Therefore, this study investigates students' readiness level
and preparedness for the 4IR. The findings of this study will benefit
the HEIs policymakers, administration, faculties, departments,
industries and society at large since they will be informed of the
student's readiness and preparedness toward industry 4.0.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted the measures from the
same context as previous studies in this study. The questionnaire was
divided into three sections; the first part described the purpose and
introduction of the search with the surety to keep the data
confidential. The second part consisted of demographical information
like gender, education. The last parts consisted of four subsections,
question items in these parts are based on the related previous study.
Characteristics consisted of 14 items, knowledge consisted of 18 items
related to 4IR technologies, Organizational Dimension comprised of four
items related to academic programs, curriculum and training.
Preparedness contained two items. The participants have rated all the
items in 5-Likert scale.
Findings - Results from structural equation modeling showed that
students' characteristics, knowledge of 4IR technologies and
organizational dimensions significantly impact their preparedness for
the 4IR. The study also found that organizational dimensions have the
highest impact on students' preparedness. Furthermore, the
organizational dimension significantly influences students' knowledge of
4IR technology. Moreover, students' characteristics related to 4IR are
significantly affected by their knowledge of 4IR technology and
organizational dimension. The findings suggest that HEIs are responsible
for increasing the adoption of 4IR, and therefore organizational
dimensions such as the academic programs, training, technological
infrastructure and others are all critical for preparing students for a
better future and should be given a priority.
Research limitations/implications - This study has used academic
programs and training to measure the organizational dimension. However,
other important factors should be considered, such as technological
infrastructure and leadership and governance of HEIs. Second, the
current research depends on quantitative data, so future research should
implement a mixed methodology (questionnaires, depth interviews,
document analysis and focus group) to understand the factors affecting
students' readiness for 4IR clearly. Finally, although the 4IR has
numerous benefits, it also has challenges in its implementation, so
future studies should focus on challenges encountered by different
stakeholders in implementing 4IRrelated technologies.
Practical implications - The curriculum must include mandatory courses
related to IT infrastructure design, user experience programming,
electronic measurement and control principles, and programming for data
science. HEIs should also foster interdisciplinary knowledge by
integrating IT, Engineering, Business and Sciences. Furthermore, the
HEIs should develop their infrastructure to have smart campuses, labs,
classrooms and libraries to make HEIs a space where knowledge can be
generated and innovative solutions can be proposed. This entails HEIs
offering necessary hardware, software and technical support because if
the HEIs improve their technological resources, students will be capable
of using 4IR-related technologies effectively.
Originality/value - The advancement of technology has resulted in the
emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial
intelligence, blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, data science,
virtual reality and 3D printing. It is essential to investigate
students' readiness for 4IR. However, there is no study as per
researchers' knowledge talked about students readiness in HEIs in the
Arab world. This study could be a basis for more research on students'
perception of the 4IR covering students from various backgrounds and
levels.","Al-Maskari, Azzah and Al Riyami, Thuraya and Ghnimi, Sami","Framework; Fourth industrial revolution; Readiness; Higher education

applied include support vector machine and artificial neural network.
Both AI methods were optimised by GSA to enhance the accuracy of the
results. Feature selections using stepwise regression and robust
regression were applied to utilise only significant gases. The accuracy
of the results was tested with various ratios of testing and training
data. Comparison of the results using the proposed method with other
optimisation methods and the previous works was performed to validate
the performance of the proposed technique. It was observed that the
proposed hybrid feature selection-AI-GSA technique yields reasonable
accuracy although fewer types of dissolved gases were used. Therefore,
the proposed method can be recommended for the application of automated
power transformer fault type detection based on DGA data in practice.","Illias, Hazlee Azil and Chan, Kai Choon and Mokhlis, Hazlie","regression analysis; learning (artificial intelligence); neural nets;

article,"Construction and Application of iWrite Artificial Intelligence
Evaluation System for College English Writing","The traditional English writing evaluation is an artificial way to
judge, which is a relatively subjective evaluation method. Also, the
artificial method has the defects of low timeliness and high error rate,
which limits the interest of college students in English learning. If
the content of college students' English writing cannot be judged, it
also limits their understanding of the correctness of the English
language, because English writing can reflect problems such as English
grammar, sentence structure, and emotional expression. Artificial
intelligence (AI) technology has developed rapidly, and it can
efficiently process the data of research objects. If artificial
intelligence technology is combined with English writing evaluation, it
can improve the timeliness and error rate of college students' English
evaluation. This is also an innovative way of judging college students'
English writing. Combining the characteristics of great learning English
writing and judging criteria, this research uses artificial intelligence
technology to design an efficient judging platform. It needs to use a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM)
neural network to extract features of grammar, sentence patterns, and
emotional expressions of college students' English writing. The research
results show that CNN and LSTM methods have high feasibility and
accuracy in extracting grammar, sentence patterns, and emotional
expressions of college students' English writing. The prediction error
of the college students' English writing evaluation system is also
within a reasonable range. CNN and LSTM methods have high accuracy in
predicting English rectangle, grammar, and emotional expression, and the
largest prediction error is only 2.91\%. Also, the three prediction

Intelligence in Surgery: Protocol for a Delphi Study","Background: The rapid uptake of digital technology into the operating
room has the potential to improve patient outcomes, increase efficiency
of the use of operating rooms, and allow surgeons to progress quickly up
learning curves. These technologies are, however, dependent on huge
amounts of data, and the consequences of their mismanagement are
significant. While the field of artificial intelligence ethics is able
to provide a broad framework for those designing and implementing these
technologies into the operating room, there is a need to determine and
address the ethical and data governance challenges of using digital
technology in this unique environment.
Objective: The objectives of this study are to define the term digital
surgery and gain expert consensus on the key ethical and data governance
issues, barriers, and future research goals of the use of artificial
intelligence in surgery.
Methods: Experts from the fields of surgery, ethics and law, policy,
artificial intelligence, and industry will be invited to participate in
a 4-round consensus Delphi exercise. In the first round, participants
will supply free-text responses across 4 key domains. ethics, data
governance, barriers, and future research goals. They will also be asked
to provide their understanding of the term digital surgery. In
subsequent rounds, statements will be grouped, and participants will be
asked to rate the importance of each issue on a 9-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (critically important).
Consensus is defined a priori as a score of 7 to 9 by 70\% of

article,"Artificial Intelligence for Automatic Measurement of Left Ventricular
Strain in Echocardiography","OBJECTIVES This study sought to examine if fully automated measurements
of global longitudinal strain (GLS) using a novel motion estimation
technology based on deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are
feasible and comparable with a conventional speckle-tracking
application. BACKGROUND GLS is an important parameter when evaluating
left ventricular function. However, analyses of GLS are time consuming
and demand expertise, and thus are underused in clinical practice.
METHODS In this study, 200 patients with a wide range of left ventricle
(LV) function were included. Three standard apical cine-loops were
analyzed using the AI pipeline. The AI method measured GLS and was
compared with a commercially available semiautomatic speckle-tracking
software (EchoPAC v202, GE Healthcare. RESULTS The AI method succeeded
to both correctly classify all 3 standard apical views and perform
timing of cardiac events in 89\% of patients. Furthermore, the method
successfully performed automatic segmentation, motion estimates, and
measurements of GLS in all examinations, across different cardiac
pathologies and throughout the spectrum of LV function. GLS was-12.0 +/-
4.1\% for the AI method and-13.5 +/- 5.3\% for the reference method.
Bias was-1.4 +/- 0.3\% (95\% limits of agreement: 2.3 to-5.1), which is
comparable with intervendor studies. The AI method eliminated
measurement variability and a complete GLS analysis was processed within
15 s. CONCLUSIONS Through the range of LV function this novel AI method
succeeds, without any operator input, to automatically identify the 3
standard apical views, perform timing of cardiac events, trace the
myocardium, perform motion estimation, and measure GLS. Fully automated
measurements based on AI could facilitate the clinical implementation of
GLS. (J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2021;14:1918-1928) (c) 2021 The Authors.

The Current Understanding and Impact on Radiology as a Future Specialty
Choice","Background: Medical students' career choices and motivations might be
significantly impacted by the rapid advances in artificial intelligence
(AI) and the recent hype around it.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the impact of AI on medical
students' preferences for radiology as a future specialty choice.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and
December 2021 among all medical students in the three regional medical
colleges in Al-Qassim Province, Saudi Arabia.
Results: The survey resulted in 319 complete responses. Among the
respondents, 26.96\% considered radiology to be one of their top three
future specialty choices. Only a minority of the respondents (23.2\%)
believed that radiologists would be replaced by AI during their
lifetime. The misperceptions of the potential impact of AI led 22.26\%
of the students to be less likely to consider a career in radiology.
Students with an interest in radiology were less influenced by such
misperceptions (p=.01). Based on self-reported confidence measures, the
basic understanding of AI was higher among students with an interest in
radiology and students with prior exposure to AI (p<.05).

Literature Review","The use of neurophysiological measurements to advance the design,
development, use, acceptance, influence and adaptivity of information
systems is receiving increasing attention. Within the field of
education, neurophysiological measurements have commonly been used to
capture a learner's psychological constructs such as cognitive load,
attention and emotion, which play an important role in student learning.
This paper systematically examines the literature on the use of
neurophysiological measurements in higher education. In particular,
using a well-established Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, we
identified 83 papers reporting empirical evidence about the outcome of
employing neurophysiological measurements within educational
technologies in higher education. The findings of the SLR are divided
into three main themes discussing the employed measurements,
experimental settings and constructs and outcomes. Our findings identify
that (1) electroencephalography and facial expression recognition are
the dominantly employed types of measurement, (2) the majority of the
experiments used a pre-experimental design, (3) attention and emotion
are the two foremost cognitive and non-cognitive constructs under
investigation, while less emphasis is paid to meta-cognitive constructs
and (4) the reported results mostly focus on monitoring learners'
states, which are not always the same as the intended purpose, such as
developing an adaptive system. On a broader term, the review of the
literature provides evidence of the effective use of neurophysiological
measurements by educational technologies to enhance learning; however, a
number of challenges and concerns related to the accuracy and validity
of the captured construct, the intrusiveness of the employed instruments
as well as ethical and privacy considerations have surfaced, that need
to be addressed before such technologies can be employed and adopted at

average, only half of the plants per plot and misidentified or failed to
identify a high proportion of species compared with the experts,
regardless of the identification tool. In addition, the number of plants
identified that did not occur at all in the region or in the considered

Specifically, we work with denoising diffusion probabilistic models and
show how these models in combination with replica exchange molecular
dynamics achieve superior sampling of the biomolecular energy landscape
at temperatures that were never simulated without assuming any
particular slow degrees of freedom. The key idea is to treat the
temperature as a fluctuating random variable and not a control parameter
as is usually done. This allows us to directly sample from the joint
probability distribution in configuration and temperature space. The
results here are demonstrated for a chirally symmetric peptide and
single-strand RNA undergoing conformational transitions in all-atom
water. We demonstrate how we can discover transition states and
metastable states that were previously unseen at the temperature of
interest and even bypass the need to perform further simulations for a
wide range of temperatures. At the same time, any unphysical states are
easily identifiable through very low Boltzmann weights. The procedure
while shown here for a class of molecular simulations should be more

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to evaluate the impact of an
automated AI platform integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
interpretation on radiologists' interpretation times when evaluated in a
real-world clinical setting.
METHODS. In this prospective single-center study, a commercial AI
software solution was integrated into clinical workflow for chest CT
interpretation. The software provided automated analysis of cardiac,
pulmonary, and musculoskeletal findings, including labeling, segmenting,
and measuring normal structures as well as detecting, labeling, and
measuring abnormalities. AI-annotated images and autogenerated summary
results were stored in the PACS and available to interpreting
radiologists. A total of 390 patients (204 women, 186 men; mean age,
62.8 +/- 13.3 {[}SD] years) who underwent outpatient chest CT between
January 19, 2021, and January 28, 2021, were included. Scans were
randomized using 1:1 allocation between AI-assisted and non-AI-assisted
arms and were clinically interpreted by one of three cardiothoracic
radiologists (65 scans per arm per radiologist; total of 195 scans per
arm) who recorded interpretation times using a stopwatch. Findings were
categorized according to review of report impressions. Interpretation
times were compared between arms.
RESULTS. Mean interpretation times were significantly shorter in the
AI-assisted than in the non-AI-assisted arm for all three readers (289
+/- 89 vs 344 +/- 129 seconds, p < .001; 449 +/- 110 vs 649 +/- 82
seconds, p < .001; 281 +/- 114 vs 348 +/- 93 seconds, p = .01) and for
readers combined (328 +/- 122 vs 421 +/- 175 seconds, p < .001). For
readers combined, the mean difference was 93 seconds (95\% CI, 63-123
seconds), corresponding with a 22.1\% reduction in the AI-assisted arm.
Mean interpretation time was also shorter in the AI-assisted arm
compared with the non-AI-assisted arm for contrast- enhanced scans (83
seconds), noncontrast scans (104 seconds), negative scans (84 seconds),
positive scans without significant new findings (117 seconds), and
positive scans with significant new findings (92 seconds).
CONCLUSION. Cardiothoracic radiologists exhibited a 22.1\% reduction in
chest CT interpretations times when they had access to results from an
automated AI support platform during real-world clinical practice.
CLINICAL IMPACT. Integration of the AI support platform into clinical
workflow improved radiologist efficiency.","Yacoub, Basel and Varga-Szemes, Akos and Schoepf, U. Joseph and Kabakus,

learning environment. The notion of e-learning has taken on a new sense
with the advent and popularization of mobile devices and ubiquitous
computing, enabling students to have access to several diverse
opportunities for communicating with e-learning programs. Around the
same time, it has prompted the course's planners to select the most
suitable technology from among the various innovations required for the
storing and dissemination of information representation. As a Learning
Management System (LMS), the Blackboard system now has a recog-nized
role in the knowledge management of the education system. Blackboard
offers effective and easy-to-use instructional teaching, correspondence,
and assessment systems. Blackboard Ally works to create more open
content for inter-active classes and helps institutions create a more
balanced experience of teaching and learning. Blackboard Ally is a
unique application that easily blends with the Virtual Learning
Environment (VLE) and runs directly within the workflows currently used
by administrators, instructors, and students. This analysis is intended
to explore the successful utilization and assessment of Blackboard Ally
among academics in the Jazan University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The
key purpose of this study is to examine how administrators, faculty
members, and students use Ally for Blackboard LMS's functionality across
online classes to analyze both the learning process and the success of
the individual. A critical review of the literature, utilization, and

article,"Artificial Intelligence in Cornea, Refractive Surgery, and Cataract:
Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Future Directions","Corneal diseases, uncorrected refractive errors, and cataract represent
the major causes of blindness globally. The number of refractive
surgeries, either cornea- or lens-based, is also on the rise as the
demand for perfect vision continues to increase. With the recent
advancement and potential promises of artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies demonstrated in the realm of ophthalmology, particularly
retinal diseases and glaucoma, AI researchers and clinicians are now
channeling their focus toward the less explored ophthalmic areas related
to the anterior segment of the eye. Conditions that rely on anterior

article,"Artificial Intelligence Supporting the Training of Communication Skills
in the Education of Health Care Professions: Scoping Review","Background: Communication is a crucial element of every health care
profession, rendering communication skills training in all health care
professions as being of great importance. Technological advances such as
artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly machine learning (ML) may
support this cause: it may provide students with an opportunity for
easily accessible and readily available communication training.
Objective: This scoping review aimed to summarize the status quo
regarding the use of AI or ML in the acquisition of communication skills
in academic health care professions.
Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature search across the
PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science Core Collection, and
CINAHL databases to identify articles that covered the use of AI or ML
in communication skills training of undergraduate students pursuing
health care profession education. Using an inductive approach, the
included studies were organized into distinct categories. The specific
characteristics of the studies, methods and techniques used by AI or ML
applications, and main outcomes of the studies were evaluated.
Furthermore, supporting and hindering factors in the use of AI and ML
for communication skills training of health care professionals were
outlined.
Results: The titles and abstracts of 385 studies were identified, of
which 29 (7.5\%) underwent full-text review. Of the 29 studies, based on
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 (3.1\%) were included. The
studies were organized into 3 distinct categories: studies using AI and
ML for text analysis and information extraction, studies using AI and ML
and virtual reality, and studies using AI and ML and the simulation of
virtual patients, each within the academic training of the communication
skills of health care professionals. Within these thematic domains, AI
was also used for the provision of feedback. The motivation of the
involved agents played a major role in the implementation process.
Reported barriers to the use of AI and ML in communication skills
training revolved around the lack of authenticity and limited natural
flow of language exhibited by the AI-and ML-based virtual patient
systems. Furthermore, the use of educational AI-and ML-based systems in
communication skills training for health care professionals is currently
limited to only a few cases, topics, and clinical domains.
Conclusions: The use of AI and ML in communication skills training for
health care professionals is clearly a growing and promising field with
a potential to render training more cost-effective and less
time-consuming. Furthermore, it may serve learners as an individualized
and readily available exercise method. However, in most cases, the
outlined applications and technical solutions are limited in terms of
access, possible scenarios, the natural flow of a conversation, and
authenticity. These issues still stand in the way of any widespread
implementation ambitions.","Stamer, Tjorven and Steinhaeuser, Jost and Flaegel, Kristina","communication; education; artificial intelligence; machine learning;

article,"Adaptive cognitive fit: Artificial intelligence augmented management of
information facets and representations","Explosive growth in big data technologies and artificial intelligence
(AI) applications have led to increasing pervasiveness of information
facets and a rapidly growing array of information representations.
Information facets, such as equivocality and veracity, can dominate and
significantly influence human perceptions of information and
consequently affect human performance. Extant research in cognitive fit,
which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on the effects of
aligning information representation and task on performance, without
sufficient consideration to information facets and attendant cognitive
challenges. Therefore, there is a compelling need to understand the
interplay of these dominant information facets with information
representations and tasks, and their influence on human performance. We
suggest that artificially intelligent technologies that can adapt
information representations to overcome cognitive limitations are
necessary for these complex information environments. To this end, we
propose and test a novel ``Adaptive Cognitive Fit{''} (ACF) framework
that explains the influence of information facets and AI-augmented
information representations on human performance. We draw on information
processing theory and cognitive dissonance theory to advance the ACF
framework and a set of propositions. We empirically validate the ACF
propositions with an economic experiment that demonstrates the influence
of information facets, and a machine learning simulation that
establishes the viability of using AI to improve human performance.","Samuel, Jim and Kashyap, Rajiv and Samuel, Yana and Pelaez, Alexander","Adaptive; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive fit; Equivocality;

Concept Study Using Artificial Intelligence for Risk Assessment","Several scoring systems have been devised to objectively predict
survival for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma

prognostication using an artificial intelligence-based approach. We
retrospectively identified 417 patients with ICC who were referred to
our tertiary care center between 1997 and 2018. Of these, 293 met the
inclusion criteria. Established risk factors served as input nodes for
an artificial neural network (ANN). We compared the performance of the
trained model to the most widely used conventional scoring system, the
Fudan score. Predicting 1-year survival, the ANN reached an area under
the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89 for the training set and 0.80 for the
validation set. The AUC of the Fudan score was significantly lower in
the validation set (0.77, p < 0.001). In the training set, the Fudan
score yielded a lower AUC (0.74) without reaching significance (p =
0.24). Thus, ANNs incorporating a multitude of known risk factors can
outperform conventional risk scores, which typically consist of a
limited number of parameters. In the future, such artificial

malignancy. CD8+ T cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), and tumor budding
(TB) have been significantly correlated with the outcome of patients
with PDAC, but the correlations have been independently reported. In
addition, no integrated immune-CSC-TB profile for predicting survival in
patients with PDAC has been established. Methods: Multiplexed
immunofluorescence and artificial intelligence (AI)-based comprehensive
analyses were used for quantification and spatial distribution analysis
of CD8+ T cells, CD133+ CSCs, and TB. In vivo humanized patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models were established. Nomogram analysis, calibration
curve, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, and
decision curve analyses were performed using R software. Results: The
established `anti-/pro-tumor' models showed that the CD8+ T cell/TB,
CD8+ T cell/CD133+ CSC, TB-adjacent CD8+ T cell, and CD133+ CSC-adjacent
CD8+ T cell indices were positively associated with survival of patients
with PDAC. These findings were validated using PDX-transplanted
humanized mouse models. An integrated nomogram-based immune-CSC-TB
profile that included the CD8+ T cell/TB and CD8+ T cell/CD133+ CSC

-metastasis stage model in predicting survival of patients with PDAC.
Conclusions: `Anti-/pro-tumor' models and the spatial relationship among
CD8+ T cells, CSCs, and TB within the tumor microenvironment were
investigated. Novel strategies to predict the prognosis of patients with

absence of a gold-standard open cavity surgical field deprives
physicians of the opportunity for tactile feedback and visual

Materials and methods A web-based questionnaire was distributed to the
membership of several paediatric and general radiological societies over
a 4-month period (1 Feb - 31 May 2020). Survey questions covered
attitudes toward AI in general, future impacts and suggested areas for
development specifically within paediatric imaging. Results Two hundred

constructing evaluation models of university students' ideological and
political education are put forward. Secondly, in case to meet changing
needs of the times, an artificial neural network algorithm based on
artificial intelligence data mining and a traditional multi-layer fuzzy
evaluation model are designed to evaluate the ideological and political
education of college students. This newly proposed model integrates
learning, association, recognition, self-adaptive and fuzzy information
processing, and at the same time, it overcomes their respective
shortcomings. Finally, an example analysis is carried out with a nearby

article,"Application of Artificial Intelligence in Static Formation Temperature
Estimation","This study presents a new model to predict the static formation
temperature in multiple geothermal fields using multiple machine
learning algorithms. Both artificial intelligence and non-artificial
intelligent algorithms were used for this prediction. The model
developed in this study predicts static formation temperature using
several machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural
networks, fuzzy logic, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest
algorithms. Results are compared with the real temperatures obtained
from two geothermal wells. The random forest, fuzzy logic, and k-nearest
neighbors algorithms outperformed the artificial neural network, with
the random forest algorithm achieving higher accuracy. The MAE of the
random forest algorithm was 0.7\% and the RMSE was 0.9\%. The MAE values
for the other machine learning algorithms ranging from 1.5 to 8.4\%, and
the RMSE values ranged from 2 to 20.8\%. Artificial intelligence methods
were found to be more accurate than non-artificial intelligence
(mathematical) methods, with varying percentages. The results generated
by the unique new model computation and the measured test data are
substantially matched when compared to computed data and observed
temperature data. The novelty of this newly developed artificial

Intelligence among Healthcare Students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","Background and Objective: The role of the pharmacist in healthcare
society is unique, since they are providers of health information and
medication counseling to patients. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate
Awareness, Perceptions, and Opinions towards Artificial intelligence
(AI) among pharmacy undergraduate students at King Saud University
(KSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional,
questionnaire-based study was conducted between December 2022 and
January 2023 using online questionnaires. The data collection was
carried out using convenience sampling methods among senior pharmacy
students at the College of Pharmacy, King Saud University. Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences version 26 was used to analyze the data
(SPSS). Results: A total of one hundred and fifty-seven pharmacy
students completed the questionnaires. Of these, most of them (n = 118;
75.2\%) were males. About 42\%, (n = 65) were in their fourth year of
study. Most of the students (n = 116; 73.9\%) knew about AI. In
addition, 69.4\% (n = 109) of the students thought that AI is a tool
that helps healthcare professionals (HCP). However, more than half
57.3\% (n = 90) of the students were aware that AI would assist
healthcare professionals in becoming better with the widespread use of
AI. Furthermore, 75.1\% of the students agreed that AI reduces errors in
medical practice. The mean positive perception score was 29.8 (SD =

pathology: a scientometric study","Background With the development of digital pathology and the renewal of
deep learning algorithm, artificial intelligence (AI) is widely applied
in tumor pathology. Previous researches have demonstrated that AI-based
tumor pathology may help to solve the challenges faced by traditional
pathology. This technology has attracted the attention of scholars in
many fields and a large amount of articles have been published. This
study mainly summarizes the knowledge structure of AI-based tumor
pathology through bibliometric analysis, and discusses the potential
research trends and foci. Methods Publications related to AI-based tumor
pathology from 1999 to 2021 were selected from Web of Science Core
Collection. VOSviewer and Citespace were mainly used to perform and
visualize co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of
countries, institutions, authors, references and keywords in this field.
Results A total of 2753 papers were included. The papers on AI-based
tumor pathology research had been continuously increased since 1999. The
United States made the largest contribution in this field, in terms of
publications (1138, 41.34\%), H-index (85) and total citations (35,539

article,"Cost-effectiveness of artificial intelligence screening for diabetic
retinopathy in rural China","Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has become a leading cause of
global blindness as a microvascular complication of diabetes. Regular
screening of diabetic retinopathy is strongly recommended for people
with diabetes so that timely treatment can be provided to reduce the
incidence of visual impairment. However, DR screening is not well
carried out due to lack of eye care facilities, especially in the rural
areas of China. Artificial intelligence (AI) based DR screening has
emerged as a novel strategy and show promising diagnostic performance in
sensitivity and specificity, relieving the pressure of the shortage of
facilities and ophthalmologists because of its quick and accurate
diagnosis. In this study, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of AI
screening for DR in rural China based on Markov model, providing
evidence for extending use of AI screening for DR. Methods We estimated
the cost-effectiveness of AI screening and compared it with
ophthalmologist screening in which fundus images are evaluated by
ophthalmologists. We developed a Markov model-based hybrid decision tree
to analyze the costs, effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) of AI screening strategies relative to no screening
strategies and ophthalmologist screening strategies (dominated) over 35
years (mean life expectancy of diabetes patients in rural China). The
analysis was conducted from the health system perspective (included
direct medical costs) and societal perspective (included medical and
nonmedical costs). Effectiveness was analyzed with quality-adjusted life
years (QALYs). The robustness of results was estimated by performing
one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic analysis. Results From
the health system perspective, AI screening and ophthalmologist
screening had incremental costs of \$180.19 and \$215.05 but more
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with no screening. AI
screening had an ICER of \$1,107.63. From the societal perspective which
considers all direct and indirect costs, AI screening had an ICER of
\$10,347.12 compared with no screening, below the cost-effective
threshold (1-3 times per capita GDP of Chinese in 2019). Conclusions Our
analysis demonstrates that AI-based screening is more cost-effective
compared with conventional ophthalmologist screening and holds great
promise to be an alternative approach for DR screening in the rural area
of China.","Huang, Xiao-Mei and Yang, Bo-Fan and Zheng, Wen-Lin and Liu, Qun and

Intelligence Systems","This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of
public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and
the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence
systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a
software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value
(e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the
Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or
government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are
trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be
trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas
private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains
are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers,
with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording
transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda,
Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics
and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial
intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together
with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is
its role in creating ``clean data{''}: validated, trustable,
interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop
across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes,
and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset
pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt
and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in

article,Artificial intelligence in breast imaging,"This article reviews current limitations and future opportunities for
the application of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems and artificial
intelligence in breast imaging. Traditional CAD systems in mammography
screening have followed a rules-based approach, incorporating domain
knowledge into hand-crafted features before using classical machine
learning techniques as a classifier. The first commercial CAD system,
ImageChecker M1000, relies on computer vision techniques for pattern
recognition. Unfortunately, CAD systems have been shown to adversely
affect some radiologists' performance and increase recall rates. The
Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge was a multidisciplinary
collaboration that provided 640,000 mammography images for teams to help
decrease false-positive rates in breast cancer screening. Winning
solutions leveraged deep learning's (DL) automatic hierarchical feature
learning capabilities and used convolutional neural networks. Start-ups
Therapixel and Kheiron Medical Technologies are using DL for breast
cancer screening. With increasing use of digital breast tomosynthesis,
specific artificial intelligence (AI)-CAD systems are emerging to
include iCAD's PowerLook Tomo Detection and ScreenPoint Medical's
Transpara. Other Al-CAD systems are focusing on breast diagnostic
techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
There is a gap in the market for contrast-enhanced spectral mammography

in scenarios mimicking real life to prove its usefulness in the clinical
environment. This requires a large and representative dataset for
testing and assessment of the reader's interaction with the tools. A

exponential growth, especially in image production, image processing and
image interpretation. It is expected that radiographers working across
all imaging modalities have adequate knowledge as they are part of the
end-user team. The current study aimed to investigate the knowledge,
willingness and challenges facing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
technologists in the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into
MRI practice.
Methods: Total of 120 participants were recruited using a snowball
sampling technique. A two-phase study was undertaken using survey and
focus group discussion (FGD) to capture participants' knowledge,
interpretations, needs and obstacles toward AI integrations in MRI
practice. The survey and FGD provided the base to understand the
participant's' knowledge, acceptance and needs for AI.
Results: Results showed medium to high knowledge, excitement about AI
integration without disturbance of MRI practice. Participants thought
that AI can improve MRI protocol selection (91.8\%), reduce the scan
time (65.3\%), and improve image post-processing (79.5\%). Education and
learning resources concerning AI were the main obstacles facing MRI
technologists.
Conclusion: MRI technologists have the knowledge and possess basic
technical information. The application of AI in MRI practice might
greatly influence and improve MRI technologist's work. A structured and
professional program should be integrated in both undergraduate and
continuous education to prepare for effective AI implementation.
Implications for practice: Application of AI in MRI can be used in many
aspects, such as optimize image quality and avoidance of image
artifacts. Moreover, AI can play an important role in patient's safety
at the MRI unit to reduce incidents. Education, infrastructure, and
knowledge of end-users are keys for the incorporation of AI use,
development and optimisation. (C) 2021 The College of Radiographers.

article,"Artificial intelligence-enhanced seismic response prediction of
reinforced concrete frames","Existing physics-based modeling approaches do not have a good compromise
between performance and computational efficiency in predicting the
seismic response of reinforced concrete (RC) frames, where highfidelity
models (e.g., fiber-based modeling method) have reasonable predictive
performance but are computationally demanding, while more simplified
models (e.g., shear building model) are the opposite. This paper
proposes a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced computational
method for seismic response prediction of RC frames which can remedy
these problems. The proposed AI-enhanced method incorporates an AI
technique with a shear building model, where the AI technique can
directly utilize the real-world experimental data of RC columns to
determine the lateral stiffness of each column in the target RC frame
while the structural stiffness matrix is efficiently formulated via the
shear building model. Therefore, this scheme can enhance prediction
accuracy due to the use of real-world data while maintaining high
computational efficiency due to the incorporation of the shear building
model. Two data-driven seismic response solvers are developed to
implement the proposed approach based on a database including 272 RC
column specimens. Numerical results demonstrate that compared to the
experimental data, the proposed method outperforms the fiber-based
modeling approach in both prediction capability and computational
efficiency and is a promising tool for accurate and efficient seismic
response prediction of structural systems.","Luo, Huan and Paal, Stephanie German","Artificial intelligence-enhanced shear building; model; Machine

Techniques: A Systematic Review","The prediction of tropospheric ozone concentrations is vital due to
ozone's passive impacts on atmosphere, people's health, flora and fauna.

the rapid development in the technology and the increase in the number
of measured data, artificial intelligence techniques have been
intensively used in predicting ozone concentration as an alternative to
the traditional models. Therefore, the main objective of this study is
to investigate the most developed techniques that have been used in
predicting ozone concentrations as well as theoretic approaches such as
information set approaches, fuzzy set approach and probabilistic set
approaches. It is clearly stated that the standalone algorithms such as
decision tree (DT) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed
multilayer perceptron (MLP); however, the latter is massively
implemented by many researchers in the prediction of ozone
concentrations. This review paper investigated artificial intelligence
techniques integrated with optimization approaches. It can be concluded
that hybrid algorithms have significantly improved the prediction
accuracy. However, the majority of the proposed hybrid models have
limitations; thus, there is a need to develop better hybrid algorithm
that is able to tackle all the drawbacks of the improved algorithms and

Initiatives to Enhance its Decision-making Process?","Interest in the use of analytics to support evidence-based
decision-making in higher education is relatively a new phenomenon. The
available research suggests that analytics can enhance an institution's
ability to make evidence-based informed decisions that foster growth and
increased productivity. The present study explored how institutions of
higher education in New Zealand value and utilise analytics to enhance
the quality of decision-making. The study involved administering an
online questionnaire (n = 82) to senior administrators from seven of the
eight research-intensive public universities in New Zealand. Key
findings revealed that the use of analytics in the higher education
sector could enhance the quality of decision-making. Respondents
reported that the use of analytics is likely to advance operational and
strategic decisions by monitoring and efficiently optimising the use of
resources. Respondents said that analytics provide better planning of
issues about students (e.g. enrolment, retention, and completion rate).
Furthermore, analytics can improve institutional research administration
(e.g. performance outcomes in finance and human resources). Despite the
stated benefits of analytics in enhancing decision-making in many
operational and strategic areas, the study found that the use of
analytics in the higher education sector in New Zealand is limited to
monitoring operational activities, rather than improving the quality of
learning, teaching and strategic initiatives. Further, the study
identified several concerns regarding the ability of institutions to
find the capacity and expertise to extract useful information from the
available data sets and to turn such data into usable knowledge to
support students and educators. Also, respondents were concerned that
the lack of staff capacity and training to use analytics effectively
could be detrimental. Others feared that analytics could be used as
surveillance tools and enforce compliance and control. It was mentioned
that over-reliance on analytics could easily lead to a breach of
individuals' and institutional privacy, which is a threat to information
and data security. Also, there was a concern that analytics could be
used to perpetuate inequity and inequality among and within
institutions. Results of the study presented in this article serve as a
baseline for future studies about the use of analytics in the higher
education sector in New Zealand. Additionally, it contributes to the
growing debate about the value and challenges of deploying analytics and

and used chatbots as AI-based technologies in the experiment. The
analyses revealed that intrinsic motivation and competence to learn with
the chatbot depended on both teacher support and student expertise (i.e.
self-regulated learning and digital literacy), and the teacher support
better satisfied the need for relatedness, and it less satisfied the
need for autonomy. The findings refined our understanding about the

article,"Artificial intelligence in radiography: Where are we now and what does
the future hold?","Objectives: This paper will outline the status and basic principles of
artificial intelligence (AI) in radiography along with some thoughts and
suggestions on what the future might hold. While the authors are not
always able to separate the current status from future developments in
this field, given the speed of innovation in AI, every effort has been
made to give a view to the present with projections to the future.
Key findings: AI is increasingly being integrated within radiography and
radiographers will increasingly be working with AI based tools in the
future. As new AI tools are developed it is essential that robust
validation is undertaken in unseen data, supported by more prospective
interdisciplinary research. A framework of stronger, more comprehensive
approvals are recommended and the involvement of service users,
including practitioners, patients and their carers in the design and
implementation of AI tools is essential. Clearer accountability and
medicolegal frameworks are required in cases of erroneous results from
the use of AI-powered software and hardware. Clearer career pathways and
role extension provision for healthcare practitioners, including
radiographers, are required along with education in this field where AI
will be central.
Conclusion: With the current growth rate of AI tools it is expected that
many of the applications in medical imaging will continue to develop to
more accurate, less expensive and more readily available versions moving
from the bench to the bedside. The hope is that, alongside efficiency
and increased patient throughput, patient centred care and precision
medicine will find their way in, so we will not only deliver a faster,
safer, seamless clinical service but also one that will have the
patients at its heart.
Impact for practice: AI is already reaching clinical practice in many
forms and its presence will continue to increase over the short and
long-term future. Radiographers must learn to work with AI, embracing it
and maximising the positive outcomes from this new technology. (C) 2021

status and potential application for the radiotherapy workforce","Objective: Radiation oncology is a continually evolving speciality. With
the development of new imaging modalities and advanced imaging
processing techniques, there is an increasing amount of data available
to practitioners. In this narrative review, Artificial Intelligence (AI)
is used as a reference to machine learning, and its potential, along
with current problems in the field of radiation oncology, are considered
from a technical position.
Key Findings: AI has the potential to harness the availability of data
for improving patient outcomes, reducing toxicity, and easing clinical
burdens. However, problems including the requirement of complexity of

now? What is on the horizon?","INTRODUCTION An increasing quantity of data is required to guide
precision medicine and advance future healthcare practices, but current
analytical methods often become overwhelmed. Artificial intelligence
(AI) provides a promising solution. Plastic surgery is an innovative
surgical specialty expected to implement AI into current and future
practices. It is important for all plastic surgeons to understand how AI
may affect current and future practice, and to recognise its potential
limitations.
METHODS Peer-reviewed published literature and online content were
comprehensively reviewed. We report current applications of AI in
plastic surgery and possible future applications based on published
literature and continuing scientific studies, and detail its potential
limitations and ethical considerations.
FINDINGS Current machine learning models using convolutional neural
networks can evaluate breast mammography and differentiate benign and
malignant tumours as accurately as specialist doctors, and motion sensor
surgical instruments can collate real-time data to advise intraoperative
technical adjustments. Centralised big data portals are expected to
collate large datasets to accelerate understanding of disease
pathogeneses and best practices.
Information obtained using computer vision could guide intraoperative
surgical decisions in unprecedented detail and semi-autonomous surgical
systems guided by AI algorithms may enable improved surgical outcomes in
low- and middle-income countries. Surgeons must collaborate with
computer scientists to ensure that AI algorithms inform clinically
relevant health objectives and are interpretable. Ethical concerns such
as systematic biases causing non-representative conclusions for
under-represented patient groups, patient confidentiality and the
limitations of AI based on the quality of data input suggests that AI
will accompany the plastic surgeon, rather than replace them.","Murphy, D. C. and Saleh, D. B.","Artificial intelligence; Plastic surgery; Big data; Machine learning;

Artificial Intelligence","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led to
substantial public discussion. Understanding these discussions can help
institutions, governments, and individuals navigate the pandemic.
Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze discussions on Twitter
related to COVID-19 and to investigate the sentiments toward COVID-19.
Methods: This study applied machine learning methods in the field of
artificial intelligence to analyze data collected from Twitter. Using
tweets originating exclusively in the United States and written in
English during the 1-month period from March 20 to April 19, 2020, the
study examined COVID-19-related discussions. Social network and
sentiment analyses were also conducted to determine the social network
of dominant topics and whether the tweets expressed positive, neutral,

Classroom Behavior Analysis with Embedded Devices","Modern education has undergone tremendous progress, and a large number
of advanced devices and technologies have been introduced into the
teaching process. We explore the application of artificial intelligence
to education, using AI devices for classroom behavior analysis. Embedded
systems are special-purpose computer systems tailored to an application.
Embedded system hardware for wearable devices is often characterized by
low computing power and small storage, and it cannot run complex models.
We apply lightweight models to embedded devices to achieve real-time
emotion recognition. When teachers teach in the classroom, embedded
portable devices can collect images in real-time and identify and count
students' emotions. Teachers can adjust teaching methods and obtain
better teaching results through feedback on students' learning status.
Our optimized lightweight model PIDM runs on low-computing embedded
devices with fast response times and reliable accuracy, which can be
effectively used in the classroom. Compared with traditional post-class
analysis, our method is real-time and gives teachers timely feedback
during teaching. The experiments in the control group showed that after
using smart devices, the classroom teaching effect increased by 9.44\%.

article,"Using Psychological Artificial Intelligence (Tess) to Relieve Symptoms
of Depression and Anxiety: Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Students in need of mental health care face many barriers
including cost, location, availability, and stigma. Studies show that
computer-assisted therapy and 1 conversational chatbot delivering
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offer a less-intensive and more
cost-effective alternative for treating depression and anxiety. Although
CBT is one of the most effective treatment methods, applying an
integrative approach has been linked to equally effective posttreatment
improvement. Integrative psychological artificial intelligence (AI)
offers a scalable solution as the demand for affordable, convenient,
lasting, and secure support grows.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of
using an integrative psychological AI, Tess, to reduce self-identified
symptoms of depression and anxiety in college students.
Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 75 participants were
recruited from 15 universities across the United States. All
participants completed Web-based surveys, including the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and
Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at baseline and 2 to 4 weeks
later (T2). The 2 test groups consisted of 50 participants in total and
were randomized to receive unlimited access to Tess for either 2 weeks
(n=24) or 4 weeks (n=26). The information-only control group
participants (n=24) received an electronic link to the National
Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) eBook on depression among college
students and were only granted access to Tess after completion of the
study.
Results: A sample of 74 participants completed this study with 0\%
attrition from the test group and less than 1\% attrition from the
control group (1/24). The average age of participants was 22.9 years,
with 70\% of participants being female (52/74), mostly Asian (37/74,
51\%), and white (32/74, 41\%). Group 1 received unlimited access to
Tess, with daily check-ins for 2 weeks. Group 2 received unlimited
access to Tess with biweekly check-ins for 4 weeks. The information-only
control group was provided with an electronic link to the NIMH's eBook.
Multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted. We used an alpha
level of .05 for all statistical tests. Results revealed a statistically
significant difference between the control group and group 1, such that
group 1 reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression as
measured by the PHQ-9 (P=.03), whereas those in the control group did
not. A statistically significant difference was found between the
control group and both test groups 1 and 2 for symptoms of anxiety as
measured by the GAD-7. Group 1 (P=.045) and group 2 (P=.02) reported a
significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, whereas the control group
did not. A statistically significant difference was found on the PANAS
between the control group and group 1 (P=.03) and suggests that Tess did
impact scores.
Conclusions: This study offers evidence that AI can serve as a
cost-effective and accessible therapeutic agent. Although not designed
to appropriate the role of a trained therapist, integrative
psychological AI emerges as a feasible option for delivering support.

Methods: The BPJS Kesehatan dataset have been preprocessed using a
nested case-control design into preeclampsia/eclampsia (n = 3318) and
normotensive pregnant women (n = 19,883) from all women with one
pregnancy. The dataset provided 95 features consisting of demographic
variables and medical histories started from 24 months to event and
ended by delivery as the event. Six algorithms were compared by area
under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) with a
subgroup analysis by time to the event. We compared our model to similar
prediction models from systematically reviewed studies. In addition, we
conducted a text mining analysis based on natural language processing
techniques to interpret our modeling results.
Findings: The best model consisted of 17 predictors extracted by a
random forest algorithm. Nine similar to 12 months to the event was the
period that had the best AUROC in external validation by either
geographical (0.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-0.89) or temporal

artificial intelligence, namely Pervasive AI, expanded the role of
ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing
distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized

blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation
of an individual learning path through testing students before the start

additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after
successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper

article,"Artificial Intelligence in Steam Cracking Modeling: A Deep Learning
Algorithm for Detailed Effluent Prediction","Chemical processes can benefit tremendously from fast and accurate
effluent composition prediction for plant design, control, and
optimization. The Industry 4.0 revolution claims that by introducing
machine learning into these fields, substantial economic and
environmental gains can be achieved. The bottleneck for high-frequency
optimization and process control is often the time necessary to perform
the required detailed analyses of, for example, feed and product. To
resolve these issues, a framework of four deep learning artificial
neural networks (DL ANNs) has been developed for the largest chemicals
production process-steam cracking. The proposed methodology allows both
a detailed characterization of a naphtha feedstock and a detailed
composition of the steam cracker effluent to be determined, based on a
limited number of commercial naphtha indices and rapidly accessible
process characteristics. The detailed characterization of a naphtha is
predicted from three points on the boiling curve and paraffins,
iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aronatics (PIONA)
characterization. If unavailable, the boiling points are also estimated.
Even with estimated boiling points, the developed DL ANN outperforms
several established methods such as maximization of Shannon entropy and
traditional ANNs. For feedstock reconstruction, a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 0.3 wt\% is achieved on the test set, while the MAE of the
effluent prediction is 0.1 wt\%. When combining all networks-using the
output of the previous as input to the next-the effluent MAE increases
to 0.19 wt\%. In addition to the high accuracy of the networks, a major
benefit is the negligible computational cost required to obtain the
predictions. On a standard Intel i7 processor, predictions are made in
the order of milliseconds. Commercial software such as COILSIM1D
performs slightly better in terms of accuracy, but the required central
processing unit time per reaction is in the order of seconds. This
tremendous speed-up and minimal accuracy loss make the presented
framework highly suitable for the continuous monitoring of
difficult-to-access process parameters and for the envisioned,
high-frequency real-time optimization (RTO) strategy or process control.
Nevertheless, the lack of a fundamental basis implies that fundamental
understanding is almost completely lost, which is not always
well-accepted by the engineering community. In addition, the performance
of the developed networks drops significantly for naphthas that are
highly dissimilar to those in the training set. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

been transferred to different application domains such as biomedicine.
Methods In this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via
data-driven evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
therapeutics in the context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing.
First, we discussed basic concepts, computational approaches, databases,
modeling approaches, and featurization techniques in drug
discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we automatically integrated
HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, pathways,
phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar
implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a
knowledge graph using the CROssBAR system. Results Following the
system-level evaluation and selection of critical genes/proteins and
pathways to target, our deep learning-based drug/compound-target protein
interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have been employed for
predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these critical targets.
Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated proteins which
had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D space
to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug
candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.
Conclusions We expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be
used as a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from
database-scale sets of compounds) to both HCC and other complex
diseases, which may subsequently be analyzed with more targeted in
silico and experimental approaches.","Cetin-Atalay, Rengul and Kahraman, Deniz Cansen and Nalbat, Esra and

resources engineering. In this work, using the ANFIS method, everyday
suspended sediment particles were estimated in different categories of
the river in US Sediment big data, and various flow rates were utilized

ANFIS is used to train actual data from the river and provide an AI
model with artificial data points. This artificial data point can show
the occurrence of disaster for a critical day with different flow rates.
The changing parameter in the AI model enables us to make a correct
decision about critical time for rivers. This study also concentrates on
the sensitivity investigation of ANFIS setting parameters on the
accurateness of numerical results in order to find the best ANFIS model
for rapid oscillation in the data set. The best performance of the ANFIS
method is achieved with the trimf membership function, the number of
input membership function = 16, and the number of iteration = 1000. The
results also showed that the ANFIS model can provide fast computational
calculation, and adding more nodes for the prediction cannot change the
overall time of calculation due to the meshless behavior of the model.
In addition to this model, we used the ant colony method for training of

Orthopedic Patients: Exploratory Quantitative and Qualitative Study","Background: Patient follow-up is an essential part of hospital ward
management. With the development of deep learning algorithms, individual
follow-up assignments might be completed by artificial intelligence
(AI). We developed an AI-assisted follow-up conversational agent that
can simulate the human voice and select an appropriate follow-up time
for quantitative, automatic, and personalized patient follow-up. Patient
feedback and voice information could be collected and converted into
text data automatically.
Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the
cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up to manual follow-up of
patients after surgery. The secondary objective was to compare the
feedback from AI-assisted follow-up to feedback from manual follow-up.
Methods: The AI-assisted follow-up system was adopted in the Orthopedic
Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in April 2019. A
total of 270 patients were followed up through this system. Prior to
that, 2656 patients were followed up by phone calls manually Patient
characteristics, telephone connection rate, follow-up rate, feedback
collection rate, time spent, and feedback composition were compared
between the two groups of patients.
Results: There was no statistically significant difference in age,
gender, or disease between the two groups. There was no significant
difference in telephone connection rate (manual . 2478/2656, 93.3\%;
AI-assisted: 249/270, 92.2\%; P=.50) or successful follow-up rate
(manual: 2301/2478, 92.9\%; AI-assisted: 231/249, 92.8\%; P=.96) between
the two groups. The time spent on 100 patients in the manual follow-up
group was about 9.3 hours. In contrast, the time spent on the
AI-assisted follow-up was close to 0 hours. The feedback rate in the
AI-assisted follow-up group was higher than that in the manual follow-up
group (manual: 68/2656, 2.5\%; AI-assisted: 28/270, 10.3\%; P<.001). The
composition of feedback was different in the two groups. Feedback from

Using Artificial Intelligence","OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to establish whether an
artificially intelligent (AI) system can be developed to automate stress
echocardiography analysis and support clinician
interpretation.BACKGROUND Coronary artery disease is the leading global
cause of mortality and morbidity and stress echocardi-ography remains
one of the most commonly used diagnostic imaging tests.METHODS An
automated image processing pipeline was developed to extract novel
geometric and kinematic features from stress echocardiograms collected
as part of a large, United Kingdom-based prospective, multicenter,
multivendor study. An ensemble machine learning classifier was trained,
using the extracted features, to identify patients with severe coronary
artery disease on invasive coronary angiography. The model was tested in
an independent U.S. study. How availability of an AI classification
might impact clinical interpretation of stress echocardiograms was
evaluated in a randomized crossover reader study.RESULTS Acceptable
classification accuracy for identification of patients with severe
coronary artery disease in the training data set was achieved on
cross-fold validation based on 31 unique geometric and kinematic
features, with a specificity of 92.7\% and a sensitivity of 84.4\%. This
accuracy was maintained in the independent validation data set. The use
of the AI classification tool by clinicians increased inter-reader
agreement and confidence as well as sensitivity for detection of disease
by 10\% to achieve an area under the receiver-operating characteristic

listening and speaking skills among Chinese college students. The
current manual test for CET-4 and CET-6 will be gradually replaced by a
computer test, and the CET-6 computer test will be included in the
``quality engineering{''} project of national university teaching. The
natural integration of artificial intelligence and education is
assisting in the transformation of the traditional education ecology.
Mind mapping has also had a significant impact on the education
industry, and it has significant value in current educational
applications. In order to truly realize personalized learning, we should
pay more attention to the educational noumenon that the status of
educators and learners has changed in education, that is, the
transformation from educators to learners' development. Artificial
intelligence technology can be used effectively by junior high school
English teachers to conduct oral English evaluation activities, which
can more accurately judge students' oral English expression ability and
serve as a useful tool for adjusting and improving students' learning

article,"Deployment of artificial intelligence for radiographic diagnosis of
COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency department","ObjectiveThe coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has inspired new
innovations in diagnosing, treating, and dispositioning patients during
high census conditions with constrained resources. Our objective is to
describe first experiences of physician interaction with a novel
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm designed to enhance physician
abilities to identify ground-glass opacities and consolidation on chest
radiographs.
MethodsDuring the first wave of the pandemic, we deployed a previously
developed and validated deep-learning AI algorithm for assisted
interpretation of chest radiographs for use by physicians at an academic
health system in Southern California. The algorithm overlays radiographs
with ``heat{''} maps that indicate pneumonia probability alongside
standard chest radiographs at the point of care. Physicians were
surveyed in real time regarding ease of use and impact on clinical
decisionmaking.
ResultsOf the 5125 total visits and 1960 chest radiographs obtained in
the emergency department (ED) during the study period, 1855 were
analyzed by the algorithm. Among these, emergency physicians were
surveyed for their experiences on 202 radiographs. Overall, 86\% either
strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the intervention was easy to use
in their workflow. Of the respondents, 20\% reported that the algorithm
impacted clinical decisionmaking.
ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first published literature
evaluating the impact of medical imaging AI on clinical decisionmaking
in the emergency department setting. Urgent deployment of a previously
validated AI algorithm clinically was easy to use and was found to have
an impact on clinical decision making during the predicted surge period
of a global pandemic.","Carlile, Morgan and Hurt, Brian and Hsiao, Albert and Hogarth, Michael

Intelligence Devices","With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, a technological
revolution has begun in the field of education, which has injected new
momentum into moral education. Today, civic education is developing
rapidly in countries around the world, while civic education in China is
still relatively lagging behind. In China, we need to optimize civic
education by building a comprehensive civic education system,
implementing the concept of people-oriented, gathering the joint efforts
of the whole society, expanding diversified civic education methods, and
selecting and enriching the contents of civic education. Artificial
intelligence technology enables higher education institutions to carry
out civic education, enrich teaching contents, broaden teaching methods,
and optimize teaching evaluation. However, technology-related
innovations are dualistic in nature, with essential, technical, and
value risks that hinder their effectiveness in civic education. This
paper proposes strategies for optimization in terms of improving digital
core risk response capabilities, establishing reliable technology risk
response mechanisms, and maintaining a foundation for civic education
response costs. Thus, weakening the risk factors of AI in civic
education facilitates the transformation of AI and technology to the
advantage of knowledge-based civic education. This paper discusses
strategies and methods for optimizing smart education using AI devices
and establishes a corresponding smart education platform to help
students with their ideological education. Based on the analysis of

designed algorithm has an accuracy of 99.02\% for keyframe detection in
the CK+ database and 98.35\% for the BU-4DFE database. The algorithm has
a high accuracy of keyframe detection for both expression databases. It
has a good eSect on the automatic detection of keyframes of expression

article,"Trauma outcome predictor: An artificial intelligence interactive
smartphone tool to predict outcomes in trauma patients","BACKGROUND Classic risk assessment tools often treat patients' risk
factors as linear and additive. Clinical reality suggests that the
presence of certain risk factors can alter the impact of other factors;
in other words, risk modeling is not linear. We aimed to use artificial
intelligence (AI) technology to design and validate a nonlinear risk
calculator for trauma patients. METHODS A novel, interpretable AI
technology called Optimal Classification Trees (OCTs) was used in an
80:20 derivation/validation split of the 2010 to 2016 American College
of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program database. Demographics,
emergency department vital signs, comorbidities, and injury
characteristics (e.g., severity, mechanism) of all blunt and penetrating
trauma patients 18 years or older were used to develop, train then
validate OCT algorithms to predict in-hospital mortality and
complications (e.g., acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, sepsis). A
smartphone application was created as the algorithm's interactive and
user-friendly interface. Performance was measured using the c-statistic
methodology. RESULTS A total of 934,053 patients were included (747,249
derivation; 186,804 validation). The median age was 51 years, 37\% were
women, 90.5\% had blunt trauma, and the median Injury Severity Score was
11. Comprehensive OCT algorithms were developed for blunt and
penetrating trauma, and the interactive smartphone application, Trauma
Outcome Predictor (TOP) was created, where the answer to one question
unfolds the subsequent one. Trauma Outcome Predictor accurately
predicted mortality in penetrating injury (c-statistics: 0.95
derivation, 0.94 validation) and blunt injury (c-statistics: 0.89
derivation, 0.88 validation). The validation c-statistics for predicting
complications ranged between 0.69 and 0.84. CONCLUSION We suggest TOP as
an AI-based, interpretable, accurate, and nonlinear risk calculator for
predicting outcome in trauma patients. Trauma Outcome Predictor can
prove useful for bedside counseling of critically injured trauma

USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","Background: Reducing the physical and mental weariness of drivers is
significant in improving healthy and safe driving. This paper is aim to
predict the stress level of drivers while braking in various conditions
of the track. By discovering the drivers' mental stress level, we are
able to safely and comfortably adjust the distance in relation to the
vehicle ahead.
Material/Methods: The initial step used was a study related to
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), safe distance
in braking, and the theory of mental stress. The data was collected by
doing a direct measurement of drivers' stress levels using the EEG tool.
The respondents were 5 parties around 30-50 years old who had experience
in driving for > 5 years. The research asembled 400 pieces of data about
braking including the data of the velocity before braking, track
varieties (cityroad, rural road, residential road, and toll road),
braking distance, stress level (EEG), and focus (EEG). The database
constructed was used to input the machine learning (AI) - Back
Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) in order to predict the drivers'
mental stress level.
Results: Referring to the data collection, each road type gave a
different value of metal stress and focus. City road drivers used an
average velocity of 23.24 Km/h with an average braking distance of 11.17
m which generated an average stress level of 53.44 and a focus value of
45.76.Under other conditions, city road drivers generated a 52.11 stress
level, the rural road = 48.65, and 50.23 for the toll road. BPNN
Training with 1 hidden layer, neuron = 17, ground transfer function,
sigmoid linear, and optimation using Genetic Algorithm (GA) obtained the
Mean Square Error (MSE) value = 0.00537. The road infrastructure,
driving behavior, and emerging hazards in driving took part in
increasing the stress level and concentration needs of the drivers.
Conclusion: The conclusion may be drawn that the available data and the
chosen BPNN structure were appropriate to be used in training and be
utilized to predict drivers' focus and mental stress level. This AI
module is beneficial in inputting the data to the braking car safety
system by considering those mental factors completing the existing
technical factor considerations.","Sugiono, Sugiono and Prasetya, Renaldi P. and Fanani, Angga A. and

translation in recent years. Compared with human translation, machine
translation is more efficient and convenient. However, machine
translation also has some problems. Compared with traditional human
translation, it cannot meet the requirements of faithfulness,

powerful English translation teaching tool instead of sticking to
traditional teaching and cultivating students who are completely unable
to compare it with neural network translation. Therefore, in the context
of rapid AI iteration, college English translation teaching should also
keep pace with the times. With the help of tools such as neural network
translation, English translation talents who can skillfully use AI

predictions in unmonitored catchments to increase our understanding of
hydrological processes. A recent effort has been made in the development
of hybrid (conceptual/machine learning) models that can preserve some of
the hydrological processes represented by conceptual models and can
improve streamflow predictions. However, these studies have not explored
how the data-driven component of hybrid models resolved runoff routing.
In this study, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are

values by approximately 27, 50, and 24\% for stations 17120000,
27380000, and 33680000, respectively, relative to the traditional

soil moisture in hydrological models. Differing from purely data-driven
hydrological models, the inclusion of the production storage in the
proposed hybrid model, which is responsible for estimating the water
balance, reduced the short- and long-term dependencies of input
variables for streamflow prediction. In addition, soil moisture
controlled water percolation, which was the main predictor of

which the added value of AI remains unclear. Purpose: To assess the
diagnostic performance of AI platforms for detecting M2 occlusions.
Methods: Studies that report the diagnostic performance of AI-based
detection of M2 occlusions were screened, and sensitivity and
specificity data were extracted using the semi-automated AutoLit
software (Nested Knowledge, MN) platform. STATA (version 16 IC; Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA) was used to conduct all
analyses. Results: Eight studies with a low risk of bias and significant
heterogeneity were included in the quantitative and qualitative
synthesis. The pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity of AI
platforms for M2 occlusion detection were 64\% (95\% CI, 53 to 74\%) and
97\% (95\% CI, 84 to 100\%), respectively. The area under the curve
(AUC) in the SROC curve was 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.83). Conclusion:
The current performance of the AI-based algorithm makes it more suitable

competition for employment of college students is increasing, and
society has higher requirements for the quality of high-tech talents,
which can result in mental health issues for college students.
Therefore, focusing on psychological education for college students and

inertia weights in PSO are dynamically adjusted to construct IPSO to
address the problem of slow overall convergence speed caused by the
initial randomization of weights in the DBN training process. IPSO is
then combined with DBN to adjust the initial weights for DBN training.
This work also proposes a series of countermeasures from different

validity of IPSO-DBN for college students' psychological characteristics
analysis is verified through comprehensive and systematic experiments,
and the feasibility of college students' mental health education
countermeasures is confirmed via comparison. Overall, this work provides

course of music's development, the evaluation of music teaching is an
inevitable step in the development of quality music. Universities are
important places that abound with musical souls and their contribution
to the development of music has been outstanding. But with the
development of the times, university music has been hampered in the
field of teaching and learning. As an important branch in the field of
computer science and information technology, artificial intelligence
technology contains many intersecting and comprehensive subject
connotations, bringing brand-new elements to music education. It has
also had an important impact on the development of music teaching. The
article focuses in depth on the traditional process of music development
in terms of the characteristics and ways of teaching music. Based on
this, the article further explores the integration of artificial
intelligence and music and analyses the role of emerging technologies as
an aid to music from the perspective of the times. And this article uses
emotion recognition as an evaluation index to explore the evaluation
role of artificial intelligence technology in college music teaching,
and improve the quality and efficiency of music teaching. The
experimental results show that the teacher's positive emotion rate based
on image data is 57.8\%, and the student's positive emotion rate is

could pass the rapid (radiographic) reporting component of the
Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) examination.
DESIGN Prospective multi-reader diagnostic accuracy study. SETTING
United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS One artificial intelligence candidate
(Smarturgences, Milvue) and 26 radiologists who had passed the FRCR
examination in the preceding 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Accuracy
and pass rate of the artificial intelligence compared with radiologists
across 10 mock FRCR rapid reporting examinations (each examination
containing 30 radiographs, requiring 90\% accuracy rate to pass).
RESULTS When non-interpretable images were excluded from the analysis,
the artificial intelligence candidate achieved an average overall
accuracy of 79.5\% (95\% confidence interval 74.1\% to 84.3\%) and
passed two of 10 mock FRCR examinations. The average radiologist
achieved an average accuracy of 84.8\% (76.1-91.9\%) and passed four of
10 mock examinations. The sensitivity for the artificial intelligence
was 83.6\% (95\% confidence interval 76.2\% to 89.4\%) and the
specificity was 75.2\% (66.7\% to 82.5\%), compared with summary
estimates across all radiologists of 84.1\% (81.0\% to 87.0\%) and
87.3\% (85.0\% to 89.3\%). Across 148/300 radiographs that were
correctly interpreted by >90\% of radiologists, the artificial
intelligence candidate was incorrect in 14/148 (9\%). In 20/300
radiographs that most (>50\%) radiologists interpreted incorrectly, the
artificial intelligence candidate was correct in 10/20 (50\%). Most
imaging pitfalls related to interpretation of musculoskeletal rather
than chest radiographs. CONCLUSIONS When special dispensation for the
artificial intelligence candidate was provided (that is, exclusion of
non-interpretable images), the artificial intelligence candidate was
able to pass two of 10 mock examinations. Potential exists for the
artificial intelligence candidate to improve its radiographic
interpretation skills by focusing on musculoskeletal cases and learning
to interpret radiographs of the axial skeleton and abdomen that are
currently considered ``non-interpretable.{''}","Shelmerdine, Susan Cheng and Martin, Helena and Shirodhar, Kapil and

article,"Clinical Utility and Functionality of an Artificial Intelligence-Based
App to Predict Mortality in COVID-19: Mixed Methods Analysis","Background: The artificial neural network (ANN) is an increasingly
important tool in the context of solving complex medical classification
problems. However, one of the principal challenges in leveraging
artificial intelligence technology in the health care setting has been
the relative inability to translate models into clinician workflow.
Objective: Here we demonstrate the development of a COVID-19 outcome
prediction app that utilizes an ANN and assesses its usability in the
clinical setting.
Methods: Usability assessment was conducted using the app, followed by a
semistructured end-user interview. Usability was specified by
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction measures. These data were
reported with descriptive statistics. The end-user interview data were
analyzed using the thematic framework method, which allowed for the
development of themes from the interview narratives. In total, 31
National Health Service physicians at a West London teaching hospital,
including foundation physicians, senior house officers, registrars, and
consultants, were included in this study.
Results: All participants were able to complete the assessment, with a
mean time to complete separate patient vignettes of 59.35 (SD 10.35)
seconds. The mean system usability scale score was 91.94 (SD 8.54),
which corresponds to a qualitative rating of ``excellent.{''} The
clinicians found the app intuitive and easy to use, with the majority
describing its predictions as a useful adjunct to their clinical
practice. The main concern was related to the use of the app in
isolation rather than in conjunction with other clinical parameters.
However, most clinicians speculated that the app could positively
reinforce or validate their clinical decision-making.
Conclusions: Translating artificial intelligence technologies into the
clinical setting remains an important but challenging task. We
demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and system usability of a
web-based app designed to predict the outcomes of patients with COVID-19

a field experiment of 396 students and more than 7400 instances, we have
analyzed students' performance considering the temporal distribution of
autonomous learning during courses from 2016/2017 to 2020/2021. After
applying unsupervised learning, results show 3 main profiles from the
clusters obtained in the simulations: students who work continuously,
those who do it in the last-minute, and those with a low performance in
the whole autonomous learning. We have found that the highest success
ratio is related to students that work in a continuous basis. However,
last-minute working is not necessarily linked to failure. We have also
found that students' marks can be predicted successfully taking into
account the whole data sets. However, predictions are worse when
removing data from the month before the final exam. These predictions
are useful to prevent students' wrong learning strategies, and to detect
malpractices such as copying. We have done all these analyses taking
into account the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, founding that students
worked in a more continuous basis in the confinement. This effect was
still present one year after. Finally, We have also included an analysis
of the techniques that could be more effective to keep in a future

40 Percent (B40). One of the focus areas in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan
(11MP) is to elevate the B40 household group towards the middle-income
society. In 2018, it was estimated that 4.1 million households belong to
this group. The government of Malaysia has widened access to higher
education for the B40 group in an effort to reduce the gaps in
socioeconomics and to improve their living standards. Statistical data
shows that since 2013, a yearly intake of students in bachelor's degree
programs in Malaysia's public universities amounts to more than 85,000.
Despite this huge number of enrolments, not all were able to graduate,
including students from low-income family background. Data mining
approach with machine learning techniques has been widely used
effectively and accurately to predict students at risk of dropping out
in general education. However, machine learning related works on student
attrition in Malaysia's higher education is generally lacking.
Therefore, in this research, three machine learning models were
developed using Decision Tree, Random Forest and Artificial Neural
Network algorithm in order to classify attrition among B40 students in
bachelor's degree programs in Malaysia's public universities.
Comparative performance analysis between the three models indicates that
the Random Forest model is the best model in predicting student
attrition in this study. Random Forest model outperforms the other two
models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure with the
value of 95.93\%, 97.10\%, 81.26\% and 88.50\%, respectively.

of breast density with independent validation in breast cancer risk
assessment","Breast density is an important risk factor for breast cancer that also
affects the specificity and sensitivity of screening mammography.
Current federal legislation mandates reporting of breast density for all
women undergoing breast cancer screening. Clinically, breast density is
assessed visually using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging
Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) scale. Here, we introduce an
artificial intelligence (AI) method to estimate breast density from
digital mammograms. Our method leverages deep learning using two
convolutional neural network architectures to accurately segment the
breast area. An AI algorithm combining superpixel generation and
radiomic machine learning is then applied to differentiate dense from
non-dense tissue regions within the breast, from which breast density is
estimated. Our method was trained and validated on a multi-racial,
multi-institutional dataset of 15,661 images (4,437 women), and then
tested on an independent matched case-control dataset of 6368 digital
mammograms (414 cases; 1178 controls) for both breast density estimation
and case-control discrimination. On the independent dataset, breast
percent density (PD) estimates from Deep-LIBRA and an expert reader were
strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.90). Moreover,
in a model adjusted for age and BMI, Deep-LIBRA yielded a higher
case-control discrimination performance (area under the ROC curve, AUC =
0.612 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.584, 0.640]) compared to four
other widely-used research and commercial breast density assessment
methods (AUCs = 0.528 to 0.599). Our results suggest a strong agreement
of breast density estimates between Deep-LIBRA and gold-standard
assessment by an expert reader, as well as improved performance in
breast cancer risk assessment over state-of-the-art open-source and
commercial methods. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

article,"Artificial Intelligence for Aortic Pressure Waveform Analysis During
Coronary Angiography Machine Learning for Patient Safety","OBJECTIVES This study developed a neural network to perform automated
pressure waveform analysis and allow real-time accurate identification
of damping.
BACKGROUND Damping of aortic pressure during coronary angiography must
be identified to avoid serious complications and make accurate coronary
physiology measurements. There are currently no automated methods to do
this, and so identification of damping requires constant monitoring,
which is prone to human error.
METHODS The neural network was trained and tested versus core laboratory
expert opinions derived from 2 separate datasets. A total of 5,709
aortic pressure waveforms of individual heart beats were extracted and
classified. The study developed a recurrent convolutional neural network
to classify beats as either normal, showing damping, or artifactual.
Accuracies were reported using the opinions of 2 independent core
laboratories.
RESULTS The neural network was 99.4\% accurate (95\% confidence
interval: 98.8\% to 99.6\%) at classifying beats from the testing
dataset when judged against the opinions of the internal core
laboratory. It was 98.7\% accurate (95\% confidence interval: 98.0\% to
99.2\%) when judged against the opinions of an external core laboratory
not involved in neural network training. The neural network was 100\%
sensitive, with no beats classified as damped misclassified, with a
specificity of 99.8\%. The positive predictive and negative predictive
values were 98.1\% and 99.5\%. The 2 core laboratories agreed more
closely with the neural network than with each other.
CONCLUSIONS Arterial waveform analysis using neural networks allows
rapid and accurate identification of damping. This demonstrates how
machine learning can assist with patient safety and the quality control
of procedures. (C) 2019 by the American College of Cardiology

Assisted Reproduction by In Vitro Fertilization","Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing
infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful
pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is one of those assisted
reproduction methods in which the sperm and eggs are combined outside
the human body in a specialized environment and kept for growth.
Assisted reproductive technology is helping humans by addressing
infertility using different medical procedures that help in a successful
pregnancy. The morphology of the embryological components is highly
related to the success of the assisted reproduction procedure. In
approximately 3-5 days, the embryo transforms into the blastocyst. To
prevent the multiple-birth risk and to increase the chance of pregnancy
the embryologist manually analyzes the blastocyst components and selects
valuable embryos to transfer to the women's uterus. The manual
microscopic analysis of blastocyst components, such as trophectoderm,
zona pellucida, blastocoel, and inner cell mass, is time-consuming and
requires keen expertise to select a viable embryo. Artificial
intelligence is easing medical procedures by the successful
implementation of deep learning algorithms that mimic the medical
doctor's knowledge to provide a better diagnostic procedure that helps
in reducing the diagnostic burden. The deep learning-based automatic
detection of these blastocyst components can help to analyze the
morphological properties to select viable embryos. This research
presents a deep learning-based embryo component segmentation network
(ECS-Net) that accurately detects trophectoderm, zona pellucida,
blastocoel, and inner cell mass for embryological analysis. The proposed
method (ECS-Net) is based on a shallow deep segmentation network that
uses two separate streams produced by a base convolutional block and a
depth-wise separable convolutional block. Both streams are densely
concatenated in combination with two dense skip paths to produce
powerful features before and after upsampling. The proposed ECS-Net is
evaluated on a publicly available microscopic blastocyst image dataset,
the experimental segmentation results confirm the efficacy of the
proposed method. The proposed ECS-Net is providing a mean Jaccard Index

article,"Artificial intelligence in orthopaedics: can Chat Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (ChatGPT) pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal
College of Surgeons (Trauma \& Orthopaedics) examination?","Purpose Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a large
language artificial intelligence (AI) model which generates contextually
relevant text in response to questioning. After ChatGPT successfully
passed the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, proponents have
argued it should play an increasing role in medical service provision
and education. AI in healthcare remains in its infancy, and the
reliability of AI systems must be scrutinized. This study assessed
whether ChatGPT could pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal
College of Surgeons (FRCS) examination in Trauma and Orthopaedic
Surgery. Methods The UK and Ireland In-Training Examination (UKITE) was
used as a surrogate for the FRCS. Papers 1 and 2 of UKITE 2022 were
directly inputted into ChatGPT. All questions were in a
single-best-answer format without wording alterations. Imaging was
trialled to ensure ChatGPT utilized this information. Results ChatGPT
scored 35.8\%: 30\% lower than the FRCS pass rate and 8.2\% lower than
the mean score achieved by human candidates of all training levels.
Subspecialty analysis demonstrated ChatGPT scored highest in basic
science (53.3\%) and lowest in trauma (0\%). In 87 questions answered
incorrectly, ChatGPT only stated it did not know the answer once and
gave incorrect explanatory answers for the remaining questions.
Conclusion ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order
judgement and multilogical thinking required to pass the FRCS
examination. Further, the current model fails to recognize its own
limitations. ChatGPT's deficiencies should be publicized equally as much
as its successes to ensure clinicians remain aware of its fallibility.
Key messages What is already known on this topic Following ChatGPT's
much-publicized success in passing the United States Medical Licensing
Examinations, clinicians and medical students are using the model
increasingly frequently for medical service provision and education.
However ChatGPT remains in its infancy, and the model's reliability and
accuracy remain unproven. What this study adds This study demonstrates
ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order judgement and
multilogical thinking required to pass the Fellowship of the Royal
College of Surgeons (FRCS) (Trauma \& Orthopaedics) examination.
Further, the current model fails to recognize its own limitations when
offering both direct and explanatory answers. How this study might
affect research, practice, or policy This study highlights the need for
medical students and clinicians to exert caution when employing ChatGPT
as a revision tool or applying it in clinical practice, and for patients
to be aware of its fallibilities when using it as a health resource.
Future research questions include: How can the reliability of ChatGPT's
responses be regulated moving forward? Do postgraduate examinations
adequately focus on higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking
rather than simple fact recall? Will future models of ChatGPT develop
the higher-order judgement to pass the FRCS (Trauma \& Orthopaedics)

article,A Survey on Artificial Intelligence in Chinese Sign Language Recognition,"Chinese Sign Language (CSL) offers the main means of communication for
the hearing impaired in China. Sign Language Recognition (SLR) can
shorten the distance between the hearing-impaired and healthy people and
help them integrate into the society. Therefore, SLR has become the
focus of sign language application research. Over the years, the
continuous development of new technologies provides a source and
motivation for SLR. This paper aims to cover the most recent approaches
in Chinese Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). With a thorough review of
superior methods from 2000 to 2019 in CSLR researches, various
techniques and algorithms such as scale-invariant feature transform,
histogram of oriented gradients, wavelet entropy, Hu moment invariant,
Fourier descriptor, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, dynamic time
warping, principal component analysis, autoencoder, hidden Markov model
(HMM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest, skin color modeling
method,k-NN, artificial neural network, convolutional neural network
(CNN), and transfer learning are discussed in detail, which are based on
several major stages, that is, data acquisition, preprocessing, feature
extraction, and classification. CSLR was summarized from some aspect as
follows: methods of classification and feature extraction,
accuracy/performance evaluation, and sample size/datasets. The
advantages and limitations of different CSLR approaches were compared.
It was found that data acquisition is mainly through Kinect and camera,
and the feature extraction focuses on hand's shape and spatiotemporal
factors, but ignoring facial expressions. HMM and SVM are used most in
the classification. CNN is becoming more and more popular, and a deep
neural network-based recognition approach will be the future trend.
However, due to the complexity of the contemporary Chinese language,
CSLR generally has a lower accuracy than other SLR. It is necessary to
establish an appropriate dataset to conduct comparable experiments. The
issue of decreasing accuracy as the dataset increases needs to resolve.
Overall, our study is hoped to give a comprehensive presentation for
those people who are interested in CSLR and SLR and to further
contribute to the future research.","Jiang, Xianwei and Satapathy, Suresh Chandra and Yang, Longxiang and

after reviewing the current knowledge gaps and technical and ethical
challenges in applying AI. Automated models have been largely used to
improve RA diagnosis since the early 2000s, and they have used a wide
variety of techniques, e.g., support vector machine, random forest, and
artificial neural networks. AI algorithms can facilitate screening and
identification of susceptible groups, diagnosis using omics, imaging,
clinical, and sensor data, patient detection within electronic health

relationships in real-time video, to create an algorithm for ultrasound
video analysis. The algorithm was trained on public domain IVC
ultrasound videos to improve its ability to recognize changes in varied

was randomly used for cross correlation during training. Data were
augmented through video rotation and manipulation to multiply effective
training data quantity. After training, the algorithm was tested on the
50 new IVC ultrasound video obtained from public domain sources and not
part of the data set used in training or cross validation. Fleiss' kappa
was calculated to compare level of agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
and between deep learning algorithm and POCUS experts.
ResultsThere was very substantial agreement between the 3 POCUS experts
with kappa = 0.65 (95\% CI = 0.49-0.81). Agreement between experts and

Risk Prediction of Hepatitis Patients","In recent years, artificial intelligence-based computer aided diagnosis

complex models such as deep learning achieve better performance than the
simple ones due to the nonlinear hypotheses of the real world clinical
data. However,complex model as a black box, which ignores why it make a
certain decision, causes the model distrust from clinicians. To solve
these issues, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework is
proposed in this paper to give the global and local interpretation of
auxiliary diagnosis of hepatitis while retaining the good prediction
performance. First, a public hepatitis classification benchmark from UCI
is used to test the feasibility of the framework. Then, the transparent
and black-box machine learning models are both employed to forecast the
hepatitis deterioration. The transparent models such as logistic
regression (LR), decision tree (DT)and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) are
picked. While the black-box model such as the eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF) are
selected. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), Local
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Partial Dependence
Plots (PDP) are utilized to improve the model interpretation of liver
disease. The experimental results show that the complex models
outperform the simple ones. The developed RF achieves the highest
accuracy (91.9\%) among all the models. The proposed framework combining
the global and local interpretable methods improves the transparency of
complex models, and gets insight into the judgments from the complex

associated with the behavioral intentions. The structural model
explained a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral
intentions. Likewise, the classifier model suggested that the students'
information management practices and attitudes predicted the behavioral
intentions. Further, the applied algorithms predicted the behavioral
intentions with an accuracy of more than 72\% in most cases. Thereby,
the study extended an original theory (TRA) into the MCC area by using a

article,"Perception of university students towards the use of artificial
intelligence-generated voice in explainer videos","Explainer videos are on the rise, not just for marketing or sales
purposes to highlight a product or business idea in a compelling and
efficient way, but also as a learning tool to enhance instruction at all
levels of learning. But though videos are increasingly part of education
today, video production can be a time-consuming process, and this can be
a barrier for educators who may not all be well-versed in or able to
dedicate significant amounts of time to the creation of effective,
interesting explainer videos that support their educational content. If
it is possible to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated voices for
voice-overs in explainer videos, this would speed up the video creation
process by allowing the creators to bypass the need to record a human -
whether it is the video's creator or a separate actor - speaking the
lines. This study explores the potential of AI-generated voices in
explainer videos aimed at university students, specifically
investigating students' responses to AI-generated voices by looking at
whether they respond positively to the voice and whether there is any
Uncanny Valley effect of revulsion towards it. The findings are based on
a pilot study for university students, where participants were exposed
to a set of explainer videos using different voice-overs (human voice,
speaker notes app, and an AI-generated voice) and their responses
recorded via a questionnaire with questions modified from Ho and
Macdorman, 2010; Kroger et al., 2019; and Kuhne et al., 2020. The
results show a preference for the more human-like voice-overs and no
substantial negative perception of the AI-generated voices that were
more human-like, indicating that AI-generated voices could potentially
be more widely used in explainer videos at institutions of higher
education.","Kit, Leong Wai and Yuin-Y, Chew and Zulkifli, Balqis and Nie, Kho Suet",AI voice; e-learning; explainer video; voice-over; voice characteristics,No data,2023,13

article,"Artificial Intelligence-Powered Smartphone App to Facilitate Medication
Adherence: Protocol for a Human Factors Design Study","Background: Medication Guides consisting of crucial interactions and
side effects are extensive and complex. Due to the exhaustive
information, patients do not retain the necessary medication
information, which can result in hospitalizations and medication
nonadherence. A gap exists in understanding patients' cognition of
managing complex medication information. However, advancements in
technology and artificial intelligence (AI) allow us to understand
patient cognitive processes to design an app to better provide important
medication information to patients.
Objective: Our objective is to improve the design of an innovative AI-
and human factor-based interface that supports patients' medication
information comprehension that could potentially improve medication
adherence.
Methods: This study has three aims. Aim 1 has three phases: (1) an
observational study to understand patient perception of fear and biases
regarding medication information, (2) an eye-tracking study to
understand the attention locus for medication information, and (3) a
psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm study to understand
functionalities. Observational data will be collected, such as audio and
video recordings, gaze mapping, and time from PRP. A total of 50
patients, aged 18-65 years, who started at least one new medication, for
which we developed visualization information, and who have a cognitive
status of 34 during cognitive screening using the TICS-M test and health
literacy level will be included in this aim of the study. In Aim 2, we
will iteratively design and evaluate an AI-powered medication
information visualization interface as a smartphone app with the
knowledge gained from each component of Aim 1. The interface will be
assessed through two usability surveys. A total of 300 patients, aged
18-65 years, with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or mental health
disorders, will be recruited for the surveys. Data from the surveys will
be analyzed through exploratory factor analysis. In Aim 3, in order to
test the prototype, there will be a two-arm study design. This aim will
include 900 patients, aged 18-65 years, with internet access, without
any cognitive impairment, and with at least two medications. Patients
will be sequentially randomized. Three surveys will be used to assess
the primary outcome of medication information comprehension and the
secondary outcome of medication adherence at 12 weeks.
Results: Preliminary data collection will be conducted in 2021, and
results are expected to be published in 2022.
Conclusions: This study will lead the future of AI-based, innovative,
digital interface design and aid in improving medication comprehension,
which may improve medication adherence. The results from this study will
also open up future research opportunities in understanding how patients

algorithm for CT on image quality and potential dose reduction: A
phantom study","Background Recently, computed tomography (CT) manufacturers have
developed deep-learning-based reconstruction algorithms to compensate
for the limitations of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms, such as
image smoothing and the spatial resolution's dependence on contrast and
dose levels. Purpose To assess the impact of an artificial intelligence
deep-learning reconstruction (AI-DLR) algorithm on image quality and
dose reduction compared with a hybrid IR algorithm in chest CT for
different clinical indications. Methods Acquisitions on the CT American
College of Radiology (ACR) 464 and CT Torso CTU-41 phantoms were
performed at five dose levels (CTDIvol: 9.5/7.5/6/2.5/0.4 mGy) used for
chest CT conditions. Raw data were reconstructed using filtered
backprojection, two levels of IR (iDose(4) levels 4 (i4) and 7 (i7)),
and five levels of AI-DLR (Precise Image; Smoother, Smooth, Standard,
Sharp, Sharper). Noise power spectrum (NPS), task-based transfer
function, and detectability index (d `) were computed: d `-modeled
detection of a soft tissue mediastinal nodule (low-contrast soft tissue
chest nodule within the mediastinum {[}LCN]), ground-glass opacity
(GGO), or high-contrast pulmonary (HCP) lesion. The subjective image
quality of chest anthropomorphic phantom images was independently
evaluated by two radiologists. They assessed image noise, image
smoothing, contrast between vessels and fat in the mediastinum for
mediastinal images, visual border detection between bronchus and lung
parenchyma for parenchymal images, and overall image quality using a
commonly used four- or five-point scale. Results From Standard to
Smoother levels, on average, the noise magnitude decreased (for all dose
levels: -66.3\% +/- 0.5\% for mediastinal images and -63.1\% +/- 0.1\%
for parenchymal images), the average NPS spatial frequency decreased
(for all dose levels: -35.3\% +/- 2.2\% for mediastinal images and
-13.3\% +/- 2.2\% for parenchymal images), and the detectability (d `)
of the three lesions increased. The opposite pattern was found from
Standard to Sharper levels. From Smoother to Sharper levels, the spatial
resolution increased for the low-contrast polyethylene insert and the
opposite for the high-contrast air insert. Compared to the i4 used in
clinical practice, d ` values were higher using Smoother (mean for all
dose levels: 338.7\% +/- 29.4\%), Smooth (103.4\% +/- 11.2\%), and
Standard (34.1\% +/- 6.6\%) levels for the LCN on mediastinal images and
Smoother (169.5\% +/- 53.2\% for GGO and 136.9\% +/- 1.6\% for HCP) and
Smooth (36.4\% +/- 22.1\% and 24.1\% +/- 0.9\%, respectively) levels for
parenchymal images. Radiologists considered the images satisfactory for
clinical use at these levels, but adaptation to the dose level of the
protocol is required. Conclusion With AI-DLR, the smoothest levels
reduced the noise and improved the detectability of chest lesions but
increased the image smoothing. The opposite was found with the sharpest
levels. The choice of level depends on the dose level and type of image:
mediastinal or parenchymal.","Greffier, Joel and Si-Mohamed, Salim and Frandon, Julien and Loisy,

communication can be more quickly interactive information transmission,
which greatly facilitates our daily life. However, in the past, wireless
communication is generally large-scale regional information

scenes, people are thinking about whether wireless communication can be
used in closed scenes to do small and fast information transmission. The
purpose of this paper is to study the indoor space layout of university
laboratories based on wireless communication and artificial intelligence
decision-making support. We are looking at the information about
wireless communication to learn that wireless communication was often
used in military transmission of signals and information; it has been
vigorously developed and popularized, is now mainly used for civilian
use, and can be combined with artificial intelligence to implement rapid
information transmission transfer, in the data processing volume at a
certain time basically achieving second transmission. Wireless
communication and artificial intelligence decision-making can be used to
conduct research on the indoor layout of college laboratories. In
response, after data query and data comparison, we applied to the school
for a computer lab and several idle laboratories to cooperate in
experiments to facilitate the completion of the architecture of wireless
communication and artificial intelligence systems, as well as subsequent
data processing analysis. After a period of time of experiments,
according to the results of the experiment, the use of wireless

inproceedings,Automating space allocation in higher education,"The allocation of office space in any large institution is usually a
problematical issue, which often demands a substantial amount of time to
perform manually. The result of this allocation affects the lives of
whoever makes use of the space. In the higher education sector in the
UK, space is becoming an increasingly precious commodity. Student
numbers have risen significantly over the last few years and as a
result, university departments have grown in size. In addition,
universities have come under increasing financial pressure to ensure
that space is utilized as efficiently and effectively as possible.
However, space utilization is only one issue to take into account when
measuring whether or not a particular allocation is of a sufficient high
quality. The problem of space allocation is further complicated by the
fact that no standard procedure is practiced throughout the higher
education sector. Most institutions have their own standards and
requirements, which are often very different to other institutions.
Different levels of authority control the domains of rooms and resources
in different institutions. The most common situation is where a central
university office controls a number of faculties, each managing a number
of departments. This paper will focus specifically on applying
optimization methods to departmental room allocation for non-residential
space in the higher education sector. It will look at the use of three
methods (hill-climbing, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) to
automatically generate solutions to the problem. The processing power of
computers and the repetitive search nature of this problem means that
there is great potential for the automation of this process. The paper
will conclude by discussing and comparing these methods and showing how
they cope with a highly constrained problem.","Burke, EK and Varley, DB",space allocation; hill-climbing; simulated annealing; genetic algorithms,No data,1999,8

response to society's need to preserve and extend the life span of
natural resources. One of the 17 goals of the SD is ``education
quality{''} (Fourth Goal of Sustainable Development {[}SDG-4]).
Education quality is an important goal because education is a powerful
force that can influence social policies and social change. The SDG-4
must be measured in different contexts, and the tools to quantify its
effects require exploration. So, this study aims to propose a
statistical model to measure the impact of higher education online
courses on SD and a structural equation model (SEM) to find constructs
or factors that help us explain a sustainability benefits rate. These
proposed models integrate the three areas of sustainability: social,
economic and environmental. Design/methodology/approach A beta
regression model suggests features that include the academic and
economic opportunities offered by the institution, the involvement in
research activities and the quality of the online courses. A structural
equation modelling (SEM) analysis allowed selecting the key variables
and constructs that are strongly linked to the SD. Findings One of the
key findings showed that the benefit provided by online courses in terms
of SD is 62.99\% higher than that of offline courses in aspects such as
transportation, photocopies, printouts, books, food, clothing, enrolment
fees and connectivity. Research limitations/implications The SEM model
needs large sample sizes to have consistent estimations. Thus, despite
the obtained estimations in the proposed SEM model being reliable, the
authors consider that a limitation of this study was the required time
to collect data corresponding to the estimated sample size.
Originality/value This study proposes two novel and different ways to
estimate the sustainability benefits rate focused on SDG-4, and machine
learning tools are implemented to validate and gain robustness in the
estimations of the beta model. Additionally, the SEM model allows us to
identify new constructs associated with SDG-4.","Luz Arango-Uribe, Marta and Javier Barrera-Causil, Carlos and Pallares,

article,Artificial intelligence extension of the OSCAR-IB criteria,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms have achieved
ambitious aims through automated image pattern recognition. For
neurological disorders, this includes neurodegeneration and
inflammation. Scalable imaging technology for big data in neurology is
optical coherence tomography (OCT). We highlight that OCT changes
observed in the retina, as a window to the brain, are small, requiring
rigorous quality control pipelines. There are existing tools for this
purpose. Firstly, there are human-led validated consensus quality
control criteria (OSCAR-IB) for OCT. Secondly, these criteria are
embedded into OCT reporting guidelines (APOSTEL). The use of the
described annotation of failed OCT scans advances machine learning. This
is illustrated through the present review of the advantages and
disadvantages of AI-based applications to OCT data. The neurological
conditions reviewed here for the use of big data include Alzheimer
disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease, and

article,"E-learning in higher education during COVID-19: evidence from blackboard
learning system","Purpose - The blackboard learning system is an online platform designed
for e-learning employed by higher education institutes like universities
that facilities students to continue learning and educational
activities. This study explores the determinants that affect students'
acceptance and use of Blackboard learning system (BLS) in Pakistan
utilizing the modified UTAUT framework with social isolation as an
additional variable.
Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted, and
the study gathered 494 university students' responses in Pakistan as
participants. The collected data were interpreted applying PLS-SEM
version 3.2.3 software.
Findings - The study's findings exhibited that PE, EE, FC and SI are the
prime determinants influencing the intention and use of BLS in Pakistani
universities. Hedonic motivation and social isolation interact
differently between UTAUT variables and use intention. The results
verify the suitability of the applied theory in the background of the
study.
Research limitations/implications - However, the findings highlight the
present understanding of BLS use from the learners' aspect, but the
study's limitation cannot be evaded. The study respondents belonged to a
specific region of Pakistan (Karachi) that might influence the
usefulness of the outcomes. Other factors categorized as the
environmental, system and organizational elements were not part of the
study that may also differentiate the BLS acceptance. The model was
extended by including the social isolation, but the effect is
insignificant yet positive; therefore, it is required to evaluate the
model differently, such as the organizational aspect, for future
research. Moreover, the ethnic factors that vary in emerging and
developed economies may provide different explanations; therefore, they
can be incorporated in future studies. Likewise, the variables such as
hedonic motivation need to be emphasized more by examining and
evaluating its effect on students' education performance in the future.
Practical implications - The outcome of the study suggests some
implications. At first, being the modified framework UTAUT2 application
makes the collaboration appropriate according to the current phenomena
of the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to the higher education
region to analyze the acceptance of e-learning systems. Educational
institutions within Pakistan would emphasize enhancing students'
accomplishment by improving the interface and the blackboard learning
system workability. Hence, learners' effectiveness in learning would be
escalated; they would be encouraged to accomplish study objectives using
BLS, particularly when they consider it easy to use and a useful
platform for e-learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, enhancing the
e-learning system in the context of the effort demands to be required to
utilize BLS should be the foremost objective as learners would be
motivated to accept the technology if they consider it simple,
convenient, and user-friendly to adopt. Thus, the benefits of using BLS
during this situation when universities are not operational will make
students adaptable to change in the prospect. Learners will accept the
model of online education, even if the universities become operational.
However, it can increase the rate of earnings and revenue for
universities as they can enroll in online and regular classes.
Therefore, it is suggested that higher education management should
create a resilient online platform by which facilitators can communicate
with learners without any obstacles.
Social implications - Hence, it is recommended to introduce the online
short course, qualification, certified courses and integrated coursework
with international ventures and ongoing classes. Numerous learners
continue their studies along with the job. Therefore, it is suggested to
introduce online programs for those learners. Another benefit would be
that it offers an integrated platform for sharing knowledge. BLS offers
to maintain the complete information in one place, and learners can see
them as per their convenience based on their availability. This reduces
the burden on administration related to keeping the educational material
and resource in various files. Thus, it also reduces the expense of
universities. It is suggested to emphasize encouraging the use of BLS
through an effective plan that can assist in execution and help learners
identify the technology features rather than to face difficultly to
accept the change. Moreover, the acceptance of BLS for educational
purposes verifies that other learning events can occur on the online
platform. Thus, it is recommended to promote the origin of the online
atmosphere and the initiation of other events. Globally, dynamics are
changing frequently and continuously and are moving towards artificial
intelligence systems; the circumstances are suitable for promoting
online educational platforms' acceptance by incorporating it with the
current educational arrangement.
Originality/value - The study provides recommendations for the research
to be conducted to explore the modified framework in different regions
and boundaries to evaluate the effect of other factors on adopting
e-learning platforms.","Raza, Syed Ali and Qazi, Zubaida and Qazi, Wasim and Ahmed, Maiyra","Social isolation; Hedonic motivation; Online learning; Blackboard

Using Acoustic Spectroscopy","The pineapple is an essential fruit in Taiwan. Farmers separate
pineapples into two types, according to the percentages of water in the
pineapples. One is the ``drum sound pineapple{''} and the other is the
``meat sound pineapple{''}. As there is more water in the meat sound
pineapple, the meat sound pineapple more easily rots and is more
challenging to store than the drum sound pineapple. Thus, farmers need
to filter out the meat sound pineapple, so that they can sell pineapples
overseas. The classification, based on striking the pineapple fruit with
rigid objects (e.g., plastic rulers) is most commonly used by farmers
due to the negligibly low costs and availability. However, it is a

and diffusion of such technologies, users and human experts must be
provided with explanations and insights by the modules. Another issue is
related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical
data that makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a
new approach for fault detection and diagnosis in rotating machinery is
here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature
extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the
vibration features in the time and frequency domains are extracted.
Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault is verified in
an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The
modularity of the methodology allows different algorithms to be
implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the
feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the
fault diagnosis is performed. Two tools for diagnosis are proposed,

Artificial Intelligence Teaching Environment","Today, English is the world's main international language and is widely
spoken. In this context, the learning of English has long been valued by
all countries. In addition, English plays an essential role in the
process of economic globalization, specifically in the majority of
countries where English is not the native language. At the same time, as
China's integration into the world grows, the importance of English has
become more pronounced, and the demand for English language skills has
increased. At present, China's ever-expanding opening to the outside
world, its developing science and technology, and its rising
international status have created an urgent need for English-speaking
professionals. This will lay the foundation for China's economic and
social development and enable China to play a greater and more active
role in international affairs, which has great practical and
far-reaching historical significance. At present, the traditional
English teaching mode has been criticized due to a great number of
issues. At the same time, the new English language standards and the
change of evaluation methods have created new demands on English
teaching methods. As a result, with the development of artificial
intelligence technology, the application of artificial intelligence
technology in the field of education has brought new directions for the
optimization of English classroom. In addition, diversified network
technologies also provide new support for the realization of intelligent
and collaborative English classroom teaching. To be specific, the
maturity of English intelligent speech synthesis and intelligent speech
evaluation technologies has enabled intelligent technologies to reach or
even surpass the level of human teachers in certain areas. However, due
to the limitations of the market environment and evaluation methods, the
products that can focus on English classroom teaching are not highly
intelligent and less collaborative. What is more, the process of English
classroom intelligence has stagnated compared to other subjects.
Obviously, from the perspective of integrating artificial intelligence
technology with English classroom, it is quite necessary and feasible to
design and develop an intelligent teaching assistant that can be applied
to college English teaching. As information technology continues to
evolve, both national and teacher levels are beginning to focus on how
it can be better used in the teaching of subjects. Therefore, the use of
online information technology in teaching and learning presents a great
opportunity for research and practice in English language learning at
the university level.","Liu, Shaojie",No data,10.1155/2022/3415999,2022,No data

Learning Simulated Surgical Skills Among Medical Students A Randomized
Clinical Trial","IMPORTANCE To better understand the emerging role of artificial
intelligence (AI) in surgical training, efficacy of Al tutoring systems,
such as the Virtual Operative Assistant (VOA), must be tested and
compared with conventional approaches.
OBJECTIVE To determine how VOA and remote expert instruction compare in
learners' skill acquisition, affective, and cognitive outcomes during
surgical simulation training.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This instructor-blinded randomized
clinical trial included medical students (undergraduate years 0-2) from
4 institutions in Canada during a single simulation training at McGill
Neurosurgical Simulation and Artificial Intelligence Learning Centre,
Montreal, Canada. Cross-sectional data were collected from January to
April 2021. Analysis was conducted based on intention-to-treat. Data
were analyzed from April to June 2021.
INTERVENTIONS The interventions included 5 feedback sessions, 5 minutes
each, during a single 75-minute training, including 5 practice sessions
followed by 1 realistic virtual reality brain tumor resection. The 3
intervention arms included 2 treatment groups, AI audiovisual
metric-based feedback (VOA group) and synchronous verbal scripted
debriefing and instruction from a remote expert (instructor group), and
a control group that received no feedback.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The coprimary outcomes were change in
procedural performance, quantified as Expertise Score by a validated
assessment algorithm (Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System
{[}ICEMS]; range, -1.00 to 1.00) for each practice resection, and
learning and retention, measured from performance in realistic
resections by ICEMS and blinded Objective Structured Assessment of
Technical Skills (OSATS; range 1-7). Secondary outcomes included
strength of emotions before, during, and after the intervention and
cognitive load after intervention, measured in self-reports.
RESULTS A total of 70 medical students (41 {[}59\%] women and 29
{[}41\%] men; mean {[}SD] age, 21.8 {[}2.3] years) from 4 institutions
were randomized, including 23 students in the VOA group, 24 students in
the instructor group, and 23 students in the control group. All
participants were included in the final analysis. ICEMS assessed 350
practice resections, and ICEMS and OSATS evaluated 70 realistic
resections. VOA significantly improved practice Expertise Scores by 0.66
(95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.77) points compared with the instructor group and by
0.65 (95\% CI, 0.54 to 0.77) points compared with the control group (P <
.001). Realistic Expertise Scores were significantly higher for the VOA
group compared with instructor (mean difference. 0.53 {[}95\% CI, 0.40
to 0.67] points; P < .001) and control (mean difference. 0.49 {[}95\%
CI, 0.34 to 0.61] points; P < .001) groups. Mean global OSATS ratings
were not statistically significant among the VOA (4.63 {[}95\% CI, 4.06
to 5.20] points), instructor (4.40 {[}95\% CI, 3.88-4.91] points), and
control (3.86 {[}95\% CI, 3.44 to 4.27] points) groups. However, on the
OSATS subscores, VOA significantly enhanced the mean OSATS overall
subscore compared with the control group (mean difference, 1.04 {[}95\%
CI, 0.13 to 1.96] points; P = .02), whereas expert instruction
significantly improved OSATS subscores for instrument handling vs
control (mean difference, 1.18 {[}95\% CI, 0.22 to 2.14]; P = .01). No
significant differences in cognitive load, positive activating, and
negative emotions were found.

for pressure prediction of nanofluid convective flow in a heated pipe","Heat transfer augmentation of the nanofluids is still an attractive
concept for researchers due to rising demands for designing efficient
heat transfer fluids. However, the pressure loss arisen from the
suspension of nanoparticles in liquid is known as a drawback for
developing such novel fluids. Therefore, prediction of the nanofluid
pressure, especially in internal flows, has been focused on studies.
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a commonly used approach for such
a prediction of fluid flow. The CFD tools are perfect and precise in
prediction of the fluid flow parameters. But they might be
time-consuming and expensive, especially for complex models such as
3-dimension modeling and turbulent flow. In addition, the CFD could just
predict the pressure, and it is disabled for finding the relationship of
such variables. This study is intended to show the performance of the
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm as an auxiliary method for
cooperation with the CFD. The turbulent flow of Cu/water nanofluid
warming up in a pipe is considered as a sample of a physical phenomenon.
The AI algorithm learns the CFD results. Then, the relation between the
CFD results is discovered by the AI algorithm. For this purpose, the
adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is adopted as AI
tool. The intelligence condition of the ANFIS is checked by benchmarking
the CFD results. The paper outcomes indicated that the ANFIS
intelligence is met by employing gauss2mf in the model as the membership
function and x, y, and z coordinates, the nanoparticle volume fraction,
and the temperature as the inputs. The pressure predicted by the ANFIS
at this condition is the same as that predicted by the CFD. The
artificial intelligence of ANFIS could find the relation of the
nanofluid pressure to the nanoparticle fraction and the temperature. The
CFD simulation took much more time (90-110 min) than the total time of
the learning and the prediction of the ANFIS (369 s). The CFD modeling
was done on a workstation computer, while the ANFIS method was run on a

Intelligence and Human Experts in Clinical Diagnosis: Retrospective
Cohort and Survey Study","Background: Deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence may have
different diagnostic characteristics than human experts in medical
diagnosis. As a data-driven knowledge system, heterogeneous population
incidence in the clinical world is considered to cause more bias to DL
than clinicians. Conversely, by experiencing limited numbers of cases,
human experts may exhibit large interindividual variability. Thus,
understanding how the 2 groups classify given data differently is an
essential step for the cooperative usage of DL in clinical application.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the differential
effects of clinical experience in otoendoscopic image diagnosis in both
computers and physicians exemplified by the class imbalance problem and
guide clinicians when utilizing decision support systems. Methods: We
used digital otoendoscopic images of patients who visited the outpatient
clinic in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Severance Hospital,
Seoul, South Korea, from January 2013 to June 2019, for a total of
22,707 otoendoscopic images. We excluded similar images, and 7500
otoendoscopic images were selected for labeling. We built a DL-based
image classification model to classify the given image into 6 disease
categories. Two test sets of 300 images were populated: balanced and
imbalanced test sets. We included 14 clinicians (otolaryngologists and
nonotolaryngology specialists including general practitioners) and 13
DL-based models. We used accuracy (overall and per-class) and kappa
statistics to compare the results of individual physicians and the ML
models. Results: Our ML models had consistently high accuracies
(balanced test set: mean 77.14\%, SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean
82.03\%, SD 3.06\%), equivalent to those of otolaryngologists (balanced:
mean 71.17\%, SD 3.37\%; imbalanced: mean 72.84\%, SD 6.41\%) and far
better than those of nonotolaryngologists (balanced: mean 45.63\%, SD
7.89\%; imbalanced: mean 44.08\%, SD 15.83\%). However, ML models
suffered from class imbalance problems (balanced test set: mean 77.14\%,
SD 1.83\%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03\%, SD 3.06\%). This was
mitigated by data augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes,
but rare disease classes still had low per-class accuracies. Human
physicians, despite being less affected by prevalence, showed high
interphysician variability (ML models: kappa=0.83, SD 0.02;
otolaryngologists: kappa=0.60, SD 0.07). Conclusions: Even though ML
models deliver excellent performance in classifying ear disease,
physicians and ML models have their own strengths. ML models have
consistent and high accuracy while considering only the given image and
show bias toward prevalence, whereas human physicians have varying
performance but do not show bias toward prevalence and may also consider
extra information that is not images. To deliver the best patient care
in the shortage of otolaryngologists, our ML model can serve a
cooperative role for clinicians with diverse expertise, as long as it is
kept in mind that models consider only images and could be biased toward
prevalent diseases even after data augmentation.","Cha, Dongchul and Pae, Chongwon and Lee, Se A. and Na, Gina and Hur,

the integration and application of moral education resources in
ideological and political textbooks. Political classrooms provide
favorable support for the integration and application of moral education
resources, and political classrooms have become a practical carrier for
the integration and application of moral education resources. And then
it introduces the artificial intelligence model algorithm-artificial
neural network algorithm. Artificial intelligence is a new intelligent
machine that can make intelligent responses similar to human actions
according to human actions. Finally, it studies the use of social
teaching resources for ideological and political education in city A and
conducts a comprehensive analysis on the integration and utilization of
moral education teaching resources for ideological and political courses
in colleges and universities. In the survey of ``Whether the
introduction of local social resources in the political class of city A
is helpful to students' learning,{''} 84 teachers thought it was very
helpful, 12 teachers thought it was helpful, and only 3 teachers thought
it was not helpful. It can be found that most teachers think that it is
helpful for students to introduce social resources in political lessons.
At the same time, in order to better improve the reliability and
validity of moral resources and to internalize social moral norms into
students' hearts, it is only by combining moral resources with students'
moral growth.","Ding, Peifen and Huang, Xiang",No data,10.1155/2022/2149733,2022,No data

higher education blended-learning environment","Learning Management Systems (LMSs) under blended (b-) learning modality
can efficiently support Online Learning Environments (OLEs) at Higher
Education Institutions (HEIs). Mining of LMS users' data, involving
artificial intelligence and incertitude modeling, e.g., via fuzzy logic,
is a fundamental challenge. This study addresses the hypothesis that the
structural characteristics of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) can
efficiently model the way LMS users interact with it, by estimating
their Quality of Interaction (QoI) within a b-learning context. This
study introduces the FCM-QoI model (combined with a model visualizer)
consisting of 14 input-one output concepts, dependences and trends,
considering one academic year of the LMS use from 75 professors and 1037
students at a HEI. The experimental findings have shown that the
proposed FCM-QoI model can provide concepts interconnection and causal
dependencies representation of Moodie LMS users' QoI, revealing
perspectives of its evolution both at a micro and macro analysis level.
Moreover, the FCM-QoI model significantly adds to the evaluation and
analysis of the QoI influential concepts' contribution to self-sustained
cycles (static analysis) and their alterations, when the time period of
the LMS use is considered (dynamic analysis), showing potential to
increase the flexibility and adaptivity of the QoI modeling and feedback
approaches. Clearly, based on the FCM-QoI model, pedagogical instructors

article,"Threefold Optimized Forecasting of Electricity Consumption in Higher
Education Institutions","Energy management benefits both consumers and utility companies alike.
Utility companies remain interested in identifying and reducing energy
waste and theft, whereas consumers' interest remain in lowering their
energy expenses. A large supply-demand gap of over 6 GW exists in
Pakistan as reported in 2018. Reducing this gap from the supply side is
an expensive and complex task. However, efficient energy management and
distribution on demand side has potential to reduce this gap
economically. Electricity load forecasting models are increasingly used
by energy managers in taking real-time tactical decisions to ensure
efficient use of resources. Advancement in Machine-learning (ML)
technology has enabled accurate forecasting of electricity consumption.
However, the impact of computation cost afforded by these ML models is
often ignored in favour of accuracy. This study considers both accuracy
and computation cost as concurrently significant factors because
together they shape the technology environment as well as create
economic impact. Thus, a three-fold optimized load forecasting model is
proposed which includes (1) application specific parameters selection,
(2) impact of different dataset granularities and (3) implementation of
specific data preparation. It deploys and compares the widely used
back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF)
models for the prediction of electricity consumption of buildings within
a university. In addition to the temporal and historical power
consumption date as input parameters, the study also embeds weather data
as well as university operational calendars resulting in improved
performance. The outcomes are indicative that the granularity i.e. the
scale of details in data, and set of reduced and full input parameters
impact performance accuracies differently forANNandRF models.

the roll-out of machine learning techniques in the research field by
developing large databases, benchmarks, and representations for chemical
applications and new machine learning frameworks. Machine learning has
significant advantages over traditional modeling techniques, including
flexibility, accuracy, and execution speed. These strengths also come
with weaknesses, such as the lack of interpretability of these black-box
models. The greatest opportunities involve using machine learning in
time-limited applications such as real-time optimization and planning
that require high accuracy and that can build on models with a
self-learning ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become
more intelligent over time. The greatest threat in artificial

the Education System","Taking the entire education system in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province,
Central China, as an example, this paper uses the questionnaire survey
method to analyze the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on role
cognition in the education system. The education system targeted by this
questionnaire survey involves 8 categories: preschool education, primary
education, secondary education, higher education, adult education,
computer network education, enterprise education, and social education;
the respondents include 368 teachers, 402 students or learners, 118
school managers, and 124 family members of students or learners in all
above education categories. The questionnaire design has a total of 34
question classified into 6 role cognition items, with a 5-level score; a
total of 1012 questionnaires were distributed, and 978 were recovered
with a recovery rate of 96.64\%, in which 957 were valid questionnaires
with an effective rate of 97.85\%. The study results show that the
learning of AI-assisted courses is strongly dependent on course role
cognition, and the construction of role cognition is related to the
understanding of course content, teaching methods, and activity methods.
Therefore, the effect of AI on role cognition in the education system
needs to be systematically analyzed from the aspects of function
realization form, resource presentation method, supporting hardware
form, teacher-student interaction method, and representation method of
works. As connecters, teacher's role cognition is limited by the degree
of understanding learners, the amount of resources, and data processing
capabilities, but the advantage is that they can flexibly monitor and
adjust. AI technology is flexible and diverse, it functions in learning
and teaching activities in a variety of ways, and there is no agreement
on the terminology to describe its role in role recognition. The results
of this paper provide a reference for further researches on the effect

Adrenocortical Carcinoma and Adenoma Established by Artificial
Intelligence","Simple Summary The histological differential diagnosis of adrenocortical
adenoma and carcinoma is difficult and requires great expertise. MiRNAs
were shown to be useful for the differential diagnosis of benign and
malignant tumors of several organs, and several findings have suggested
their utility in adrenocortical tumors as well. Here, we have selected
tissue miRNAs based on the literature search, and used machine learning
to identify novel clinically applicable miRNA combinations. Combinations
with high sensitivity and specificity (both over 90\%) have been
identified that could be promising for clinical use. Besides being a
useful adjunct to histological examination, these miRNA combinations
could enable preoperative adrenal biopsy in patients with adrenal tumors
suspicious for malignancy. The histological analysis of adrenal tumors
is difficult and requires great expertise. Tissue microRNA (miRNA)
expression is distinct between benign and malignant tumors of several
organs and can be useful for diagnostic purposes. MiRNAs are stable and
their expression can be reliably reproduced from archived
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks. Our purpose was
to assess the potential applicability of combinations of
literature-based miRNAs as markers of adrenocortical malignancy.
Archived FFPE tissue samples from 10 adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), 10
adrenocortical adenoma (ACA) and 10 normal adrenal cortex samples were
analyzed in a discovery cohort, while 21 ACC and 22 ACA patients were
studied in a blind manner in the validation cohort. The expression of
miRNA was determined by RT-qPCR. Machine learning and neural
network-based methods were used to find the best performing miRNA
combination models. To evaluate diagnostic applicability, ROC-analysis
was performed. We have identified three miRNA combinations (hsa-miR-195

hsa-miR-210 + hsa-miR-483-5p + hsa-miR-503) as unexpectedly good
predictors to determine adrenocortical malignancy with sensitivity and
specificity both of over 90\%. These miRNA panels can supplement the
histological examination of removed tumors and could even be performed
from small volume adrenal biopsy samples preoperatively.","Turai, Peter Istvan and Herold, Zoltan and Nyiro, Gabor and Borka,

radiotherapy treatment planning and dose optimisation","Introduction: The aim of this review is to describe how various
AI-supported applications are used in head and neck cancer radiotherapy
treatment planning, and the impact on dose management in regards to
target volume and nearby organs at risk (OARs).
Methods: Literature searches were conducted in databases and publisher
portals Pubmed, Science Direct, CINAHL, Ovid, and ProQuest to peer
reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2021. Results: Out of 464
potential ones, ten articles covering the topic were selected. The
benefit of using deep learning-based methods to automatically segment
OARs is that it makes the process more efficient producing clinically
acceptable OAR doses. In some cases automated treatment planning systems
can outperform traditional systems in dose prediction.
Conclusions: Based on the selected articles, in general AI-based systems
produced time savings. Also, AI-based solutions perform at the same
level or better than traditional planning systems considering
auto-segmentation, treatment planning and dose prediction. However,
their clinical implementation into routine standard of care should be
carefully validated
Implications to practice: AI has a primary benefit in reducing treatment
planning time and improving plan quality allowing dose reduction to the
OARs thereby enhancing patients' quality of life. It has a secondary
benefit of reducing radiation therapists' time spent annotating thereby
saving their time for e.g. patient encounters. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

as Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for
Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis, Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials, and the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging
is increasing to improve the peer-review process and reporting of AI
tools. However, no such standards exist for product-level review.
Methods: A review of clinical trials showed a paucity of evidence for
radiology AI products; thus, the authors developed a 10-question
assessment tool for reviewing AI products with an emphasis on their
validation and result dissemination. The assessment tool was applied to
commercial and open-source algorithms used for diagnosis to extract
evidence on the clinical utility of the tools.
Results: There is limited technical information on methodologies for
FDA-approved algorithms compared with open-source products, likely
because of intellectual property concerns. Furthermore, FDA-approved
products use much smaller data sets compared with opensource AI tools,
because the terms of use of public data sets are limited to academic and
noncommercial entities, which precludes their use in commercial
products.

in present and future education at all levels, a fact that has been
particularly and hugely enhanced and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic
situation, thereby facilitating and fostering distance learning. This is
very much connected to the application of AI to higher education,
another unavoidable issue of utmost importance for the university of the
future. While these technological advances present a challenge to
universities, which must determine which are necessary and desirable and
how to implement them, it is, ultimately, our responsibility to use
them, in an ethical way, to the benefit of our students. The university
of the future also has to be of high quality, and this involves carrying
out important and decisive action having to do with matters of
inclusion, hiring policies and the expansion of international
opportunities for all parties involved. Originality/value - This paper
outlines the main ideas in connection with what the author conceives to
be the university of the future, a university that should not only
educate people within the university system but also prepare them to
fill specific job positions at both local and global levels, apart from
necessarily providing them with the critical thinking and competences in
autonomous learning that will make them flexible and capable of adapting
to the job market and to a fast-changing world in general. Moreover, the
role of new technologies (especially the impact of AI), quality and
internationalization are also discussed as relevant factors in this view
of the university of the future.","Mairal, Ricardo","Employment; Internationalization; Higher education; Quality; Artificial

of mortality in hospitals(1-3), but the best treatment strategy remains
uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in

treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a
large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was
lowest in patients for whom clinicians' actual doses matched the AI

combination to diagnose breast cancer using ultrasonography, results
from multi-center cohorts","Purpose: To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model for the
classification of breast lesions on ul-trasound images.Method: In the
present study, three separate data cohorts containing 1288 breast
lesions from three countries (Malaysia, Iran, and Turkey) were utilized
for MLmodel development and external validation. The model was trained
on ultrasound images of 725 breast lesions, and validation was done
separately on the remaining data. An expert radiologist and a radiology
resident classified the lesions based on the BI-RADS lexicon. Thirteen
morphometric features were selected from a contour of the lesion and
underwent a three-step feature selection process. Five features were
chosen to be fed into the model separately and combined with the imaging
signs mentioned in the BI-RADS reference guide. A support vector
classifier was trained and optimized.Results: The diagnostic profile of
the model with various input data was compared to the expert radiologist
and radiology resident. The agreement of each approach with
histopathologic specimens was also determined. Based on BI-RADS and
morphometric features, the model achieved an area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.885, which is higher
than the expert radiologist and radiology resident performances with AUC
of 0.814 and 0.632, respectively in all cohorts. DeLong's test also
showed that the AUC of the ML protocol was significantly different from

This paper uses the modular development method to achieve the functional
requirements of the system as the goal, respectively, for parameter
management, website configuration, system log, interface security
settings, SMS configuration, WeChat template message and several
functional modules to achieve system configuration. In this paper, three
types of sensors are used to analyze the data changes in the process of
walking through three types of data, and different weights are given as
the results of step-counting. When the peak value of sensor data is
measured, only the peak value of the primary axial data of each sensor
is analyzed, which should be determined according to the actual axial
value of the sensor. In this paper, the users' evaluation indexes of
sports fitness app are divided into two groups: importance and
satisfaction, so the obtained data are directly divided into two groups:
importance and satisfaction of user experience indexes of sports fitness
app, and the two groups of data are matched with the sample t test to
ensure the scientific conclusion. Finally, the advantages and
disadvantages of the user experience of college students' sports fitness
app are analyzed through IPA analysis. Heuristic evaluation is carried
out on the step app to score the second-level usability index of the
app. The first-level usability index score and the total usability score
of the step app are obtained by calculation. There is not much
difference between male and female students who use sports apps. Among
them, 288 are male students, accounting for 58.2\% of the total and

inhibiting and motivating factors underlying the adoption of AI based
teaching and learning solutions by teachers in the higher education
sector of India.
Background AI based teaching and learning solutions are amongst the most
important educational innovations. The intervention of AI in
instructional methods can result in personalized teaching and learning
experiences. AI enabled teaching and learning systems can give teachers
a better understanding regarding their students' learning abilities,
learning styles and progress.
Methodology The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to find the
relative importance of inhibiting and motivating factors. The primary
data for making the pair-wise comparisons between the factors were
obtained from a convenient sample of 32 teachers, teaching in various
higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the National Capital Region
(NCR) of Delhi, India.
Contribution Though, the acceptance of AI based solutions has been
studied in other contexts such as retail, banking, ecommerce, and so on;
nonetheless, the acceptance of AI in the education sector has not
grabbed much attention of researchers. Hence the study has made
worthwhile contributions to the literature as it has specifically
focused on the adoption of AI based teaching methods by teachers in
higher education
Findings The findings suggest that institutional barriers are the major
inhibitors and recognition is the main motivator that affect teachers'
behaviour towards adopting AI based teaching solutions. Overall, the
findings of the study highlight the importance of institutional support
in terms of resources, time, and recognition that may be provided to the
teachers so that they can willingly integrate AI based methodologies
into their teaching.
Recommendations for Practitioners The study provides several
implications for HEIs and developers of AI based educational solutions.
The HEIs should provide adequate support to their teachers in terms of
financial support, infrastructure and technical support. The developers
should focus on developing such solutions that are compatible with the
teachers' existing work style.
Recommendations for Researchers Future studies can employ statistical
techniques such as multiple regression analysis or structural equation
modelling to examine the impact of these factors on the actual use
behaviour of teachers regarding AI based teaching methods. More
diversified samples that are statistically significant in size, can be
considered to examine the teachers' behaviour regarding AI based
instructional methods.
Impact on Society AI technology can play a pivotal role in reshaping and
remodeling higher education. AI is the technology of todays' times that
has the capability of transforming the instructional methods. The
educators need to understand that nowadays, teaching and learning are
heading towards creative styles that embrace the use of innovative
technologies such as AI.
Future Research The adoption of AI in the field of education is at a
very nascent stage in India, constant changes are likely to happen in
the factors influencing the adoption of AI enabled teaching solutions.
Future studies may come up with a more holistic model of factors to
address this research problem.","Gupta, Kriti Priya and Bhaskar, Preeti","artificial intelligence (AI); adoption; higher education; teachers;

mortality and the Jaccard similarity with clinicians' decisions. We used
a random forest algorithm to calculate the feature importance of both
the clinician policy and the AI policy to illustrate the
interpretability of the AI model. Results Our experimental study
demonstrated that the AI model could help reduce the estimated
in-hospital mortality through its RL function and learn the best
practice from clinicians through its SL function. The similarity between
the clinician policy and the AI policy regarding the surviving patients
was high, while for the expired patients, it was much lower. The dynamic
treatment strategies made by the AI model were clinically interpretable
and relied on sensible clinical features extracted according to
monitoring indexes and risk factors for CHD patients. Conclusions We
proposed a pipeline for constructing an AI model to learn dynamic
treatment strategies for CHD patients that could improve patient
outcomes and mimic the best practices of clinicians. And a lot of
further studies and efforts are needed to make it practical.","Guo, Haihong and Li, Jiao and Liu, Hongyan and He, Jun","Dynamic treatment strategies; Coronary heart diseases; Artificial

THEIR LEARNING PROCESS","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the educational landscape of
institutions of higher education, which were predominantly face-to-face.
In Malaysia, many universities converted their courses into online
courses to keep up with the challenges of working from home during the
pandemic, using web technologies and blended learning approaches.
However, there are challenges in ensuring students' attention and
retention rates are maintained and enough support and scaffolding are
provided to them when they are learning online. As such, the MERLIN
Project was undertaken to develop a virtual learning assistant that
would provide online support to students outside of their online
classes. The project used Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology with
Natural Language Processing (NLP) features to develop a chatbot that
simulated human-like conversation between chatbot and students. Content
in the learning environment was media-rich and mapped to Mayer's 12
Multimedia Learning Principles. Data from 102 students was collected to
gauge their perceptions and feedback. Results showed that students found
the chatbot to be helpful in their learning process and improved their

from cognitive normal (CN), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from mild
cognitive impairment (MCI). The objectives are to compare the models and
identify whether radiomics or volumetry can provide a better prediction
for differentiating different types of dementia. Method: 582 MRI
T1-weighted images were retrieved from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, which is a multicenter
operating open source database for AD. In total, 97 images of AD, 293
images of MCI patient and 192 images of cognitive normal were divided
into a training, a validation and a test group at a ratio of 70:15:15.
For each T1-weighted image, volumetric segmentation was performed with
the image analysis software FreeSurfer, and radiomics features were
retrieved by imaging research software 3D slicers. Brain regional volume
and radiomics features were used to build the V-model and R-model,
respectively, using the random forest algorithm by R. The receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) curve of both models were used to
evaluate their diagnostic accuracy and reliability to differentiate AD,
MCI and CN. Results: To differentiate MCI and CN, both V-model and
R-model achieved excellent performance, with an AUC of 0.9992 +/- 0.0022
and 0.9850 +/- 0.0032, respectively. No significant difference was found
between the two AUCs, indicating both models attained similar good
performance. In MCI and AD differentiation, the V-model and R-model
yielded AUC of 0.9986 +/- 0.0013 and 0.9714 +/- 0.0175, respectively.
The best performance was to differentiate AD from CN, where the V-model
and R-model yielded AUC of 0.9994 +/- 0.0019 and 0.9830 +/- 0.009,

approaches could be used in differentiating AD, MCI and CN, based on T1
weighted MR images using random forest algorithm successfully.
Conclusion: This study showed that the radiomics features from
T1-weighted MR images achieved excellence performance in differentiating
AD, MCI and CN. Compared to the volumetry method, the accuracy,
sensitivity and specificity are slightly lower in using radiomics, but
still attained very good and reliable classification of the three stages

education in colleges and universities, it can be said that every major
change in it has an important relationship with the changes in the
social background. Under the background of the rapid development of
wireless communication and artificial intelligence technology at this
stage, legal education in colleges and universities has also ushered in
a new opportunity for upgrading. The purpose of this paper is at
studying the realization path of legal education reform in colleges and
universities based on the background of the new era. To consolidate the
achievements in this field through active reform and to solve the main
problems by constructing an optimized teaching system, in the selection
of the survey method, the research uses the questionnaire survey method
as the main source of data. According to the questionnaire, 60\% of the
students indicated that they would take the initiative to study and
continue to try new assessment methods to adapt to the autonomous
learning of the law. Teachers should try their best to let students
fully experience law teaching under wireless communication and AI in
their usual teaching.","Wu, Junyan and Tang, Wenjun",No data,10.1155/2022/2574911,2022,No data

article,"Digital Media Teaching and Effectiveness Evaluation Integrating Big Data
and Artificial Intelligence","With the development of digital media technology, its application in
teaching and learning is becoming more widespread. Digital media
technology helps present information in transmitting knowledge or

Evaluation of the effectiveness of digital media teaching has also
become important. A scientific and reasonable evaluation of digital
media teaching effectiveness can help teachers select digital media
technology and grasp the amount, degree, and timing of digital media use
to change teaching effectiveness. This paper proposed using a
combination of big data and artificial intelligence methods to evaluate
the effectiveness of digital media teaching methods using the RBF neural
network model. The digital media teaching effectiveness evaluation was
used as the input variable of RBF, the degree of digital media
effectiveness was the output variable and the neural network was trained
through the collected sample data. The research results showed that the
RBF neural network model proposed in this paper has a strong

to Assess Prevalence and Improve Quality Improvement Opportunities","Purpose: Incidental pulmonary embolism (IPE) can be found on body CT.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using
artificial intelligence to identify missed IPE on a large number of CT
examinations. Methods: This retrospective analysis included all
single-phase chest, abdominal, and pelvic (CAP) and abdominal and pelvic
(AP) CT examinations performed at a single center over 1 year, for
indications other than identification of PE. Proprietary visual
classification and natural language processing software was used to
analyze images and reports from all CT examinations, followed by a
two-step human adjudication process to classify cases as true positive,
false positive, true negative, or false negative. Descriptive statistics
were assessed for prevalence of IPE and features (sub segmental versus
central, unifocal versus multifocal, right heart strain or not) of
missed IPE. Interrater agreement for radiologist readers was also
calculated. Results: A total of 11,913 CT examinations (6,398 CAP, 5,515
AP) were included. Thirty false-negative examinations were identified on
CAP (0.47\%; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.32\%-0.67\%) and
nineteen false-negative studies on AP (0.34\%; 95\% CI, 0.21\%-0.54\%)
studies. During manual review, readers showed substantial agreement for
identification of IPE on CAP (K = 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.86) and nearly
perfect agreement for identification of IPE on AP (K = 0.86; 95\% CI,
0.76-0.97). Forty-nine missed IPEs (0.41\%; 95\% CI, 0.30\%0.54\%) were
ultimately identified, compared with seventy-nine IPEs (0.66\%; 95\% CI,
0.53\%-0.83\%) identified at initial clinical interpretation.
Conclusions: Artificial intelligence can efficiently analyze CT
examinations to identify potential missed IPE. These results can inform
peer-review efforts and quality control and could potentially be
implemented in a prospective fashion.\& nbsp; J Am Coll Radiol

Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Civic Education","A logical and appropriate job advising system for college students is
the only way to address the current dire work scenario for recent
graduates in a society that is becoming more and more competitive. The
process of building new career advice systems for college students is
still fraught with many major issues. Existing problems are manifested
in the lack of a perfect employment guidance system for college students
and a lack of effective ideological and political education, which leads
to the inability of college students to establish a correct employment
concept. At the same time, the recommendation method used in the current
college student employment guidance system is not reasonable enough and
only considers students' one-way preference for employment units. Then,
the history of one user's employment is likely to lead to unreliable
negative samples, which affects the recommendation performance. In
addition, the current employment recommendation system cannot fully
integrate the service function, management function, education function,
and research function of the employment guidance system. In this paper,
we address the aforementioned issues and propose an unique career
counseling system for college students by combining algorithmic
recommendation with ideological and political education. The system
adaptively aggregates the preferences and needs of students and
employers and fully integrates several functions of the student career
competence and career guidance system. The experimental results show
that the establishment of a college students' employment guidance system
integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and civic education not only
has better interpretability compared with the traditional employment
guidance system but also has a higher area under curve (AUC).
Furthermore, we also discuss the importance of ideological and political
education and referral systems in the work of the career guidance system
through ablation experiments. The results show that the AUC values of
integrating ideological and political education and recommender systems
were higher than those of integrating only ideological and political
education or recommender systems. Therefore, establishing an employment
guidance system for college students that integrates AI and civic
education can effectively guide students' employment. At the same time,
the college student employment guidance system proposed in this paper
can offer employment guidance courses in colleges and universities, help
graduates to solve their doubts, and make graduates adjust their

study proposed an end-to-end air quality predictive model for smart city
applications, utilizing four machine learning techniques and two deep
learning techniques. These include Ada Boost, SVR, RF, KNN, MLP
regressor and LSTM. The study was conducted in four different urban
cities in Selangor, Malaysia, including Petaling Jaya, Banting, Klang,
and Shah Alam. The model considered the air qual-ity data of various
pollution markers such as PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO. Additionally,
meteorological data including wind speed and wind direction were also
considered, and their interactions with the pollutant markers were
quantified. The study aimed to determine the correlation variance of the
dependent variable in predicting air pol-lution and proposed a feature
optimization process to reduce dimensionality and re-move irrelevant
features to enhance the prediction of PM2.5, improving the existing LSTM
model. The study estimates the concentration of pollutants in the air
based on training and highlights the contribution of feature
optimization in air quality predic-tions through feature dimension
reductions. Results. In this section, the results of predicting the
concentration of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO) in the air are
presented in R2 and RMSE. In predicting the PM10 and PM2.5
concentration, LSTM performed the best overall high R2 values in the
four study areas with the R2 values of 0.998, 0.995, 0.918, and 0.993 in
Banting, Petaling, Klang and Shah Alam stations, respectively. The study
indicated that among the studied pollution markers, PM2.5, PM10, NO2,
wind speed and humidity are the most important elements to monitor. By
reducing the number of features used in the model the proposed feature
optimization process can make the model more interpretable and provide
insights into the most critical factor affecting air quality. Findings
from this study can aid policymakers in understanding the underlying
causes of air pollution and develop more effective smart strategies for

education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online
quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted
over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information,
participants' perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI
and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential
statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results:
A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64\% correctly
identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer
(37\%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and
deep learning. The majority of participants (83\%) agreed they were

remained amongst 29\%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with
only 8\% of participants having received AI teachings in their
pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes
towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may
stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI

article,"Computer-assisted EFL writing and evaluations based on artificial
intelligence: a case from a college reading and writing course","Purpose The aim of this study is to explore students' expectations and
perceived effectiveness of computer-assisted review tools, and the
differences in reliability and validity between human evaluation and
automatic evaluation, to find a way to improve students' English writing
ability. Design/methodology/approach Based on the expectancy
disconfirmation theory (EDT) and Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language
Learning (ICALL) theory, an experiment is conducted through the
observation method, semistructured interview method and questionnaire
survey method. In the experiment, respondents were asked to write and
submit four essays on three online automated essay evaluation (AEE)
systems in total, one essay every two weeks. Also, two teacher raters
were invited to score the first and last papers of each student. The
respondents' feedbacks were investigated to confirm the effectiveness of
the AEE system; the evaluation results of the AEE systems and teachers
were compared; descriptive statistics was used to analyze the
experimental data. Findings The experiment revealed that the respondents
held high expectations for the computer-assisted evaluation tools, and
the effectiveness of computer scoring feedback on students was higher
than that of teacher scoring feedback. Moreover, at the end of the
writing project, the students' independent learning ability and English
writing ability were significantly improved. Besides, there was a
positive correlation between students' initial expectations of
computer-assisted learning tools and the final evaluation of learning
results. Originality/value The innovation lies in the use of observation
methods, questionnaire survey methods, data analysis, and other methods
for the experiment, and the combination of deep learning theory, EDT and
descriptive statistics, which has particular reference value for future
works.","Wang, Zhijie","Computer-assisted writing; Learner expectation and satisfaction;

article,"The impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on practices, policies and research
direction in education: a case of ChatGPT and Midjourney","Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools have become
increasingly accessible and have impacted school education in numerous
ways. However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In
schools, teachers' perspectives are crucial for making sense of
innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to
investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives
of teachers and leaders. It used four domains - learning, teaching,
assessment, and administration - as the initial framework suggested in a
systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants
were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They
completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and
Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis
identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three
suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite
knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for
policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They
also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in
education.","Chiu, Thomas K. F.","artificial intelligence; Generative AI in education; teacher education;

article,Sustainability of translator training in higher education,"The United Nations has set a Sustainable Development Goal in education
to be met hopefully by 2030. One of the target areas is to substantially
increase the number of youth and adults possessing training and
proficiency relevant to the technical and vocational skills needed for
employment, well-paying jobs, and decent entrepreneurships. Enrolled
students need to be equipped with core competencies suitable for the
fields in which they are specializing, including the field of
translation. For student translators, ``transcreation{''} is a core
competency they are expected to acquire and practice. With its
increasing application in all sectors of life, the use of artificial
intelligence or machine translation is on its way to becoming mainstream
in the translation industry, eliminating bread-winning opportunities
from translators, leaving them in the stream of life to sink or swim.
That is why trainers of translators and practitioners alike insist that
it is time to consider transcreation so that student translators can
better embrace future challenges and boost their employability. A
one-shot case study was adopted in this research. After a one-semester
trial of teaching and practicing transcreation, an online questionnaire
survey was administered to gain the overall perceptions of transcreation
from the students. Findings show that the students have raised their
awareness of transcreation as a novel approach to translation and most
of them feel confident about their employability in the translation job
market. Implications for translation syllabus design and translator
training are also illustrated.","Zhu, Minghai",No data,10.1371/journal.pone.0283522,2023,No data

article,"Taylor, the Disability Disclosure Virtual Assistant: A Case Study of
Participatory Research with Disabled Students","Administrative burden in education is a serious issue for disabled
students. Form-filling and bureaucracy are ubiquitous in further and
higher education, particularly for students who need to disclose a
disability and arrange for accommodations and support for an equitable
educational experience. Paradoxically, many of these processes are
inherently inaccessible for disabled students, and yet completing them
can be critical to their success. Artificial Intelligence has potential
to alleviate some of the burden imposed by administration and
bureaucracy; virtual assistants and chatbots can replace forms with
dialogue, without placing additional strain on institutions. However, it
is essential that solutions are designed in partnership with disabled
students to ensure that students' needs are met, their concerns
addressed, and the final solution is equitable for them. This paper
explores a case study of participatory research with disabled students
in a large UK distance learning institution, in which participatory
research identified an issue of administrative burden for disabled
students, and a virtual assistant was designed as a solution using
participatory design. It shares the methodology and design process,
explores findings from different phases of the research, and shares
recurrent themes arising throughout the study. In doing so, it aims to
provide a foundation for future participatory research to reduce
barriers for disabled students.","Lister, Kate and Coughlan, Tim and Kenny, Ian and Tudor, Ruth and

in Intelligent Decision Support Systems","The integration of Artificial Intelligence techniques into Decision
Support Systems yields effective solutions to decision problems,
especially when complex scenarios are at hand. However, the use of
intelligent black-box models can hinder the decision support system's
potential to be fully adopted because opaque processes raise suspicions
and doubts among careful decision makers. Moreover, appropriate and
comprehensible explanations may foster trustworthiness and allow for
reasonable adjustments or even corrections. This work proposed an
approach that incorporates three reasonability aspects into Decision
Systems: feasibility, rationality, and plausibility. Thus, by providing
decision makers with reasonable candidate solutions for a complex
problem, they are expected to perform their tasks more effectively (i.e.
decide with more efficiency as well as efficacy). The new approach is
accompanied by two proofs of concept in the health and public security
areas. Comparative results using random and rational approaches,
including the simulation of distinct user profiles, are presented. The
proposed approach achieved superior metrics with regard to feasibility
and plausibility, suggesting that this proposition can be applied to

result of this, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was born.
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in a wide range of societal
contexts. It has had a significant impact on the realm of education.
Using big data to support multistage views of every subject of opinion
helps to recognize the unique characteristics of each aspect and
improves social network governance's suitability. As public opinion in

article,"An Automated Virtual Reality Training System for Teacher-Student
Interaction: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Shortages in qualified supervision and other resources
prevent education personnel from rehearsing effective practices.
Interactive simulations, although increasingly used in education,
frequently require instructor management. Automated simulations rarely
engage trainees in skills related to practice (eg, speech).
Objective: We evaluated the capability of delivering behavioral skills
training through an automated virtual reality (VR) simulation using
artificial intelligence to improve the implementation of a nondirective
mathematical questioning strategy.
Methods: We recruited and randomly assigned 30 college-aged participants
to equivalent treatment (ie, lecture, modeling, and VR; 15/30, 50\%) and
control groups (ie, lecture and modeling only; 15/30, 50\%). The
participants were blind to treatment conditions. Sessions and
assessments were conducted face to face and involved the use of VR for
assessment regardless of the condition. Lessons concerned the use of a
nondirective mathematical questioning strategy in instances where a
simulated student provided correct or incorrect answers to word
problems. The measures included observed and automated assessments of
participant performance and subjective assessments of participant
confidence. The participants completed the pretest, posttest, and
maintenance probes each week over the course of 3 weeks.
Results: A mixed ANOVA revealed significant main effects of time
(F-2,F-27=124.154; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.816) and treatment
(F-1,F-28=19.281; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.408) as well as an interaction
effect (F-2,F-28=8.429; P<.001; eta(2)(p)=0.231) for the average
percentage of steps in the questioning procedure. Posttest scores for
the intervention group (mean 88\%, SD 22.62\%) exceeded those of the
control group (mean 63.33\%, SD 22.64\%), with t(28)=3.653, P<.001, and
Cohen d=1.334. Maintenance scores indicated a positive effect of the
intervention (mean 83.33\%, SD 24.40\%) relative to the control (mean
54.67\%, SD 15.98\%), t(28)=3.807, P<.001, Cohen d=1.39. A Mann-Whitney
U test indicated that the treatment groups' self-ratings of confidence
(mean 2.41, SD 0.51) were higher than those of the control group (mean
2.04, SD 0.52), U=64, P=.04, r=0.137.

article,"PADAr: physician-oriented artificial intelligence-facilitating diagnosis
aid for retinal diseases","Purpose: Retinopathy screening via digital imaging is promising for
early detection and timely treatment, and tracking retinopathic
abnormality over time can help to reveal the risk of disease
progression. We developed an innovative physician-oriented artificial
intelligence-facilitating diagnosis aid system for retinal diseases for
screening multiple retinopathies and monitoring the regions of potential
abnormality over time.
Approach: Our dataset contains 4908 fundus images from 304 eyes with
image-level annotations, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related
macular degeneration, cellophane maculopathy, pathological myopia, and
healthy control (HC). The screening model utilized a VGG-based feature
extractor and multiple-binary convolutional neural network-based
classifiers. Images in time series were aligned via affine transforms
estimated through speeded-up robust features. Heatmaps of retinopathy
were generated from the feature extractor using gradient-weighted class
activation mapping++, and individual candidate retinopathy sites were
identified from the heatmaps using clustering algorithm. Nested
cross-validation with a train-to-test split of 80\% to 20\% was used to
evaluate the performance of the screening model.
Results: Our screening model achieved 99\% accuracy, 93\% sensitivity,
and 97\% specificity in discriminating between patients with retinopathy
and HCs. For discriminating between types of retinopathy, our model
achieved an averaged performance of 80\% accuracy, 78\% sensitivity,
94\% specificity, 79\% F1-score, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70.
Moreover, visualization results were also shown to provide reasonable
candidate sites of retinopathy.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the capability of the proposed
model for extracting diagnostic information of the abnormality and
lesion locations, which allows clinicians to focus on patient-centered
treatment and untangles the pathological plausibility hidden in deep
learning models. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative

ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING AND LEARNING (2015-2021): WHAT ARE THE CURRENT
EFFECTS?","Aim/Purpose This study carried out a systematic review of the literature
on artificial intelli-gence (AI) in English language teaching (ELT). The
objective was to delineate the current research progress in the field
and to further understand the chal-lenges.
Background The study analyzed articles published between 2015 and 2021.
Methodology The qualitative research method was employed. Five steps
were taken to steer the review. 200 articles were scrutinized; 64 were
retained.
Contribution Prior research on AI in ELT has not investigated how the
literature is progress-ing or what areas of AI are being covered.
Without a holistic picture, some im-portant research findings could be
missed. Understanding how studies on AI in ELT are designed and
implemented will contribute to a greater understanding of the existing
state of research.
Findings Findings show that there is a promising future for AI in ELT.
AI in ELT yielded positive results in terms of optimizing the English
language skills, translation, assessment, recognition, attitude,
satisfaction, etc. It was also found out that more and more articles on
the topic are being published; the mixed research method is the most
commonly used, higher education level is the most sampled, students as
participants are the most sampled, and most studies developed novel
AI-based systems. Various AI approaches have been identified in the
re-viewed studies, including machine learning, neural network, support
vector ma-chine, genetic algorithms, deep learning, decision tree,
expert system, natural language processing, data mining, cloud
computing, and edge computing. How-ever, AI in ELT is still in its
infancy, where little research has been conducted and gaps in the
literature are still present, especially in terms of inherent issues
related to body language, gestures, expressions, emotions, translation,
lack of elaborate description of teaching material used for learning
driven by AI, uncer-tainties and vagueness with regards to what can be
considered under the realm of AI, and most authors being outside of the
ELT discipline.
Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers This
literature review is likely to provide practitioners with an overview of
the current adopted technology, research method, instruments and/or
tools, educa-tional level, language skill, and the effects reported by
the AI-based studies for designing effective systems for the use of AI
in their ELT classrooms. Researchers need to conduct research on AI in
ELT along with a detailed in-depth description of the methodology,
research design, and the proposed sys-tems used to achieve AI in ELT.
Furthermore, it is recommended that research-ers explore the efficiency
of AI-based systems used in previous research and ensure their relevance
and functionality. They are also required to provide in-depth analysis
of the challenges inherent to systems that have been highlighted in the
literature, which will maximize the potentials of these AI-based
technolo-gies.
Impact on Society The findings of this paper can provide visualization
of research findings that could particularly benefit researchers,
educators, and AI specialists who are in-volved in the study of the
applications of AI in ELT.

intelligence and which makes predictions with mathematical and
statistical operations, is used frequently in education as in every
field of life. Nowadays, it is seen that millions of data are recorded
continuously, and a large amount of data accumulation has occurred.
Although data accumulation increases exponentially, the number of
analysts and their capabilities to process these data are insufficient.
Although we live in the information age, it is more accurate to say that
we live in the data age. By using stored and accumulated data, it is
becoming increasingly essential to reveal meaningful relationships and
trends and to make predictions for the future. It is important to
analyze the data obtained from the education process and to evaluate the
success of the students and the factors affecting success. These
analyses may also contribute to future training activities. In this
study, a data set, including socio-demographic variables of students
enrolled in distance education at Hitit University, was used. The
authors estimated the success of the students with demographic and
social variables such as age, gender, city, family income, family
education level. The primary purpose is to provide students with
information about their estimated academic achievement at the beginning
of the process. Thus, at the beginning of the education process,
students' success can be increased by informing the students who are
predicted to be unsuccessful. Diversification and enhancement of this
data may also support other decision-making mechanisms in the training
process. Additionally, the factors affecting students' academic success
were researched, and the students' educational outcomes were evaluated.
Prediction success was compared using various machine learning
algorithms. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the
Random Forest algorithm was more predictive of student achievement than
others.","Akmese, Omer Faruk and Kor, Hakan and Erbay, Hasan",machine learning in education; adult education; educational data mining,10.33407/itlt.v82i2.4178,2021,15

article,"An Artificial Intelligence System for the Detection of Bladder Cancer
via Cystoscopy: A Multicenter Diagnostic Study","Background Cystoscopy plays an important role in bladder cancer (BCa)
diagnosis and treatment, but its sensitivity needs improvement.
Artificial intelligence has shown promise in endoscopy, but few
cystoscopic applications have been reported. We report a Cystoscopy
Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (CAIDS) for BCa diagnosis.
Methods In total, 69 204 images from 10 729 consecutive patients from 6
hospitals were collected and divided into training, internal validation,
and external validation sets. The CAIDS was built using a pyramid scene
parsing network and transfer learning. A subset (n = 260) of the
validation sets was used for a performance comparison between the CAIDS
and urologists for complex lesion detection. The diagnostic accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the
Clopper-Pearson method. Results The diagnostic accuracies of the CAIDS
were 0.977 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.979) in the internal validation set and
0.990 (95\% CI = 0.979 to 0.996), 0.982 (95\% CI = 0.974 to 0.988),
0.978 (95\% CI = 0.959 to 0.989), and 0.991 (95\% CI = 0.987 to 0.994)
in different external validation sets. In the CAIDS vs urologists'
comparisons, the CAIDS showed high accuracy and sensitivity (accuracy =
0.939, 95\% CI = 0.902 to 0.964; sensitivity = 0.954, 95\% CI = 0.902 to
0.983) with a short latency of 12 seconds, much more accurate and
quicker than the expert urologists. Conclusions The CAIDS achieved
accurate BCa detection with a short latency. The CAIDS may provide many
clinical benefits, from increasing the diagnostic accuracy for BCa, even
for commonly misdiagnosed cases such as flat cancerous tissue (carcinoma
in situ), to reducing the operation time for cystoscopy.","Wu, Shaoxu and Chen, Xiong and Pan, Jiexin and Dong, Wen and Diao,

artificial intelligence-assisted disaster damage assessment","Accurate damage assessment is a critical step in post-disaster risk
assessment, mitigation, and recovery. Current practices performed by
experts and reconnaissance teams in the form of field evaluation require
considerable time and resources. Recent advances in remote sensing
imagery, artificial intelligence (AI), and computer vision have enhanced
automated and rapid disaster damage assessment. Recent literature has
shown promising progress in AI-assisted aerial damage assessment.
However, accounting for the uncertainty in the outcome for improved
quantification of confidence and enhanced model explainability for human
decision-makers remains one of the key challenges. Overlooking
uncertainty can lead to erroneous decisions, especially in
highly-consequential tasks such as damage assessment. The aim of this
study is to develop uncertainty-aware deep learning models for the
assessment of post-disaster damage using aerial imaging. Within the
framework of variational Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo dropout
sampling technique is used to propagate epistemic uncertainty in model
predictions. With this stochastic setting, the model produces damage
prediction labels with softmax as random variables, which helps quantify
confidence in the model outcome using appropriate measures of
uncertainty. Two networks are implemented and trained separately on two
different disaster damage datasets consisting of unmanned aerial vehicle
building footage as well as satellite-captured post-disaster imagery.
The first network attains 59.4\% accuracy in building classification,
and the second network gives an accuracy of 55.1\%. Results from
uncertainty analysis, model confidence quantification, and analyzing

On-Device Artificial Intelligence","In response to the aging trend in society and to Human Augmentation
beings for home-based activities, this paper proposes an Abnormal
Movement Detection system, using the common athome movements of standing
up and hand tremors while picking up items for abnormal movement
verification. This can be easily applied in ordinary homes or long-term
care institutions; for those living alone with limited resources, there
is no longer any need to purchase expensive monitoring equipment to
achieve improved quality of life. Therefore, this research collected and
built the own dataset as the first important step of the study. The
proposed Abnormal Movement Detection system is implemented by designing
a deep learning network. Several issues, including the network
architecture, the novel method of data augmentation and the scoring
method of expanding the intervals between abnormality levels, are
studied. For achieving the home-based real-time detection, there are
four main contributions of this paper. The first is that a training
dataset was collected and established: From this, the pathognomonic
movement categories are easy to observe in home activities and geometric
data augmentation can be used to improve the related home activity video
collection. The second is the abnormal behavior detection architecture:
This architecture has several important function blocks including
detecting object, detecting action, inspecting abnormal movement and
reminding event, using Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN + LSTM) as the core network for abnormal motion
detection. With movement abnormality evaluation based on different
levels, it can judge abnormal behaviors and conduct model training,
performance evaluation and architecture optimization with both public
domain datasets and the movement dataset collected in this research
project. The third is the proliferation of new attributes in the videos:
New attributes are added to the original videos through a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), producing new training videos; the
effectiveness of two different generation methods is evaluated. Finally,
the algorithms developed in this paper are deployed on
resource-constrained On-device Artificial Intelligence (AI). Activity
videos from a total of 20 people were collected; in all, 53 videos of
StandUp and 60 videos of PickUpItems were obtained to establish the
training dataset. When CNN and LSTM network were added to Batch
Normalization (BN), and Global Average Pooling (GAP) replaced Fully

data augmentation, geometric transformations and GAN were used to
estimate the performance. The experimental results showed that the
geometric transformation using brightness adjustment had the highest

contribution/objective of this research is to address the gaps in

desiccant-enhanced cooling system is adapted to generate a set of
input-output data sets. The set of data includes ambient temperature,
ambient humidity, regeneration temperature, supply airflow rate, and
return airflow rate yielding the cooling capacity and total water
footprints of the system. The results of deep learning algorithm using
an artificial neural network have suggested that the architectures

the cooling capacity and total water footprints with a coefficient of
determination of 0.98856 and 0.99246, respectively. Secondly, the

in the prediction of shock, transfusion, and definitive surgical therapy
in patients with truncal gunshot wounds","BACKGROUND In-field triage tools for trauma patients are limited by
availability of information, linear risk classification, and a lack of
confidence reporting. We therefore set out to develop and test a machine
learning algorithm that can overcome these limitations by accurately and
confidently making predictions to support in-field triage in the first
hours after traumatic injury. METHODS Using an American College of
Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program-derived database of truncal
and junctional gunshot wound (GSW) patients (aged 16-60 years), we
trained an information-aware Dirichlet deep neural network (field
artificial intelligence triage). Using supervised training, field
artificial intelligence triage was trained to predict shock and the need
for major hemorrhage control procedures or early massive transfusion
(MT) using GSW anatomical locations, vital signs, and patient
information available in the field. In parallel, a confidence model was
developed to predict the true-class probability (scale of 0-1),
indicating the likelihood that the prediction made was correct, based on
the values and interconnectivity of input variables. RESULTS A total of
29,816 patients met all the inclusion criteria. Shock, major surgery,
and early MT were identified in 13.0\%, 22.4\%, and 6.3\% of the
included patients, respectively. Field artificial intelligence triage
achieved mean areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
0.89, 0.86, and 0.82 for prediction of shock, early MT, and major
surgery, respectively, for 80/20 train-test splits over 1,000 epochs.
Mean predicted true-class probability for errors/correct predictions was
0.25/0.87 for shock, 0.30/0.81 for MT, and 0.24/0.69 for major surgery.
CONCLUSION Field artificial intelligence triage accurately identifies
potential shock in truncal GSW patients and predicts their need for MT
and major surgery, with a high degree of certainty. The presented model
is an important proof of concept. Future iterations will use an
expansion of databases to refine and validate the model, further adding
to its potential to improve triage in the field, both in civilian and

article,Towards cross-lingual voice cloning in higher education,"The rapid progress of modern AI tools for automatic speech recognition
and machine translation is leading to a progressive cost reduction to
produce publishable subtitles for educational videos in multiple
languages. Similarly, text-to-speech technology is experiencing large
improvements in terms of quality, flexibility and capabilities. In
particular, state-of-the-art systems are now capable of seamlessly
dealing with multiple languages and speakers in an integrated manner,
thus enabling lecturer's voice cloning in languages she/he might not
even speak. This work is to report the experience gained on using such
systems at the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (UPV), mainly as a
guidance for other educational organizations willing to conduct similar
studies. It builds on previous work on the UPV's main repository of
educational videos, MediaUPV, to produce multilingual subtitles at scale
and low cost. Here, a detailed account is given on how this work has
been extended to also allow for massive machine dubbing of MediaUPV.
This includes collecting 59 h of clean speech data from UPV's academic
staff, and extending our production pipeline of subtitles with a
state-of-the-art multilingual and multi-speaker text-to-speech system
trained from the collected data. Our main result comes from an
extensive, subjective evaluation of this system by lecturers
contributing to data collection. In brief, it is shown that

to MediaUPV, but also needed as soon as possible by students to improve
its accessibility and bridge language barriers.","Perez, Alejandro and Diaz-Munio, Goncal Garces and Gimenez, Adria and

article,"Automated Detection of Acute Myocardial Infarction Using Asynchronous
Electrocardiogram Signals-Preview of Implementing Artificial
Intelligence With Multichannel Electrocardiographs Obtained From
Smartwatches: Retrospective Study","Background: When using a smartwatch to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG)
signals from multiple leads, the device has to be placed on different
parts of the body sequentially. The ECG signals measured from different
leads are asynchronous. Artificial intelligence (AI) models for
asynchronous ECG signals have barely been explored.
Objective: We aimed to develop an AI model for detecting acute
myocardial infarction using asynchronous ECGs and compare its
performance with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a
commercial ECG analysis software. We sought to evaluate the feasibility
of implementing multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on
smartwatches. Moreover, we aimed to determine the optimal number of
leads for sufficient diagnostic power.
Methods: We extracted ECGs recorded within 24 hours from each visit to
the emergency room of Ajou University Medical Center between June 1994
and January 2018 from patients aged 20 years or older. The ECGs were
labeled on the basis of whether a diagnostic code corresponding to acute
myocardial infarction was entered. We derived asynchronous ECG lead sets
from standard 12-lead ECG reports and simulated a situation similar to
the sequential recording of ECG leads via smartwatches. We constructed
an AI model based on residual networks and self-attention mechanisms by
randomly masking each lead channel during the training phase and then
testing the model using various targeting lead sets with the remaining
lead channels masked.
Results: The performance of lead sets with 3 or more leads compared
favorably with that of the automatic ECG interpretations provided by a
commercial ECG analysis software, with 8.1\%-13.9\% gain in sensitivity
when the specificity was matched. Our results indicate that multiple
lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms can be implemented on smartwatches.
Model performance generally increased as the number of leads increased
(12-lead sets: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
{[}AUROC] 0.880; 4-lead sets: AUROC 0.858, SD 0.008; 3-lead sets: AUROC
0.845, SD 0.011; 2-lead sets: AUROC 0.813, SD 0.018; single-lead sets:
AUROC 0.768, SD 0.001). Considering the short amount of time needed to
measure additional leads, measuring at least 3 leads-ideally more than 4
leads-is necessary for minimizing the risk of failing to detect acute
myocardial infarction occurring in a certain spatial location or
direction.
Conclusions: By developing an AI model for detecting acute myocardial
infarction with asynchronous ECG lead sets, we demonstrated the
feasibility of multiple lead-based AI-enabled ECG algorithms on
smartwatches for automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. We also
demonstrated the necessity of measuring at least 3 leads for accurate
detection. Our results can be used as reference for the development of
other AI models using sequentially measured asynchronous ECG leads via
smartwatches for detecting various cardiac disorders.","Han, Changho and Song, Youngjae and Lim, Hong-Seok and Tae, Yunwon and

this system for the detection of alveolar bone loss in periapical
radiographs in the anterior region of the dental arches. We also aimed
to evaluate the usefulness of the system in categorizing the severity of
bone loss due to periodontal disease. Method A data set of 1724
intraoral periapical images of upper and lower anterior teeth in 1610
adult patients were retrieved from the ROMEXIS software management
system at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Using
a combination of pre-trained deep CNN architecture and a self-trained
network, the radiographic images were used to determine the optimal CNN
algorithm. The diagnostic and predictive accuracy, precision, confusion
matrix, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen
Kappa, were calculated using the deep CNN algorithm in Python. Results
The periapical radiograph dataset was divided randomly into 70\%
training, 20\% validation, and 10\% testing datasets. With the deep
learning algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy for classifying normal
versus disease was 73.0\%, and 59\% for the classification of the levels
of severity of the bone loss. The Model showed a significant difference
in the confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, MCC and
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen Kappa, and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC), between both the binary and
multi-classification models. Conclusion This study revealed that the
deep CNN algorithm (VGG-16) was useful to detect alveolar bone loss in
periapical radiographs, and has a satisfactory ability to detect the
severity of bone loss in teeth. The results suggest that machines can
perform better based on the level classification and the captured
characteristics of the image diagnosis. With additional optimization of
the periodontal dataset, it is expected that a computer-aided detection
system can become an effective and efficient procedure for aiding in the
detection and staging of periodontal disease.","Alotaibi, Ghala and Awawdeh, Mohammed and Farook, Fathima Fazrina and

According to our survey on Mandarin online course training in Northwest
China (N=343), we found that 81.6\% of samples are satisfied with the
Mandarin online training courses; 21.6\% think that they have learned
new teaching methods/teaching concepts from the teacher through the
Mandarin training; 36.2\% think that they have learned the theoretical
knowledge of Mandarin through the Mandarin training. Gender, age,

different ages, learning foundations, and cultural backgrounds by
designing different online course patterns, so as to enhance the
high-quality promotion of Mandarin.","Su, Yawen and Chen, Guofu and Li, Moyan and Shi, Tengfei and Fang,

the computing speed and performance of information terminals to increase
exponentially. Artificial intelligence technology emerged in this
context. As an efficient work system, artificial intelligence has been
introduced into many areas of social life. Especially in the field of
education, it has made outstanding contributions. At this stage, the
conflict between Eastern and Western civilizations is intensifying. As
the most active ideological group, college students have not yet formed
a scientific understanding of the pros and cons of Eastern and Western
civilizations, and it is easy for them to fall into confusion in this
kind of ideological turmoil. This requires that the ideological and
political education in our country's colleges and universities
effectively play a role, strengthen ideological guidance, and create a
new system of practical teaching of college ideological and political
theory courses under the background of wireless communication.
Ideological and political education, as one of the courses with
outstanding characteristics in our country's university education
courses, has a guiding role that cannot be ignored for university
students. This paper uses a questionnaire survey method to conduct an
online survey of 500 college students from 6 universities in Shanghai to
obtain first-hand information on the current ideological and political
practice courses of Chinese universities and then sort out the emergence
of artificial intelligence-based decision support systems in China. The
practical class encountered difficulties and explored strategies to
alleviate this dilemma, hoping to provide a useful reference for the
development of ideological and political teaching in China in the

article,"Artificial Intelligence Evaluation for Mathematics Teaching in Colleges
under the Guidance of Wireless Network","Comprehensively improving the quality of teaching is the highlight of
current higher education. Also, it meets the basic needs of China's
current transformation into a country for strong education. Mathematics
is one of the most important subjects in education these days, which is
widely applied in research, social life, and understanding various
science theories and laws. Hence, improving the quality of teaching
mathematics in colleges becomes an important task in modern college
teaching. In particular, the wireless integration of information has
enriched and diversified the teaching methods of higher education.
Vigorously promoting the application of wireless network technology in
mathematics teaching is not only an effective way to solve the
insufficient supply of educational resources but also a bold attempt to
innovate the mathematics teaching mode in colleges and universities.
Firstly, this work proposes an IACO-BP (improved ant colony
optimization-based backpropagation) network to evaluate teaching quality
for higher level mathematics in a wireless network environment. It
improves the traditional ant colony optimization algorithm from three
aspects, namely ant colony pheromone adaptive volatility coefficient,
pheromone iterative elite selection strategy, and population iteration,
adding a variation factor to construct IACO. Then, we use IACO to
optimize initial weight and threshold to solve the issue of BP network's
falling into local optimum and improve network performance. Secondly,
this work puts forward a series of countermeasures for the construction
of mathematics teaching system in colleges. The correctness and
superiority of the proposed strategy are verified by comparing the
mathematics teaching quality in colleges before and after using the
proposed strategies. Various aspects of mathematics teaching, such as
teaching objectives, teaching content, and teaching process, are
evaluated before and after using these strategies. These features are
improved by a significant margin, up to 2.6\%, after applying the
proposed strategies.","Chen, Zhiqin",No data,10.1155/2022/3201004,2022,No data

Artificial Intelligence: Incorporating Local Post Hoc Explanations for a
Glass-box Model","Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to cognitive dysfunction
among older people worldwide, making it nearly impossible for them to
carry out their daily lives. Due to the inherent characteristics of
Alzheimer's disease and its impact on the brain, timely intervention is
crucial to delay its onset and mitigate its progression. Currently, the
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease often occurs at a stage where it is too
late for effective prevention measures, allowing the disease to cause
significant damage to the brain. The use of machine learning and deep
learning models is critical for the classification of demented and
non-demented cases, but most highly accurate models are non-linear and
less transparent, not revealing the logic behind the predictions.
Therefore, incorporating interpretability components into the models
will make them more transparent and trustworthy. This study is aimed to
develop appropriate diagnostic methods capable of assessing Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the early stage of Alzheimer's disease that
occurs before the irreversible loss of neurons. Methods: Explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) refers to AI systems that can provide
explanations for their decisions or predictions. In the context of AD
classification, explainable AI systems aim to provide insights into the
features or characteristics of the model used to make a prediction. This
XAI provides a mechanism to understand and interpret the basis of a
model's predictions which is more important for improving the trust in
the system and its results. As such, a non-linear neural network is
employed in this work to distinguish between demented and non-demented
cases while local post hoc explanations are incorporated to make it a
glass-box model using the XAI techniques such as SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations
(LIME). Results: The application of LIME provided valuable insights into
the impact of various factors on predictions. Notably, factors such as
CDR, Age, and ASF aligned with clinical knowledge and proved
instrumental in predicting dementia cases. Conversely, features like
nWBV, MMSE, and eTIV adversely affected the predictions, highlighting
their significance in identifying non-demented cases. Similarly,
exploring SHAP values yielded a comprehensive understanding of the
decision-making process employed by the model in detecting Alzheimer's
disease. Conclusion: Through the utilization of explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, this study endeavors to develop a dependable
and transparent technique for early detection, monitoring, and
personalized interventions in the realm of Alzheimer's disease.","Varghese, Abraham and George, Ben and Sherimon, Vinu and Al Shuaily,

task of attracting new students who can effectively meet their diverse
academic demands. With these demands come the need for those
institutions to develop strategies that can enhance students' learning
experiences at various educational levels. Predicting the academic
success at an early stage would allow academic institutions to develop
specific enrolment guidelines while avoiding poor performance. The main
purpose of this study was to predict the academic performance of
students, their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in particular, at
postgraduate levels (e.g., master's degree), using and comparing
different machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work uses a real
dataset of 635 master's students collected from the college of graduate
studies of a reputable private university in Malaysia. The predictive
model's goodness-of-fitness is determined using the coefficient of
determination R-2, which indicates the percentage of the variance in the
dependent variables. The mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error
(MAE) are used to evaluate the model's performance, by identifying
discrepancies between the predicted CGPA and the actual CGPA. Of the six
different ML models applied, our results showed that the artificial
neural network (ANN) model has the best performance, achieving 89\% of
the variation in the CGPA of the students, with a training error of only
0.06 CGPA points and a prediction error of 0.08 CGPA points. The
Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with squared exponential kernel
algorithm achieved 71\% of the CGPA variation. The model achieved 0.095
CGPA points for both training and evaluation errors. Exploring other
variables such as research activities, marital status, and living
conditions would have improved the overall accuracy of the proposed ML
models. Therefore, future investigations should focus on predicting the
academic performance of larger numbers of postgraduates (i.e., PhD and
Masters) using different predictive variables and AI models. (C) 2022

Although they grew up with technology, there are many studies which
underline that students' digital skills are not what they might seem.
Thus, even if they are more familiar than professors or parents with
functions and options available on the most used social networks and
applications like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube etc., they
still need ``support with some areas of digital practice, particularly
in an academic context{''} (JISC, 2015).
But are these perceptions / expectations of students' digital skills
based on reality? Moreover, what should we do as their professors?
Firstly, we should not forget that not all students have equal access to
digital resources. Some of them need to be trained more
concretely/effectively and most of them need to refine and update their
digital skills and competencies in order to become more employable,
ready to cope with the digital jobs of the future.
Secondly, they need to benefit from staff well equipped with digital
skills, who can design and deliver courses with technology integrated,
able to pass on the relevant digital skills to their students and
colleagues.
Thirdly, they need a proper and adequate digital environment.
Given this approach, we formulated our research questions as follows:
What are the challenges in creating the right environments for digital
learning?
What are institutions doing in order to equip professors with digital
skills?
The aim of the present paper is to review existing evidence on what a
digital university means. What is it? What actions should we take
towards becoming a digital university? Thus, we conducted a small-scale

the aforesaid research questions and to emphasize what concrete steps,

taurine, threonic acid, pseudouridine, xylitol and lyxitol, successfully
distinguish meloxicam-treated and saline-treated cats with up to
75-100\% sensitivity and specificity. This panel of urinary metabolites
may prove a useful and non-invasive diagnostic tool for monitoring

article,"Analysis of portable solar concrete ponds by using coal cinder to trap
thermal energy of sustainable building using artificial intelligence","Cinder is a waste product made from the coal residue left over from
power plant blast furnaces. Solar energy is a promising renewable energy
source, but because of its erratic availability, energy storage
technologies must be used. Our research suggests employing coal cinder
(CC) to boost the thermal energy stored in transportable solar concrete
ponds, combining rock mechanics with renewable energy. The concepts of
renewable energy and rock mechanics are combined in this invention.
Additionally, because it doesn't release any pollutants into the sky, it
is great for low heat applications like building cooling and heating.
However, due to its sporadic nature, solar energy requires effective
energy storage to be used at night and in cloudy weather. By adding coal
cinders to the bottom layer of a solar concrete pond in order to
increase its heat energy, this work integrates rock mechanics with
sustainable energy. A variety of small-scale research use the standard
micro solar concrete ponds. Also offered is a numerical calculation for
predicting energy development over a sizable area of a solar pond with a
salt gradient. The coal cinders may significantly raise the temperature
at the pond's bottom. With a constant temperature differential of 30
degrees C and 20 degrees C throughout the gradient layer for two
different pond sizes with depths of 1.5 m and 1.0 m, this study provides
thermal analysis of a salt gradient solar pond using machine learning as
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and extracting heat from the Lower
Convective Zone (LCZ). Going through the regression indices (RMSE, R2,
r), the energy efficiency (heat) of the first 1.5-meter-deep concrete
pond varies between 22.1 and 11.3\% throughout the winter. The energy
performance of a solar pond decreases dramatically when the
non-convective zone thickness and its size are decreased. For the two
concrete ponds with depths of 1.5 m and 1.0 m, respectively, the annual
average efficiencies are 23\% and 16\%. Hence, the solar pond
demonstrates that it is an effective method for utilizing solar energy
and may be a useful option for low-temperature energy needs, such as
room heating.","Yan, Gongxing and Teng, Bin and Elkamchouchi, Dalia H. and Alkhalifah,

article,"Influencing factors, prediction and prevention of depression in college
students: A literature review","The high prevalence of depression among college students has a strong
negative impact on individual physical and mental health, academic
development, and interpersonal communication. This paper reviewed the
extant literature by identifying nonpathological factors related to
college students' depression, investigating the methods of predicting
depression, and exploring nonpharmaceutical interventions for college
students' depression. The influencing factors of college students'
depression mainly fell into four categories: biological factors,
personality and psychological state, college experience, and lifestyle.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has exacerbated the severity of
depression among college students worldwide and poses grave challenges
to the prevention and treatment of depression, given that the
coronavirus has spread quickly with high infection rates, and the
pandemic has changed the daily routines of college life. To predict and
measure mental health, more advanced methods, such as machine algorithms
and artificial intelligence, have emerged in recent years apart from the
traditional commonly used psychological scales. Regarding
nonpharmaceutical prevention measures, both general measures and
professional measures for the prevention and treatment of college
students' depression were examined in this study. Students who
experience depressive disorders need family support and personalized
interventions at college, which should also be supplemented by
professional interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and
online therapy. Through this literature review, we insist that the
technology of identification, prediction, and prevention of depression
among college students based on big data platforms will be extensively
used in the future. Higher education institutions should understand the
potential risk factors related to college students' depression and make
more accurate screening and prevention available with the help of
advanced technologies.","Liu, Xin-Qiao and Guo, Yu-Xin and Zhang, Wen-Jie and Gao, Wen-Juan","Depression; Prediction; Prevention; Artificial intelligence; Big data;

article,"Use of Artificial Intelligence Methods for Predicting the Strength of
Recycled Aggregate Concrete and the Influence of Raw Ingredients","Cracking is one of the main problems in concrete structures and is
affected by various parameters. The step-by-step laboratory method,
which includes casting specimens, curing for a certain period, and
testing, remains a source of worry in terms of cost and time. Novel
machine learning methods for anticipating the behavior of raw materials
on the ultimate output of concrete are being introduced to address the
difficulties outlined above such as the excessive consumption of time
and money. This work estimates the splitting-tensile strength of
concrete containing recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) using artificial
intelligence methods considering nine input parameters and 154 mixes.
One individual machine learning algorithm (support vector machine) and
three ensembled machine learning algorithms (AdaBoost, Bagging, and
random forest) are considered. Additionally, a post hoc model-agnostic
method named SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was performed to study
the influence of raw ingredients on the splitting-tensile strength. The
model's performance was assessed using the coefficient of determination
(R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
Then, the model's performance was validated using k-fold
cross-validation. The random forest model, with an R-2 of 0.96,
outperformed the AdaBoost models. The random forest models with greater
R-2 and lower error (RMSE = 0.49) had superior performance. It was
revealed from the SHAP analysis that the cement content had the highest
positive influence on the splitting-tensile strength of the recycled
aggregate concrete and the primary contact of cement is with water. The
feature interaction plot shows that high water content has a negative
impact on the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) splitting-tensile
strength, but the increased cement content had a beneficial effect.","Pan, Xinchen and Xiao, Yixuan and Suhail, Salman Ali and Ahmad, Waqas

teaching resources has gradually attracted people's attention. How to
optimize and reorganize the numerous teaching resources so as to
maximize the teaching efficiency and achieve the best teaching effect is
a question that the majority of college management workers must think

networks and wireless networks have made considerable progress. This
article optimizes the resources of colleges and universities from these
two aspects. First, this work proposes an improved artificial neural

adaptive genetic algorithm itself has problems such as slow evolution
speed and poor individual diversity of the population. After that an
improved adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize BP network
training process. By introducing individual evolutionary trend
adjustment parameters, a new calculation formula for crossover
probability as well as mutation probability is constructed. Improved BP
algorithm can effectively avoid the shortcomings of local minima.
Second, additional momentum and adaptive learning rate strategies are
used to optimize BP network to promote the efficiency for network
training. Third, the artificial intelligence network is deployed in the
wireless network, and the wireless network will complete the work of

Temperatures Using Finite Element and Hybrid Artificial Intelligence
Techniques","It is very important to keep structures and constructional elements in
service during and after exposure to elevated temperatures.
Investigation of the structural behaviour of different components and
structures at elevated temperatures is an approach to manipulate the
serviceability of the structures during heat exposure. Channel
connectors are widely used shear connectors not only for their appealing
mechanical properties but also for their workability and cost-effective
nature. In this study, a finite element (FE) evaluation was performed on
an authentic composite model, and the behaviour of the channel shear
connector at elevated temperature was examined. Furthermore, a novel
hybrid intelligence algorithm based on a feature-selection trait with
the incorporation of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) algorithms has been developed to predict the slip
response of the channel. The hybrid intelligence algorithm that uses
artificial neural networks is performed on derived data from the FE
study. Finally, the obtained numerical results are compared with extreme
learning machine (ELM) and radial basis function (RBF) results. The
MLP-PSO represented dramatically accurate results for slip value
prediction at elevated temperatures. The results proved the active
presence of the channels, especially to improve the stiffness and
loading capacity of the composite beam. Although the height enhances the
ductility, stiffness is significantly reduced at elevated temperatures.
According to the results, temperature, failure load, the height of
connector and concrete block strength are the key governing parameters
for composite floor design against high temperatures.","Ding, Wangfei and Alharbi, Abdullah and Almadhor, Ahmad and

article,"Seven principles to ensure future-ready accounting graduates - a model
for future research and practice","Purpose
The business environment is changing and education at university
business schools does not appear to keep pace. This paper aims to
identify principles to guide educators in preparing accounting students
for automation and artificial intelligence and sets an agenda for future
research.
Design/methodology/approach
The seven principles are derived from an extensive literature review and
the analysis of qualitative data from focus groups, thought leader
discussions, interviews and workshops.
Findings
The derived seven Cs model includes: critical, conceptual thinking and
the spirit of enquiry; complicate, grapple and fail; create, innovate
and experience; concise communication; collaboration; consciousness,
respectfulness and ethical fibre; and curiosity, lifelong learning and
specialized generalists. An inclusive list of future research topics
related to the seven Cs model is provided to aid researchers' agendas.
Research limitations/implications
Although every attempt was made to base this study purely on expert
opinions, as reflected in journal articles, conference papers,
interviews and focus groups, it is impossible to prevent author biases
from slipping into the interpretation and reflection involved in
creating the model. Readers will also find some overlap in terms of the
accounting business competencies development model's seven Cs, due to
the inter-related nature of the concepts and because the various
definitions of concepts have some habits of the mind and social
competencies in common.
Practical implications
The seven principles will help business schools and higher education
policymakers guide future education developments with a focus on new
competencies and reframed skills, as opposed to new knowledge. The model
ensures that scholars and graduates have insight into the essential
knowledge, attributes and skills that apply to the diverse nature of
accounting vocations and can adapt to unanticipated changes.
Social implications
This new model can be used by business schools to ensure that graduates
can fully contribute to a society impacted by automation and artificial
intelligence by entering the workplace with the requisite skills. It
also responds to critics' fears about the role of business schools in
preparing graduates for the future of work.
Originality/value
The paper contributes in two ways. First, rather than focussing on
particular issues or the shortcomings of current education, it
identifies broad-based principles from a literature review, interviews,
focus groups and workshops. Second, it sets an agenda for future
research.","De Villiers, Rouxelle","Accounting; Communication; Collaboration; Competencies; Students;

Education into the Teaching of University Civics Courses in the Context
of Artificial Intelligence","In higher education teaching work, college students not only need to
master the professional knowledge and professional skills they learn
during their school study but also need to improve their self-education
and self-cultivation and constantly improve their comprehensive ability
of learning. At present, there are differences and relationships between
the education of college students in civic and mental normal education,
and how to play the role of the integration of the two educations has
become a problem that needs to be considered in the current work of
college students' training. The integration between civic education and
mental normal education can make up for the shortcomings of monolithic
civic education and mental normal education work and also optimize the
teaching methods between them from a certain perspective to achieve the
development goals of complementing each other and not being independent
of each other, so that students can understand more learning methods and
contents that promote the normal development of their own minds and
minds. In response to the problem that mind-normal education cannot be
automatically integrated into the teaching of university thought and
political science courses, in the context of artificial intelligence,
this paper proposes a multi-channel-based mind-normal and ideological
and political information fusion model. The model has two channels,
BERT+CNN and BERT and BiLSTM-Attention; firstly, the pretraining model
BERT is used to obtain the word vector representation of the fused text
context; then, the CNN network of channel one is used to enhance the
ability of local feature extraction of the text, and the
BiLSTM-Attention model of channel two enhances the ability of long
sequence text processing and is key. Finally, the fused features of
channel 1 and channel 2 are classified using a softmax excitation
function. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments
are conducted on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.","Wu, JingJing",No data,10.1155/2022/5378694,2022,No data

from January 1, 1997, to January 30, 2020. Studies evaluating an AI
model for the diagnosis of tumor metastasis from medical images were
included. We excluded studies that used histopathology images or medical

Studies providing enough information to construct contingency tables
were included in a meta-analysis.
Findings: We identified 2620 studies, of which 69 were included. Among
them, 34 studies were included in a meta-analysis with a pooled
sensitivity of 82\% (95\% CI 79-84\%), specificity of 84\% (82-87\%) and
AUC of 0.90 (0.87-0.92). Analysis for different AI algorithms showed a
pooled sensitivity of 87\% (83-90\%) for machine learning and 86\%
(82-89\%) for deep learning, and a pooled specificity of 89\% (82-93\%)
for machine learning, and 87\% (82-91\%) for deep learning.
Interpretation: AI algorithms may be used for the diagnosis of tumor
metastasis using medical radiology imaging with equivalent or even
better performance to health-care professionals, in terms of sensitivity
and specificity. At the same time, rigorous reporting standards with
external validation and comparison to health-care professionals are
urgently needed for AI application in the medical field. (c) 2020

surface-enhanced Raman scattering and artificial intelligence-assisted
spectrum interpretation","Electronic cigarettes have rapidly gained acceptance recently.
Nicotine-containing electronic cigarette liquids (eliquids) are
prohibited in some countries, but are permitted and simply available
online in others. A rapid detection method is therefore required for
on-site inspection or screening of a large amount of samples. Our
previous study demonstrated a surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS)-based approach to identify nicotinecontaining e-liquids; without
any pre-treatment, e-liquid can be directly tested on our solid-phase
SERS substrates, made of silver nanoparticle arrays embedded in anodic
aluminium oxide nanochannels (Ag/AAO). However, this approach required
manual determination of spectral signatures and negative samples should
be validated in the second round detection. Here, after examining 406
commercial e-liquids, we refined this approach by developing artificial
intelligence (AI)-assisted spectrum interpretations. We also found that
nicotine and benzoic acid can be simultaneously detected in our
platform. This increased test sensitivity because benzoic acid is
usually used in nicotine salts. Around 64\% of nicotine-positive samples
in this study showed both signatures. Using either cutoffs of nicotine
and benzoic acid peak intensities or a machine learning model based on
the CatBoost algorithm, over 90\% of tested samples can be correctly
discriminated with only one round of SERS measurement. False negative
and false positive rates were 2.5-4.4\% and 4.4-8.9\%, respectively,
depending on the interpretation method and thresholds applied. The new
approach takes only 1 microliter of sample and can be performed in 1-2
min, suitable for on-site inspection with portable Raman detectors. It
could also be a complementary platform to reduce samples that need to be

mindfulness and EI training.
Objective: The main objective of this research study was to determine
the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness
techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve
symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic.
Methods: A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited
from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants
completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of
the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49\%) were

members (50/99, 51\%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in
addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester,
which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also
completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the
9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).
Results: Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years;
27\% (27/99) of the group were male and 60\% (59/99) identified as
Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the

10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at
the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups
independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness

influenced the perception of entrepreneurship in 328 students. The
results revealed that age and study discipline played a crucial role in
shaping students' perception of their competency achievement. Younger
students tended to perceive their abilities better, while advanced
semester students were more cautious in assessing their entrepreneurial
competencies. The trend also extended to sub-competencies, with younger
students tending to perceive their social skills positively, while older
students focused more on practical knowledge such as the economic and
administrative aspects of entrepreneurship. Students in business also
tended to view their skills more positively compared to students in
other disciplines. The findings highlight the need to promote women's
social entrepreneurship and emphasize the importance of considering
these relevant elements that are crucial to the concrete reality of

article,"Artificial pigs in space: Using artificial intelligence and artificial
life techniques to design animal housing","Computer simulations have been used by us since the early 1970s to gain
an understanding of the spacing and movement patterns of confined
animals. The work has progressed from the early stages, in which we used
randomly positioned points, to current investigations of animats
(computer-simulated animals), which show low levels of learning via
artificial neural networks. We have determined that 1) pens of equal
floor area but of different shape result in different spatial and
movement patterns for randomly positioned and moving animats; 2) when
group size increases under constant density, freedom of movement
approaches an asymptote at approximately six animats; 3) matching the
number of animats with the number of corners results in optimal freedom
of movement for small groups of animats; and 4) perimeter positioning
occurs in groups of animats that maximize their distance to first- and
second-nearest neighbors. Recently, we developed animats that move,
compete for social dominance, and are motivated to obtain resources
(food, resting sites, etc.). We are currently developing an animat that
learns its behavior fi om the spatial and movement data collected on
live pigs. The animat model is then used to pretest pen designs,
followed by new pig spatial data fed into the animat model, resulting in
a new pen design to be tested, and the steps are repeated. We believe
that methodologies from artificial-life and artificial intelligence can
contribute to the understanding of basic animal behavior principles, as
well as to the solving of problems in production agriculture in areas
such as animal housing design.","Stricklin, WR and de Bourcier, P and Zhou, JZ and Gonyou, HW",animal housing; group behavior; computer simulation,No data,1998,5
article,"A Study of Network Intrusion Detection Systems Using Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning","The rapid growth of the Internet and communications has resulted in a
huge increase in transmitted data. These data are coveted by attackers
and they continuously create novel attacks to steal or corrupt these
data. The growth of these attacks is an issue for the security of our
systems and represents one of the biggest challenges for intrusion
detection. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a tool that helps to
detect intrusions by inspecting the network traffic. Although many
researchers have studied and created new IDS solutions, IDS still needs
improving in order to have good detection accuracy while reducing false
alarm rates. In addition, many IDS struggle to detect zero-day attacks.
Recently, machine learning algorithms have become popular with
researchers to detect network intrusion in an efficient manner and with
high accuracy. This paper presents the concept of IDS and provides a
taxonomy of machine learning methods. The main metrics used to assess an
IDS are presented and a review of recent IDS using machine learning is
provided where the strengths and weaknesses of each solution is
outlined. Then, details of the different datasets used in the studies

article,"The Influence of Data Length on the Performance of Artificial
Intelligence Models in Predicting Air Pollution","Air pollution is one of humanity's most critical environmental issues
and is considered contentious in several countries worldwide. As a
result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and
government decision-making for environmental management. In this study,
three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of
data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM),
and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the
hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada.
The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data
length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different
ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and
90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets
for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that
the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the
60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models.
Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise
predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital
feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential
changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results
reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting
the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly
which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving
different environmental issues.","AlOmar, Mohamed Khalid and Khaleel, Faidhalrahman and AlSaadi,

article,A muggles guide to deep learning wizardry,"Objectives: Growing interest in the applications of artificial
intelligence (AI) and, in particular, deep learning (DL) in nuclear
medicine and radiology partitions the professional community. At one end
of the spectrum are our expert DL wizards developing potion-like code
and waving the DL capabilities like a wand across our professions. On
the opposite side of the spectrum are our muggle colleagues who lack the
wizardry of DL and may be largely oblivious to the entire magical realm.
Key findings: As crafted by Arthur C Clark, any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic. DL is not only an important
technology in the future of medical imaging, but its application lives
in the capabilities of medical imaging technologists. This may be
incidental through application of techniques at the patient interface,
through role expansion in data curation and management, or as active
members of DL projects and development. Understanding the rudimentary
principles of DL is emerging as requisite in medical imaging.
Conclusion: AI and DL are valuable tools in advancing capabilities and
outcomes in medical imaging. A working knowledge of the technology and
techniques is important and achievable for the medical imaging
technologist even when capability in application of DL to research and
clinical practice is not within one's interests or scope of practice.
Implications for practice: While there is no requisite for all of the
professional community to be tutored in the wizardry of DL, there are
benefits for the profession and our patients for all to have a
rudimentary understanding of the language and landscape. The breadth of
DL literature assumes a level of understanding not evident for the bulk
of our professions. This manuscript provides a simplified primer on DL
with the aim of arming the muggles among us with sufficient insight to
navigate the magical realm of DL without transferring any wizardry

realistic digital twin of the human vertebra and predicting the risk of
vertebral fracture (VF). ReconGAN consists of a deep convolutional
generative adversarial network (DCGAN), image-processing steps, and
finite element (FE) based shape optimization to reconstruct the vertebra
model. This DCGAN model is trained using a set of quantitative
micro-computed tomography (micro-QCT) images of the trabecular bone
obtained from cadaveric samples. The quality of synthetic trabecular
models generated using DCGAN are verified by comparing a set of its
statistical microstructural descriptors with those of the imaging data.
The synthesized trabecular microstructure is then infused into the
vertebra cortical shell extracted from the patient's diagnostic CT scans
using an FE-based shape optimization approach to achieve a smooth
transition between trabecular to cortical regions. The final geometrical
model of the vertebra is converted into a high-fidelity FE model to
simulate the VF response using a continuum damage model under
compression and flexion loading conditions. A feasibility study is

L.) growth rate for precision agriculture","Rice growth rate prediction is crucial to achieve precision agriculture.
In this study, growth data from three different rice cultivars at two
different climate regions in Taiwan were used to calculate the rice
growth rate (Gr) in key growth stages. A total of 10,246 Gr data from 95
cultivations were used to assess the feasibility of simulating rice
growth rate from ambient temperature by regression algorithm (REG),
artificial neural networks (ANN) and gene-expression programming (GEP).
Simulation was carried out for each algorithm using ambient temperature
and growing season as input variables for the entire life cycle of rice
(Tr-all) either as one continuous growth period or as the sum of four
distinctive growth stages (Tr-1 similar to 4). The results showed that
the model output from Tr-1 similar to 4 are more accurate than Tr-all.
However, simulation errors in the transitional stages occurred when the
growth rate at different stages was modelled separately. Artificial
intelligence based nonlinear models were more accurate than the
regression model and ANN generally exhibited better performance than
other two models. Compared with REG, the root mean squared error (RMSE)
and mean absolute error (MAE) of averaged error-indays for the whole
growth period decreased by 41.38\% and 42.81\% in ANN and 30.14\%, and

article,"Deep learning model to detect significant aortic regurgitation using
electrocardiography","Background: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common heart disease, with a
relatively high prevalence of 4.9\% in the Framingham Heart Study.
Because the prevalence increases with advancing age, an upward shift in
the age distribution may increase the burden of AR. To provide an
effective screening method for AR, we developed a deep learning-based
artificial intelligence algorithm for the diagnosis of significant AR
using electrocardiography (ECG). Methods: Our dataset comprised 29,859
paired data of ECG and echocardiography, including 412 AR cases, from
January 2015 to December 2019. This dataset was divided into training,
validation, and test datasets. We developed a multi-input neural network
model, which comprised a two-dimensional convolutional neural network
(2D-CNN) using raw ECG data and a fully connected deep neural network
(FC-DNN) us-ing ECG features, and compared its performance with the
performances of a 2D-CNN model and other machine learning models. In
addition, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)
to identify which parts of ECG waveforms had the most effect on
algorithm decision making. Results: The area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of the multi-input model (0.802; 95\% CI,
0.762-0.837) was significantly greater than that of the 2D-CNN model
alone (0.734; 95\% CI, 0.679- 0.783; p < 0.001) and those of other
machine learning models. Grad-CAM demonstrated that the multi -input
model tended to focus on the QRS complex in leads I and aVL when
detecting AR. Conclusions: The multi-input deep learning model using
12-lead ECG data could detect significant AR with modest predictive
value. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

article,"Predicting Cognitive Presence in At-Scale Online Learning: MOOC and
For-Credit Online Course Environments","In this study, we work towards a strategy to measure and enhance the
quality of interactions in discussion forums at scale. We present a
machine learning (ML) model which identifies the phase of cognitive
presence exhibited by a student's post and suggest future applications
of such a model to help online students develop higher-order thinking.
We collect discussion forum transcript data from two online courses:
CS1301 (an introductory computer programming MOOC) offered by edX and
CS6601 (a graduate course on artificial intelligence) which uses the
Piazza online discussion tool. We manually code a random sample of
students' posts based on the Community of Inquiry coding scheme and
explore trends in cognitive presence within and across the courses. We
further use this coded data to analyze the relationship between
students' observed cognitive presence and course grades. In terms of
testing and building an ML model, we use a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers model that uses a deep learning
technique to train large text corpus and fine-tune the language model.
Our results suggest that deeper cognitive engagement with course
concepts, as expressed by higher cognitive presence, are associated with
better learning outcomes for students in both course settings. Our ML
approach achieves 92.5\% accuracy on the classification task, motivating
the use of ML for instructional interventions in online courses. We
expect that our research study will not only contribute to extending the
literature on cognitive presence but also have a beneficial impact on
online instructors or curriculum developers in higher education.","Lee, Jeonghyun and Soleimani, Farahnaz and Irish, India and Hosmer, John

article,"Multi-task learning architecture for brain tumor detection and
segmentation in MRI images","Brain tumors have existed for a long time, but their rate is increasing
among all age groups. Early detection is essential for timely prognosis
as it is a dangerous and life-threatening disease. Since the advent of
artificial intelligence and machine learning, different algorithms have
been proposed to classify and segment brain tumors. However, all have
their limitations when it comes to local deployment. The main drawback
is designing multiple architectures for multiple tasks, which increases
the time and computational complexity and affects performance. This
paper addresses this drawback by proposing a multi-task learning (MTL)
model that can take 2D-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images as input
and gives predictions for multiple outputs such as detection and
segmentation. It gives two outputs from one architecture: the system's
efficiency. Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRaTs) 2019 and BRaTs 2020 dataset
has been used to evaluate the proposed architecture. Experimental
results show that the best model shows 98\% accuracy for detecting MRI
images as either normal/abnormal, whereas an overall Dice score of 92\%
for multi-class segmentation of high-grade glioma gliomas into the whole
tumor, enhancing tumor and core tumor. The overall performance of the
proposed architecture proves that it can be the best-suited framework
for clinical setup. (c) 2022 SPIE and IS\&T","Nazir, Maria and Ali, Muhammad Junaid and Tufail, Hafiz Zahid and

Students Based on Spatiotemporal Representation Learning","Artificial intelligence and fifth generation (5G) technology are widely
adopted to evaluate the classroom poses of college students, with the
help of campus video surveillance equipment. To ensure the effective
learning in class, it is important to detect and intervene in abnormal
behaviors like sleeping and using cellphones in time. Based on
spatiotemporal representation learning, this paper presents a deep
learning algorithm to evaluate classroom poses of college students.
Firstly, feature engineering was adopted to mine the moving trajectories
of college students, which were used to determine student distribution
and establish a classroom prewarning system. Then, k-means clustering
(KMC) was employed for cluster analysis on different student groups, and
identify the features of each group. For a specific student group, the
classroom surveillance video was decomposed into several frames; the
edge of each frame was extracted by edge detection algorithm, and
imported to the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN).
Experimental results show that our algorithm is 5\% more accurate than
the benchmark three-dimensional CNN (C3D), making it an effective tool
to recognize abnormal behaviors of college students in class.","Xie, Yunfang and Zhang, Su and Liu, Yingdi","artificial intelligence; college students; pose estimation;

artificial intelligence-learned pattern recognition for rapid automated
ejection fraction","Objectives We sought to test the hypothesis that a novel 2-dimensional
echocardiographic image analysis system using artificial
intelligence-learned pattern recognition can rapidly and reproducibly
calculate ejection fraction (EF).
Background Echocardiographic EF by manual tracing is time consuming, and
visual assessment is inherently subjective.
Methods We studied 218 patients (72 female), including 165 with abnormal
left ventricular (LV) function. Auto EF incorporated a database trained
on > 10,000 human EF tracings to automatically locate and track the LV
endocardium from routine grayscale digital cineloops and calculate EF in
15 s. Auto EF results were independently compared with manually traced
biplane Simpson's rule, visual EF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
in a subset.
Results Auto EF was possible in 200 (92\%) of consecutive patients, of
which 77\% were completely automated and 23\% required manual editing.
Auto EF correlated well with manual EF (r = 0.98; 6\% limits of
agreement) and required less time per patient (48 +/- 26 s vs. 102 21 s;
p < 0.01). Auto EF correlated well with visual EF by expert readers (r =
0.96; p < 0.001), but interobserver variability was greater (3.4 +/-
2.9\% vs. 9.8 +/- 5.7\%, respectively; p < 0.001). Visual EF was less
accurate by novice readers (r = 0.82; 19\% limits of agreement) and
improved with trainee-operated Auto EF (r = 0.96; 7\% limits of
agreement). Auto EF also correlated with MRI EF (n = 21) (r = 0.95; 12\%
limits of agreement), but underestimated absolute volumes (r = 0.95;
bias of -36 +/- 27 ml overall).
Conclusions Auto EF can automatically calculate EF similarly to results
by manual biplane Simpson's rule and MRI, with less variability than
visual EF, and has clinical potential.","Cannesson, Maxime and Tanabe, Masaki and Suffoletto, Matthew S. and

in Universities Based on Artificial Intelligence","The development of precise teaching of civics with artificial
intelligence not only is the realistic need of the development of the
times and technological innovation but also provides a new picture to
solve the problem of the relevance of civics, so it is the inevitable

Curriculum Civics is an important support for the cultivation of
innovation ability of college students. To effectively identify the
state categories of college students' psychology and civics and to fully
consider the emotional factors between teachers and college students,
this paper proposes a psychological civics teaching model based on
graphical convolutional neural network. First, the dialog texts of
psychology and civics teaching between teachers and students are coded
in sequence context using Bi-GRU to obtain discourse text
representations; then, a directed graph is constructed based on the
order of the dialog between teachers and students in psychology and
civics teaching, and a new text representation vector for each discourse
text is obtained using graph convolutional neural network; finally, the
two discourse representation vectors obtained are connected, and a
similarity-based attention mechanism is used. Finally, the final
discourse text representation is obtained using an attention-based
mechanism to perform psychological and ideological state. The proposed
method is conducive to the implementation of the teaching practice

can vary substantially depending on specific clinical characteristics.
Models predicting admission and hospitalization length of stay (LoS) are
lacking. The purpose of this study was to design an effective,

for patients presenting with syncope. Methods: This was a retrospective
analysis using over 4 million patients from the National Emergency
Department Sample (NEDS) database presenting to the ED with syncope
between 2016-2019. A multilayer perceptron neural network with one
hidden layer was trained and validated on this data set. Results:
Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) were determined for each of the
five ANN models with varying cutoffs for LoS. A fair area under the
curve (AUC of 0.78) to good (AUC of 0.88) prediction performance was
achieved based on sequential analysis at different cutoff points,
starting from the same day discharge and ending at the longest analyzed
cutoff LoS <= 7 days versus >7 days, accordingly. The ML algorithm
showed significant sensitivity and specificity in predicting short (<=

their intention to adopt peer assessment. This paper presents a
quasi-experiment in which 85 participants, enrolled in the first-year of
a Computer Engineering programme, were assessed regarding their
personality and their acceptance of three modalities of peer assessment
(individual, pairs, in threes). Following a within-subjects design, the
students applied the three modalities, in a different order, with three
different activities. An analysis of the resulting 1195 observations
using ML techniques shows how the Random Forest algorithm yields
significantly better predictions for three out of the four adoption
variables included in the study. Additionally, the application of a set
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques shows that
Agreeableness is the best predictor of Usefulness and Ease of Use, while
Extraversion is the best predictor of Compatibility, and Neuroticism has
the greatest impact on global Intention to Use. The discussion
highlights how, as it happens with other innovations in educational
processes, low levels of Consciousness is the most consistent predictor
of resistance to the introduction of peer assessment processes in the
classroom. Also, it stresses the value of peer assessment to augment the
positive feelings of students scoring high on Neuroticism, which could
lead to better performance. Finally, the low impact of the peer
assessment modality on student perceptions compared to personality

methods was conducted. Specifically, 36 learners participated in this
experiment. The obtained findings highlight: (1) an innovative design
framework for OEP-based courses that teachers can refer to in their
contexts; (2) that learners had a high motivation level in terms of
knowledge achievements, individual connection and engagement when taking
the OEP-based course; and (3) several advantages and challenges of the
OEP-based course from the teacher's and learners' perspectives. For
instance, the teacher reported the fear of losing control over the
learning process when applying OEP. The findings of this paper can help
researchers and educators in adopting OEP in higher education especially
in times of crises, as well as increase the sustainability of OEP, hence
contributing to open education development.","Zhang, Xiangling and Tlili, Ahmed and Huang, Ronghuai and Chang, Tingwen

article,"Artificial Intelligence Prediction of Rutting and Fatigue Parameters in
Modified Asphalt Binders","The complex shear modulus (G{*}) and phase angle (delta) are fundamental
viscoelastic rheological properties used in the estimation of rutting
and fatigue pavement distress in asphalt binder. In the tropical
regions, rutting and fatigue cracking are major pavement distress
affecting the serviceability of road infrastructure. Laboratory testing
of the complex shear modulus and phase angle requires expensive and
advanced equipment that is not obtainable in major laboratories within
the developing countries of the region, giving rise to the need for an
accurate predictive model to support quality pavement design. This
research aims at developing a predictive model for the estimation of
rutting and fatigue susceptive of asphalt binder at intermediate and
high pavement temperatures. Asphalt rheological and ageing test was
conducted on eight mixes of modified binders used to build the study
database containing 1976 and 1668 data points for rutting and fatigue
parameters respectively. The database was divided into training and
simulation dataset. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm was
used to predict the rutting and fatigue parameters using unaged and aged
conditioned inputs. The proposed GPR was compared with the support
vector machine (SVM), recurrent neural networks (RNN) and artificial
neural network (ANN) models. Results show that the model performed
better in the estimation of rutting parameter than the fatigue
parameter. Further, unaged input variables show better reliability in
the prediction of fatigue parameter.","Uwanuakwa, Ikenna D. and Ali, Shaban Ismael Albrka and Hasan, Mohd Rosli

detection of skin cancer in community and primary care settings: a
systematic review","Skin cancers occur commonly worldwide. The prognosis and disease burden
are highly dependent on the cancer type and disease stage at diagnosis.
We systematically reviewed studies on artificial intelligence and
machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms that aim to facilitate the early
diagnosis of skin cancers, focusing on their application in primary and
community care settings. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of
Science (from Jan 1, 2000, to Aug 9, 2021) for all studies providing
evidence on applying AI/ML algorithms to the early diagnosis of skin
cancer, including all study designs and languages. The primary outcome
was diagnostic accuracy of the algorithms for skin cancers. The
secondary outcomes induded an overview of AI/ML methods, evaluation
approaches, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability to patients and
clinicians. We identified 14 224 studies. Only two studies used data
from clinical settings with a low prevalence of skin cancers. We
reported data from all 272 studies that could be relevant in primary
care. The primary outcomes shoe ed reasonable mean diagnostic accuracy
for melanoma (89.5\% {[}range 59.7-100\%]), squamous cell carcinoma
(85.3\% {[}71.0-97.8\%]), and basal cell carcinoma (87.6\% {[}70. 0-99.
7\%]). The secondary outcomes showed a heterogeneity of AI/ML methods
and study designs, with high amounts of incomplete reporting (eg,
patient demographics and methods of data collection). Few studies used
data on populations with a low prevalence of skin cancers to train and
test their algorithms; therefore, the widespread adoption into community
and primary care practice cannot currently be recommended until efficacy
in these populations is shown. We did not identify any health economic,
patient, or dinician acceptability data for any of the included studies.

article,"Predicting cervical cancer biopsy results using demographic and
epidemiological parameters: a custom stacked ensemble machine learning
approach","The human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for most cervical cancer
cases worldwide. This gynecological carcinoma causes many deaths, even
though it can be treated by removing malignant tissues at a preliminary
stage. In many developing countries, patients do not undertake medical
examinations due to the lack of awareness, hospital resources and high
testing costs. Hence, it is vital to design a computer aided diagnostic
method which can screen cervical cancer patients. In this research, we
predict the probability risk of contracting this deadly disease using a
custom stacked ensemble machine learning approach. The technique
combines the results of several machine learning algorithms on multiple
levels to produce reliable predictions. In the beginning, a deep
exploratory analysis is conducted using univariate and multivariate
statistics. Later, the one-way ANOVA, mutual information and Pearson's
correlation techniques are utilized for feature selection. Since the
data was imbalanced, the Borderline-SMOTE technique was used to balance
the data. The final stacked machine learning model obtained an accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, area under curve (AUC) and average
precision of 98\%, 97\%, 99\%, 98\%, 100\% and 100\%, respectively. To
make the model explainable and interpretable to clinicians, explainable
artificial intelligence algorithms such as Shapley additive values
(SHAP), local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME), random
forest and ELI5 have been effectively utilized. The optimistic results
indicate the potential of automated frameworks to assist doctors and

4.0 on the basis of AI training","Purpose The purpose of the paper is to determine the perspectives of
diversification of educational services in the conditions of industry
4.0 on the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) training, determine the
consequences of this process for academic and teaching staff and to
develop recommendations for its practical implementation.
Design/methodology/approach The methods of horizontal, trends and
regression analysis are used for studying social consequences of digital
modernization of the markets of higher education (for academic and
teaching staff). The research is performed by the example of modern
Russia on the basis of the statistical data of Federal State Statistics
Service and the International Telecommunication Union. The timeframe of
the research covers academic years 2000/2001-2018/2019. Findings It is
determined that digital modernization of the sphere of higher education
stimulates the reduction of the universities' need for academic and
teaching staff and growth of their unemployment. However, further
digital modernization of economy on the basis of breakthrough
technologies of industry 4.0 will lead to creation of a new type of
educational services that are provided within entrepreneurship of
universities - AI training of business. This will ensure development of
university entrepreneurship (and reduction of dependence of universities
on state financing), as well as growth of the employment opportunities
for experts (academic and teaching staff) in the sphere of AI, which
will not depend on the number of students, but will be connected to
demand for AI training from digital business. Originality/value The role
of AI training in the structure of production business processes of a
university in the conditions of industry 4.0 is determined. The
necessity for state stimulation of development of digital business in
the modern economic systems is substantiated. It is shown that
government has to pay close attention to the issues of support in the
sphere of AI and mass distribution of their results. Because of this, it
will be possible to control social risks in the sphere of higher
education.","Bogoviz, Aleksei V. and Lobova, Svetlana V. and Karp, Marina V. and

article,"Bayesian Inference and Dynamic Neural Feedback Promote the Clinical
Application of Intelligent Congenital Heart Disease Diagnosis","Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of infant death. An
artificial intelligence (AI)-based CHD diagnosis network (CHDNet) is an
echocardiogram video-based binary classification model that judges
whether echocardiogram videos contain heart defects. Existing CHDNets
have shown performances comparable to or even better than medical
experts, but their unreliability on cases outside of the training set
has become the main bottleneck for their deployment. This is a common
problem for most AI-based diagnostic approaches. Here, to overcome this
challenge, we present two essential mechanisms-Bayesian inference and
dynamic neural feedback-to respectively measure and improve the
diagnostic reliability of AI. The former easily makes the neural network
output its reliability instead of a single prediction result, while the
latter is a computational neural feedback cell that allows the neural
network to feed knowledge from the output layer back to the shallow
layers and enables the neural network to selectively activate relevant
neurons. To evaluate the effectiveness of these two mechanisms, we
trained CHDNets on 4151 echocardiogram videos containing three common
CHD defects and tested them on an internal test set of 1037
echocardiogram videos and an external set of 692 videos that were newly
collected from other cardiovascular imaging devices. Each echocardiogram
video corresponds to a unique patient and a unique visit. We demonstrate
on various neural network architectures how the reliability obtained by
Bayesian inference interprets and quantifies the significant performance
difference between internal and external test sets of neural networks,
and how the devised feedback cell helps the neural networks to maintain
high accuracy and reliability, despite the input being corrupted by
noise or when using an external test set.\& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

Performance in Virtual Learning Environment by Leveraging Explainable AI","In this research study, we propose an Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) model that provides the earliest possible global and
local interpretation of students' performance at various stages of
course length. Global and local interpretation is provided in such a way
that the prediction accuracy of a single local observation is close to
the model's overall prediction accuracy. For the earliest possible
understanding of student performance, local and global interpretation is
provided at 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% of course length. Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) which are subfields of Artificial

institution's in predicting the performance, engagement, and dropout
rate of online students. Unfortunately, traditional ML and DL techniques
lack in providing data analysis results in an understandable human way.
Explainable AI (XAI), a new branch of AI, can be used in educational
settings, specifically in VLEs, to provide the instructor with the study
performance results of thousands or even millions of online students in
a human-understandable way. Thus, unlike black box approaches such as
traditional ML and DL techniques, XAI can help instructors to interpret
the strengths and weaknesses of an individual student, providing them
with timely personalized feedback and guidance. Various traditional and
various ensemble ML algorithms were trained on demographic, clickstream,
and assessment features to determine which algorithm gives the best
performance result. The best-performing ML algorithm was ultimately
selected and provided to the XAI model as an input for local and global
interpretation of students' study behavior at various percentages of
course length. We have used various XAI tools to give students'
performance reports to instructors, in an explicable human way, at

article,"The use of deep learning towards dose optimization in low-dose computed
tomography: A scoping review","Introduction: Low-dose computed tomography tends to produce lower image
quality than normal dose computed tomography (CT) although it can help
to reduce radiation hazards of CT scanning. Research has shown that
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, especially deep learning can
help enhance the image quality of low-dose CT by denoising images. This
scoping review aims to create an overview on how AI technologies,
especially deep learning, can be used in dose optimisation for low-dose
CT.
Methods: Literature searches of ProQuest, PubMed, Cinahl, ScienceDirect,
EbscoHost Ebook Collection and Ovid were carried out to find research
articles published between the years 2015 and 2020. In addition, manual
search was conducted in SweMed+, SwePub, NORA, Taylor \& Francis Online
and Medic.
Results: Following a systematic search process, the review comprised of
16 articles. Articles were organised according to the effects of the
deep learning networks, e.g. image noise reduction, image restoration.
Deep learning can be used in multiple ways to facilitate dose
optimisation in low-dose CT. Most articles discuss image noise reduction
in low-dose CT.
Conclusion: Deep learning can be used in the optimisation of patients'
radiation dose. Nevertheless, the image quality is normally lower in
low-dose CT (LDCT) than in regular-dose CT scans because of smaller
radiation doses. With the help of deep learning, the image quality can
be improved to equate the regulardose computed tomography image quality.
Implications to practice: Lower dose may decrease patients' radiation
risk but may affect the image quality of CT scans. Artificial
intelligence technologies can be used to improve image quality in
low-dose CT scans. Radiologists and radiographers should have proper
education and knowledge about the techniques used. (C) 2021 The College

(Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio) in order to mitigate the radio
resource usage in mobile networks. Radio resource scheduling is
generally achieved on the basis of estimated channel conditions, i.e.,
SINR with the help of Sounding Reference Signals (SRS). The proposed
Non-Linear Auto Regressive External/Exogenous (NARX)-based ANN aims to
minimize the rate of sending SRS and achieves an accuracy of R = 0.87.
This can lead to vacating up to 4\% of the spectrum, improving bandwidth
efficiency and decreasing uplink power consumption.","Ullah, Ruzat and Marwat, Safdar Nawaz Khan and Ahmad, Arbab Masood and

article,Emerging Complexity in Distributed Intelligent Systems,"Distributed intelligent systems (DIS) appear where natural intelligence
agents (humans) and artificial intelligence agents (algorithms)
interact, exchanging data and decisions and learning how to evolve
toward a better quality of solutions. The networked dynamics of
distributed natural and artificial intelligence agents leads to emerging
complexity different from the ones observed before. In this study, we
review and systematize different approaches in the distributed
intelligence field, including the quantum domain. A definition and
mathematical model of DIS (as a new class of systems) and its
components, including a general model of DIS dynamics, are introduced.
In particular, the suggested new model of DIS contains both natural
(humans) and artificial (computer programs, chatbots, etc.) intelligence
agents, which take into account their interactions and communications.
We present the case study of domain-oriented DIS based on different
agents' classes and show that DIS dynamics shows complexity effects
observed in other well-studied complex systems. We examine our model by
means of the platform of personal self-adaptive educational assistants
(avatars), especially designed in our University. Avatars interact with
each other and with their owners. Our experiment allows finding an
answer to the vital question: How quickly will DIS adapt to owners'
preferences so that they are satisfied? We introduce and examine in
detail learning time as a function of network topology. We have shown
that DIS has an intrinsic source of complexity that needs to be
addressed while developing predictable and trustworthy systems of
natural and artificial intelligence agents. Remarkably, our research and
findings promoted the improvement of the educational process at our

article,"Automated segmentation of the larynx on computed tomography images: a
review","The larynx, or the voice-box, is a common site of occurrence of Head and
Neck cancers. Yet, automated segmentation of the larynx has been
receiving very little attention. Segmentation of organs is an essential
step in cancer treatment-planning. Computed Tomography scans are
routinely used to assess the extent of tumor spread in the Head and Neck
as they are fast to acquire and tolerant to some movement. This paper
reviews various automated detection and segmentation methods used for
the larynx on Computed Tomography images. Image registration and deep
learning approaches to segmenting the laryngeal anatomy are compared,
highlighting their strengths and shortcomings. A list of available
annotated laryngeal computed tomography datasets is compiled for
encouraging further research. Commercial software currently available
for larynx contouring are briefed in our work. We conclude that the lack
of standardisation on larynx boundaries and the complexity of the
relatively small structure makes automated segmentation of the larynx on
computed tomography images a challenge. Reliable computer aided
intervention in the contouring and segmentation process will help
clinicians easily verify their findings and look for oversight in
diagnosis. This review is useful for research that works with artificial

cardiomyopathies","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) are two
common types of cardiomyopathies leading to heart failure. Accurate
diagnostic classification of different types of cardiomyopathies is
critical for precision medicine in clinical practice. In this study, we
hypothesized that machine learning (ML) can be used as a novel
diagnostic approach to analyze cardiac transcriptomic data for
classifying clinical cardiomyopathies. RNA-Seq data of human left
ventricle tissues were collected from 41 DCM patients, 47 ICM patients,
and 49 nonfailure controls (NF) and tested using five ML algorithms:
support vector machine with radial kernel (svmRadial), neural networks
with principal component analysis (pcaNNet), decision tree (DT), elastic
net (ENet), and random forest (RF). Initial ML classifications achieved
similar to 93\% accuracy (svmRadial) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 82\%
accuracy (RF) for NF vs. ICM, and similar to 80\% accuracy (ENet and
svmRadial) for DCM vs. ICM. Next, 50 highly contributing genes (HCGs)
for classifying NF and DCM, 68 HCGs for classifying NF and ICM, and 59
HCGs for classifying DCM and ICM were selected for retraining ML models.
Impressively, the retrained models achieved similar to 90\% accuracy
(RF) for NF vs. DCM, similar to 90\% accuracy (pcaNNet) for NF vs. ICM,
and similar to 85\% accuracy (pcaNNet and RF) for DCM vs. ICM. Pathway
analyses further confirmed the involvement of those selected HCGs in
cardiac dysfunctions such as cardiomyopathies, cardiac hypertrophies,

(AI)-enabled mobile banking applications: an extension of AI
characteristics to an expectation confirmation model","Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to be a disruptive
financial technology in the context of mobile banking that can provide
more practical value to users and banks. AI is a critical way of
facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications
(apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users'
continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not
been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation
model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a
research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI
characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived
anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users' continuance
intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a
random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least
squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that
both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction
via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users'
willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers
theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking

and Iterative Radiology-Pathology Correlation","Purpose: Radiology-pathology correlation has long been foundational to
continuing education, peer learning, quality assurance, and
multidisciplinary patient care. The objective of this study was to
determine whether modern deep-learning language-modeling techniques
could reliably match pathology reports to pertinent radiology reports.
Methods: The recently proposed Universal Language Model Fine-Tuning for
Text Classification methodology was used. Two hundred thousand radiology
and pathology reports were used for adaptation to the
radiology-pathology space. One hundred thousand candidate
radiology-pathology pairs, evenly split into match and no-match
categories, were used for training the final binary classification
model. Matches were defined by a previous-generation artificial
intelligence anatomic concept radiology-pathology correlation system.
Results: The language model rapidly adapted very closely to the prior
anatomic concept-matching approach, with 100\% specificity, 65.1\%
sensitivity, and 73.7\% accuracy. For comparison, the previous
methodology, which was intentionally designed to be specific at the
expense of sensitivity, had 98.0\% specificity, 65.1\% sensitivity, and
73.2\% accuracy.
Conclusions: Modern deep-learning language-modeling approaches are
promising for radiology-pathology correlation. Because of their rapid
adaptation to underlying training labels, these models advance previous
artificial intelligence work in that they can be continuously improved
and tuned to improve performance and adjust to user and site-level

We conducted an analysis on 4 published papers (ie, examples 1-4)
encompassing various study designs and approaches for calculating sample
size in 3 sportscience and -medicine journals, including 3 randomized
controlled trials and 1 survey paper. We provided ChatGPT with all
necessary data such as mean, percentage SD, normal deviates (Z \&
alpha;/2 and Z1-\& beta;), and study design. Prompting from 1 example
has subsequently been reused to gain insights into the reproducibility
of the ChatGPT response. Results: ChatGPT correctly calculated the
sample size for 1 randomized controlled trial but failed in the
remaining 3 examples, including the incorrect identification of the
formula in one example of a survey paper. After interaction with
ChatGPT, the correct sample size was obtained for the survey paper.
Intriguingly, when the prompt from Example 3 was reused, ChatGPT
provided a completely different sample size than its initial response.
Conclusions: While the use of artificial-intelligence tools holds great
promise, it should be noted that it might lead to errors and
inconsistencies in sample-size calculations even when the tool is fed
with the necessary correct information. As artificial-intelligence
technology continues to advance and learn from human feedback, there is
hope for improvement in sample-size calculation and other research
tasks. However, it is important for scientists to exercise caution in
utilizing these tools. Future studies should assess more

article,"Application of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in
the numerical investigation of Cu/water nanofluid convective flow","The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling is an applicable tool
for the prediction of fluid flow characteristics (velocity, temperature,
pressure, etc.). However, CFD requires a lot of time, computational
efforts and as a result, much more expenses for complicated cases (e.g.
turbulent flow, 3-dimensional calculations, etc.). The present work
tries to conduct an investigation on the potential of the artificial
intelligence algorithms in overcoming such barriers of CFD modeling.
Turbulent forced convection of Cu/water nanofluid in a tube under
constant heat flux is considered as a case study for the model
development. The density and viscosity of the based fluid are enhanced
by the suspension of the nanoparticles. This makes more pressure drop
and as a result, imposes more pumping power. So, this paper is focused
on a way to facilitate the prediction of the pressure of the nanofluid
convective flow. The results of the CFD modeling are learned by the
adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), as the artificial
intelligence method. The CFD modeling is done for several Cu
nanoparticle volume fractions (i.e. 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1, and 2). Several
types of variables as inputs (i.e. x, y, z, and nanoparticle volume
fraction) and different kinds of membership functions (i.e. Generalized
bell-shaped membership function (gbellmf), Gaussian membership function
(gaussmf), Gaussian combination membership function (gauss2mf),
Difference between two sigmoidal membership functions (dsigmf), Product
of two sigmoidal membership functions (psigmf)) are examined until the
intelligence requirements of the ANFIS are satisfied. Once the best
intelligence of ANFIS has been achieved, there is no need for
complicated CFD modeling. The ANFIS predictions show the highest
compatibility with the CFD results. The maximum pressure drop was
predicted around 1500 Pa. The results also revealed that for checking
the intelligence condition the coefficient of determination (R-2) is not
solely sufficient and the error values must be considered as well.
Considering the gauss2mf as the membership function and the nanoparticle
volume fraction as the fourth input, the ANFIS could distinguish
intelligently the pattern of data (changing the pressure with
coordinates and particle fraction). For the best intelligence, the mean
standard error was around zero, while the coefficient of determination
was close to one. At this condition, the pressure of the nanofluid could
be determined as a function of the nanoparticle volume fraction and
anywhere inside the tube without using the CFD modeling.","Marjani, Azam and Babanezhad, Meisam and Shirazian, Saeed",Nanofluid; Convective flow; CFD; Artificial intelligence; ANFIS,10.1016/j.csite.2020.100793,2020,No data

Lay Summary Data analytics have evolved remarkably. This paper discussed
the evolution of data analytics from a competitive advantage perspective
within academia and illustrated the combination of different advanced
technological systems in developing hybrid intelligent mechanistic
models (HIMM). Data analytics tools are divided into 3 stages. The first
stage (collect and respond) ensures that data are correct and free of
influential data points, and it represents the data and information
phases for which data are cataloged and organized. The second stage
(predict and prescribe) results in gained knowledge from the data and
comprises most predictive modeling paradigms, and optimization and risk
assessment tools are used to prescribe future decision-making
opportunities. The third stage (smart learning and policy making) aims
to apply the information obtained in the previous stages to foment
knowledge and use it for rational decisions. Although still incipient,
HIMM form the forthcoming stage of competitive advantage. HIMM may not
increase our ability to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling
the outcomes of a system, but it may increase the predictive ability of
existing models by helping the analyst explain more of the data
variation. The scientific community needs to resolve the lack of
transparency and reporting of artificial intelligence for code
reproducibility.
A renewed interest in data analytics and decision support systems in
developing automated computer systems is facilitating the emergence of
hybrid intelligent systems by combining artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms with classical modeling paradigms such as mechanistic
modeling (HIMM) and agent-based models (iABM). Data analytics have

assumptions might need to be re-assessed to provide a more thorough
competitive advantage in animal production systems towards

the combination of different advanced technological systems in
developing HIMM. The progress of analytical tools was divided into three

article,Machine learning meets genome assembly,"Motivation: With the recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies, the
study of the genetic composition of living organisms has become more
accessible for researchers. Several advances have been achieved because
of it, especially in the health sciences. However, many challenges which
emerge from the complexity of sequencing projects remain unsolved. Among
them is the task of assembling DNA fragments from previously unsequenced
organisms, which is classified as an NP-hard (nondeterministic
polynomial time hard) problem, for which no efficient computational
solution with reasonable execution time exists. However, several tools
that produce approximate solutions have been used with results that have
facilitated scientific discoveries, although there is ample room for
improvement. As with other NP-hard problems, machine learning algorithms
have been one of the approaches used in recent years in an attempt to
find better solutions to the DNA fragment assembly problem, although
still at a low scale.

comprising artificial intelligence-based DNA assemblers-particularly the
ones that use machine learning-to provide an overview of

article,"Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes
in head and neck cancer","Advances in technical radiotherapy have resulted in significant sparing
of organs at risk (OARs), reducing radiation-related toxicities for
patients with cancer of the head and neck (HNC). Accurate delineation of
target volumes (TVs) and OARs is critical for maximising tumour control
and minimising radiation toxicities. When performed manually,
variability in TV and OAR delineation has been shown to have significant
dosimetric impacts for patients on treatment. Auto-segmentation (AS)
techniques have shown promise in reducing both inter-practitioner
variability and the time taken in TV and OAR delineation in HNC.
Ultimately, this may reduce treatment planning and clinical waiting
times for patients. Adaptation of radiation treatment for biological or
anatomical changes during therapy will also require rapid re-planning;
indeed, the time taken for manual delineation currently prevents
adaptive radiotherapy from being implemented optimally. We are therefore
standing on the threshold of a transformation of routine radiotherapy
planning via the use of artificial intelligence. In this article, we
outline the current state-of-the-art for AS for HNC radiotherapy in
order to predict how this will rapidly change with the introduction of
artificial intelligence. We specifically focus on delineation accuracy
and time saving. We argue that, if such technologies are implemented
correctly, AS should result in better standardisation of treatment for
patients and significantly reduce the time taken to plan radiotherapy.

Identification of Early Cancerous Lesions in the Esophagus: A Pilot
Study","Simple Summary
Detection of early esophageal cancer is important to improve patient's
survival, but accurate diagnosis of superficial esophageal neoplasms is
difficult even for experienced endoscopists. Computer-aided diagnostic
system is believed to be an important method to provide accurate and
rapid assistance for endoscopists in diagnosing esophageal neoplasms. We
developed a single-shot multibox detector using a convolutional neural
network for diagnosing esophageal cancer by using endoscopic images and
the aim of our study was to assess the ability of our system. Our system
showed good diagnostic performance in detecting as well as
differentiating esophageal neoplasms and the accuracy can achieve 90\%.
Differentiating different histological grades of esophageal neoplasm is
usually conducted by magnified endoscopy and we confirm that artificial
intelligence system has great potential for helping endoscopists in
accurately diagnosing superficial esophageal neoplasms without the
necessity of magnified endoscopy and experienced endoscopists.
Diagnosis of early esophageal neoplasia, including dysplasia and
superficial cancer, is a great challenge for endoscopists. Recently, the
application of artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning in the
endoscopic field has made significant advancements in diagnosing
gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we constructed a
single-shot multibox detector using a convolutional neural network for
diagnosing different histological grades of esophageal neoplasms and
evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of this computer-aided system. A total
of 936 endoscopic images were used as training images, and these images
included 498 white-light imaging (WLI) and 438 narrow-band imaging (NBI)
images. The esophageal neoplasms were divided into three
classifications: squamous low-grade dysplasia, squamous high-grade
dysplasia, and squamous cell carcinoma, based on pathological diagnosis.
This AI system analyzed 264 test images in 10 s, and the sensitivity,
specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of this system in detecting
esophageal neoplasms were 96.2\%, 70.4\%, and 90.9\%, respectively. The
accuracy of this AI system in differentiating the histological grade of
esophageal neoplasms was 92\%. Our system showed better accuracy in
diagnosing NBI (95\%) than WLI (89\%) images. Our results showed the
great potential of AI systems in identifying esophageal neoplasms as
well as differentiating histological grades.","Wang, Yao-Kuang and Syu, Hao-Yi and Chen, Yi-Hsun and Chung, Chen-Shuan

attractive for numerous applications. In this paper, we optimize
artificial intelligence techniques to provide clear, and natural
biomedical imaging. We demonstrate that a deep learning-enabled
super-resolution method can significantly enhance the spatial resolution

trains a generative adversarial network to transform low-resolution

regular-microscopic images acquired with different optical microscopes
under various magnifications are collected as our experimental benchmark
datasets. The only input to this generative-adversarial-network-based
method are images from the datasets down-sampled by the Bicubic
interpolation. We use independent test sets to evaluate this deep
learning approach with other deep learning-based algorithms through
qualitative and quantitative comparisons. To clearly present the
improvements achieved by this generative-adversarial-network-based
method, we zoom into the local features to explore and highlight the
qualitative differences. We also employ the peak signal-to-noise ratio
and the structural similarity, to quantitatively compare alternative
super-resolution methods. The quantitative results illustrate that
super-resolution images obtained from our approach with interpolation
parameter alpha = 0.25 more closely match those of the original
high-resolution images than to those obtained by any of the alternative
state-of-the-art method. These results are significant for fields that
use microscopy tools, such as biomedical imaging of engineered living

for rotating machinery exploiting augmented synthetic data","Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost
reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring
rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of
the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data
(e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset's operating
condition. Three major problems hinder the application of AI models in
industrial environments, being the motivation for the research: (i)
impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational
conditions (since faults rarely happen), (ii) high cost of experts to
label all acquired data (in a supervised scenario) and (iii) lack of
interpretability of the models (black-boxes). To overcome these
problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying
faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented
synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namely
FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide
scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are
created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation.
The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the post hoc
interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and
increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only
obtained promising diagnostic performance but was also able to learn
characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source
domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results
obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults
suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer

fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster
research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.","Brito, Lucas Costa and Susto, Gian Antonio and Brito, Jorge Nei and

convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pre-trained on non-medical images,
can be used for automated fracture detection on plain radiographs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The top layer of the Inception v3 network was
re-trained using lateral wrist radiographs to produce a model for the
classification of new studies as either ``fracture{''} or ``no
fracture{''}. The model was trained on a total of 11,112 images, after
an eightfold data augmentation technique, from an initial set of 1,389
radiographs (695 ``fracture{''} and 694 ``no fracture{''}). The training
data set was split 80:10:10 into training, validation, and test groups,
respectively. An additional 100 wrist radiographs, comprising 50
``fracture{''} and 50 ``no fracture{''} images, were used for final
testing and statistical analysis.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)
for this test was 0.954. Setting the diagnostic cut-off at a threshold
designed to maximise both sensitivity and specificity resulted in values
of 0.9 and 0.88, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The AUC scores for this test were comparable to

The Lucia Atrial Fibrillation Application (Lucia App) photographs the

scores, and then provides guideline-recommended anticoagulation. Our
purpose was to determine the rate of accurate AF identification and
appropriate anticoagulation recommendations in emergency department (ED)
patients ultimately diagnosed with AF. Methods We performed a
single-center, observational retrospective chart review in an urban
California ED, with an annual census of 70,000 patients. A convenience
sample of hospitalized patients with AF as a primary or secondary
discharge diagnosis were evaluated for accurate ED AF diagnosis and ED
anticoagulation rates. This was done by comparing the Lucia App against

American College of Emergency Physicians AF anticoagulation guidelines.
Results Two hundred and ninety seven patients were enrolled from January
2016 until December 2019. The median age was 79 years and 44.1\% were
female. Compared to the gold standard diagnosis, the Lucia App detected
AF in 98.3\% of the cases. Physicians recommended guideline-consistent
anticoagulation therapy in 78.5\% versus 98.3\% for the Lucia App. Of
the patients with indications for anticoagulation and discharged from
the ED, only 25.0\% were started at discharge. Conclusion Use of a

article,"Improving solar forecasting using Deep Learning and Portfolio Theory
integration","Solar energy has been consolidated as one of the main renewable energy
sources capable of contributing to supply global energy demand. However,
the solar resource has intermittent feature in electricity production,
making it difficult to manage the electrical system. Hence, we propose
the application of Deep Learning (DL), one of the emerging themes in the
field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as a solar predictor. To attest
its capacity, the technique is compared with other consolidated solar
forecasting strategies such as Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Base
Function and Support Vector Regression. Additionally, integration of AI
methods in a new adaptive topology based on the Portfolio Theory (PT) is
proposed hereby to improve solar forecasts. PT takes advantage of
diversified forecast assets: when one of the assets shows prediction
errors, these are offset by another asset. After testing with data from
Spain and Brazil, results show that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error
(MAPE) for predictions using DL is 6.89\% and for the proposed
integration (called PrevPT) is 5.36\% concerning data from Spain. For
the data from Brazil, MAPE for predictions using DL is 6.08\% and 4.52\%
for PrevPT. In both cases, DL and PrevPT results are better than the
other techniques being used. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Lima, Marcello Anderson F. B. and Carvalho, Paulo C. M. and

article,"A hybrid intelligent model for acute hypotensive episode prediction with
large-scale data","Acute hypotensive episode (AHE) is a common serious postoperative
complication in ICU, which may raise multiple system failure (especially
of cardiac and respiratory kinds), and even cause death. Timely and
effective clinical intervention is obviously vital to the saving of
patients. AHE detection involves physiological time-series monitoring,
processing and prediction technologies, which can offer insights to
neuroscientists, biologists, and even provide support for clinicians.
This paper presents a hybrid artificial intelligence model combined with
CEEMDAN (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive
noise, a typical method for physiological signal decomposition), deep
learning, multiple gene expression programming and fuzzy expert system
for AHE detection. In this paper, the physiological signal is selected
from a benchmark dataset, for example MIMIC-II (Multiparameter
Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II), which collects large scale
real patients' data for clinical research. In the hybrid model, a
typical signal decomposition method is employed for AHE signal
processing, and an autoencoder based deep neural network is established
for feature extraction. Finally, a reliable and explainable classifier
is presented by fusing gene expression programming and the fuzzy method.
Experimental results based on real data set demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms stateof-the-art AHE detection methods by
achieving the prediction accuracy of 88.14\% in 2866 records. (c) 2020

article,"Academic literacy among the university students in Mexico and Spain: A
holistic perspective","IntroductionCurrently, young people have access to a large amount of
information, so they must have the ability to critically analyze the
texts they are exposed to in order to choose those that are useful for
their training or research process, as well as to have the necessary
skills to interact efficiently with the texts, especially with those
specialized documents corresponding to their area of study. In this
regard, this article aims to identify how cognitive, emotional,
attitudinal, digital and personality aspects influence the development
of academic literacy skills in university students. MethodResearch was
conducted with the mixed method, in which quantitative instruments were
applied and analyzed: a Likert scale questionnaire to measure the
perceived level of mastery of academic literacy skills, which was
applied to a sample of 595 students from higher education institutions
in Mexico and Spain. In addition, a test was applied to identify
personality type. For the qualitative part, the case study was chosen
and the qualitative instruments applied were interviews with a teacher
and a student and a focus group with five students. ResultsThe findings
identified were as follows: (a) the cognitive aspect of academic
literacy is the one with the lowest perceived mastery by students, (b)
having a positive attitude favors the development of academic literacy,
(c) by knowing the aspects of their personality that can favor the
development of academic literacy, students can seek strategies to
improve that competency, (d) the emotional part has repercussions in the
process of developing the competence of academic literacy, (e) students
prefer to interact with texts in digital spaces and therefore must learn
to interact critically in virtual environments, (f) Mexican students
perceive themselves to have a higher level of mastery of the academic
literacy competency than Spanish students. ConclusionThe literature

article,"College English Reading Teaching Integrating Production Oriented
Approach from the Perspective of Artificial Intelligence","The objectives are to solve many problems in traditional English reading
teaching, such as the passive acceptance of students' learning
situation, the rigid teaching mode of teachers and the difficulty in
taking into account the individual needs of each student, and the forced
averaging of students' English learning ability and level. Firstly, a
detection method of English reading level based on the Backpropagation
neural network (BPNN) is designed. Secondly, the teaching process and
specific teaching plan are designed with the Production Oriented
Approach (POA). Finally, the detection method of English reading level
is verified by simulation experiments, and the effect of the teaching
method integrating POA is analyzed. The results show that (1) when the
learning rate is 0.26 and the training time is 1000 times, the mean
square error (MSE) of the model is the smallest. (2) The results of the
practical experiment indicate that the number of people who sign up for
the college English proficiency test, the number of actual exams, and
the pass rate of the test in the experimental group using the teaching
method are higher than those in the control group. Moreover, the number
of people in the experimental group increased more than that in the
control group after the experiment. There is no significant difference
in the test results of the two groups before the experiment, and the
average test scores of the experimental group are obviously higher than
those of the control group after the experiment. The p value of the two
groups of results is less than 0.05 in the t-test, indicating that there
is a significant difference in the English reading level between the two
groups after the experiment. Simultaneously, the difference between the
results of class A before and after the experiment is larger than that
of class B, showing that the teaching method integrating POA is more
effective for students with higher English levels. Therefore, compared
with the traditional teaching method, the teaching mode integrating POA
is more effective in improving the English reading level of college
students. It aims to transform POA theory into practice and provide a
great reference for college English reading teaching.","Wang, Xi and Yan, Ke",No data,10.1155/2022/3411203,2022,No data
article,Applying machine learning to automatically assess scientific models,"Involving students in scientific modeling practice is one of the most
effective approaches to achieving the next generation science education
learning goals. Given the complexity and multirepresentational features
of scientific models, scoring student-developed models is time- and
cost-intensive, remaining one of the most challenging assessment
practices for science education. More importantly, teachers who rely on
timely feedback to plan and adjust instruction are reluctant to use
modeling tasks because they could not provide timely feedback to
learners. This study utilized machine learning (ML), the most advanced
artificial intelligence (AI), to develop an approach to automatically
score student-drawn models and their written descriptions of those
models. We developed six modeling assessment tasks for middle school
students that integrate disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting
concepts with the modeling practice. For each task, we asked students to
draw a model and write a description of that model, which gave students
with diverse backgrounds an opportunity to represent their understanding
in multiple ways. We then collected student responses to the six tasks
and had human experts score a subset of those responses. We used the
human-scored student responses to develop ML algorithmic models (AMs)
and to train the computer. Validation using new data suggests that the
machine-assigned scores achieved robust agreements with human consent
scores. Qualitative analysis of student-drawn models further revealed
five characteristics that might impact machine scoring accuracy:
Alternative expression, confusing label, inconsistent size, inconsistent
position, and redundant information. We argue that these five
characteristics should be considered when developing machine-scorable
modeling tasks.","Zhai, Xiaoming and He, Peng and Krajcik, Joseph","artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks; deep learning;

pace in research laboratories both at academic institutions and in
industry. Important artificial intelligence (AI) tools for diagnostic
imaging include algorithms for disease detection and classification,
image optimization, radiation reduction, and workflow enhancement.
Although advances in foundational research are occurring rapidly,
translation to routine clinical practice has been slower. In August
2018, the National Institutes of Health assembled multiple relevant
stakeholders at a public meeting to discuss the current state of
knowledge, infrastructure gaps, and challenges to wider implementation.
The conclusions of that meeting are summarized in two publications that
identify and prioritize initiatives to accelerate foundational and
translational research in AI for medical imaging. This publication
summarizes key priorities for translational research developed at the
workshop including: (1) creating structured AI use cases, defining and
highlighting clinical challenges potentially solvable by AI; (2)
establishing methods to encourage data sharing for training and testing
AI algorithms to promote generalizability to widespread clinical
practice and mitigate unintended bias; (3) establishing tools for
validation and performance monitoring of AI algorithms to facilitate
regulatory approval; and (4) developing standards and common data
elements for seamless integration of AI tools into existing clinical
workflows. An important goal of the resulting road map is to grow an
ecosystem, facilitated by professional societies, industry, and

the Teaching Reform of Physical Education Students in Colleges and

education teaching in colleges and universities has to be promoted day
by day. The most important task in the process of reform is how to
improve the quality of physical education teaching. Only by reforming
colleges and universities can we transport outstanding talents into the
society. It is very important to improve the teaching quality by
improving the physical education quality evaluation system. As
artificial intelligence technology has been more and more widely used in
different fields, various educational administration systems based on
information management have been established in various colleges and
universities. On the one hand, it has brought great convenience to the
management of physical education in colleges and universities and
improvement of the efficiency of sports education management, but on the
other hand, there are many shortcomings in the process of practical
application. For example, the application of the database does not fully
reflect its function and convenience, and it is only used at the level
of query and statistics. Therefore, a better evaluation system of
physical education teaching quality has become the common expectation of
all colleges and universities. This paper makes a powerful analysis of
the current quality evaluation of physical education in colleges and
universities and proposes a method of establishing a basic framework
through expert systems, filling in details with the idea of knowledge
base and fuzzy sets, and further using a three-layer B/S framework model
to design universal teaching quality assessment system. When discussing
the requirements, functional framework, and actual development of the
teaching evaluation system, the characteristics of the traditional
physical education evaluation model are deeply analyzed, and the
system's interactivity, flexibility, accuracy, and fairness are
emphasized in the implementation process. Object-oriented design and
analysis are carried out on the requirements of the system, and finally,

article,Blessing of dimensionality at the edge and geometry of few-shot learning,"In this paper we present theory and algorithms enabling classes of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to continuously and incrementally
improve with a priori quantifiable guarantees-or more specifically
remove classification errors-over time. This is distinct from
state-of-the-art machine learning, AI, and software approaches. The
theory enables building few-shot AI correction algorithms and provides
conditions justifying their successful application. Another feature of
this approach is that, in the supervised setting, the computational
complexity of training is linear in the number of training samples. At
the time of classification, the computational complexity is bounded by
few inner product calculations. Moreover, the implementation is shown to
be very scalable. This makes it viable for deployment in applications
where computational power and memory are limited, such as embedded
environments. It enables the possibility for fast on-line optimisation
using improved training samples. The approach is based on the
concentration of measure effects and stochastic separation theorems and
is illustrated with an example on the identification faulty processes in
Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling and with a case study on
adaptive removal of false positives in an industrial video surveillance
and analytics system.

article,"Prediction of Driver Gene Matching in Lung Cancer NOG/PDX Models Based
on Artificial Intelligence","Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDXs) are a powerful tool for drug
discovery and screening in cancer. However, current studies have led to
little understanding of genotype mismatches in PDXs, leading to massive
economic losses. Here, we established PDX models from 53 lung cancer
patients with a genotype matching rate of 79.2\% (42/53). Furthermore,
17 clinicopathological features were examined and input in stepwise
logistic regression (LR) models based on the lowest Akaike information
criterion (AIC), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
(LASSO)-LR, support vector machine (SVM) recursive feature elimination
(SVM-RFE), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting and
categorical features (CatBoost), and the synthetic minority oversampling
technique (SMOTE). Finally, the performance of all models was evaluated
by the accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC), and F1 score in 100 testing groups. Two multivariable LR models
revealed that age, number of driver gene mutations, epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, type of prior chemotherapy, prior
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, and the source of the sample
were powerful predictors. Moreover, CatBoost (mean accuracy = 0.960;
mean AUC = 0.939; mean F1 score = 0.908) and the eight-feature SVM-RFE
(mean accuracy = 0.950; mean AUC = 0.934; mean F1 score = 0.903) showed
the best performance among the algorithms. Meanwhile, application of the
SMOTE improved the predic-tive capability of most models, except
CatBoost. Based on the SMOTE, the ensemble classifier of single models
achieved the highest accuracy (mean = 0.975), AUC (mean = 0.949), and F1
score (mean = 0.938). In conclusion, we established an optimal
predictive model to screen lung cancer patients for non-obese diabetic

most common mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). KRAS(G12C)
inhibitors are promising for NSCLC treatment, but their weaker activity
in resistant tumors is their drawback. This study aims to identify new
KRAS(G12C) inhibitors from among the FDA-approved covalent drugs by
taking advantage of artificial intelligence. The machine learning models
were constructed using an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm.
The models can predict KRAS(G12C) inhibitors well, with an accuracy
score of validation = 0.85 and Q(Ext)(2) = 0.76. From 67 FDA-covalent
drugs, afatinib, dacomitinib, acalabrutinib, neratinib, zanubrutinib,

Afatinib obtained the highest predictive log-inhibitory concentration at

inhibitors. Only afatinib, neratinib, and zanubrutinib covalently bond
at the active site like the KRAS(G12C) inhibitors in the KRAS(G12C)
protein (PDB ID: 6OIM). Moreover, afatinib, neratinib, and zanubrutinib
exhibited a distance deviation between the KRAS(G2C) protein-ligand
complex similar to the KRAS(G12C) inhibitors. Therefore, afatinib,
neratinib, and zanubrutinib could be used as drug candidates against the

human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms
has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI)
algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still
markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly
because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it
has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal
utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context,
there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI).
Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and
addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand
deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically
developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best
understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug
discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from
AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert
review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to
traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not
only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that
are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include
digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of
health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt
diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with
consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for
integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to
replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such
expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible
innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from
prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of
automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on
scientific cultures, work force, and society at large.","Dzobo, Kevin and Adotey, Sampson and Thomford, Nicholas E. and Dzobo,

article,"Quantification of river total phosphorus using integrative artificial
intelligence models","Total phosphorus (T-P) refers to the concentration of phosphorus in
water and is one of the important parameters for eutrophication in lakes
and rivers. In current research, neuroscience dependent (i.e., singular
and doubleplatform synthetic) approaches were employed to predict the
river T-P concentration. Singular techniques were developed utilizing
machine learning based (support vector machines (SVMs), stochastic
gradient boosting (SGB)), and deep learning based multilayer perceptron
(DMLP) models. Besides, double-platform synthetic techniques were
developed by integrating a prior data-processing (Discrete-wavelet)
algorithm with the singular techniques. Six input scenarios conditional
on different water quantity and quality parameters acquired from two
stations (Hwangji and Toilchun), South Korea, were employed for
appraising singular and double-platform synthetic techniques. The
various promoted models were evaluated using four statistical standards
viz., mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), scatter
index (SI), and Pearson correlation coefficient (CCp), and four visual
references viz., scatter diagram, box-and-whisker plot, violin plot, and
Taylor diagram. It can be indicated from the outcomes that the
double-platform synthetic techniques did not always lead to more
accurate predictions than the singular techniques. Further, results also
supplied that the SGB with the 6th input (MAE = 0.012 mg/L, RMSE = 0.014
mg/L, and CCp = 0.650 for Hwangji; MAE = 0.011 mg/L, RMSE = 0.017 mg/L,
and CCp = 0.963 for Toilchun) scenario model demonstrated the best
accuracy for predicting river T-P concentration by the singular
techniques for both stations, whereas the discrete-wavelet SVMs with the
4th input (MAE = 0.007 mg/L, RMSE = 0.011 mg/L, and CCp = 0.765 for
Hwangji) and discrete-wavelet SGB with the 5th input (MAE = 0.012 mg/L,

article,"Smart Blended Learning Framework based on Artificial Intelligence using
MobileNet Single Shot Detector and Centroid Tracking Algorithm","The Covid-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of human life and has
even forced humans to shift their life habits, including in the world of
education. The learning model must shift from the traditional
face-to-face pattern to a modern face-to-face pattern or an asynchronous
pattern with information technology-based applications. Blended learning
is one of the appropriate solutions to adjust the limited face-to-face
learning conditions. Blended learning can be done, for example, by
scheduling learning by dividing the number of participants by 50\% and
entering on a scheduled basis. However, the problem is that the time and
effort used are less efficient. Blended learning can also be done by
conducting learning simultaneously with 50\% of students in class and
the remaining 50\% through conferences. This concept will streamline the
time and effort used. However, the problem is that there is a gap in the
learning experience between students in class and students who do
learning via conference. This innovative blended learning system
framework is proposed to overcome these problems. The system built seeks
to present an online learning experience atmosphere so that it is
expected to be able to resemble an offline learning atmosphere. We
created a system using camera technology and object detection that will
track the movement of the teacher so that the teacher can move freely in
the room without having to be stuck in front of the computer holding the

To improve the employment rate of college students, we should first
educate each college student in career planning, so that they can
clearly understand their own positioning and future development

deep learning is formed. Finally, the performance of the model under the
traditional algorithm and the optimized information recommendation model
is evaluated, and the satisfaction of users to this system is scored so

tongue lesions and were also able to distinguish between five types of
tongue lesions, i.e. hairy tongue, fissured tongue, geographic tongue,
strawberry tongue and oral hairy leukoplakia with high classification

students: Stakeholder perspectives","The worldwide prevalence of anxiety disorders among college students is
high, which negatively affects countries, schools, families, and
individual students to varying degrees. This paper reviews the relevant
literature regarding risk factors and digital interventions for anxiety
disorders among college students from the perspectives of different
stakeholders. Risk factors at the national and societal levels include
class differences and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
College-level risk factors include the indoor environment design of the
college environment, peer relationships, student satisfaction with
college culture, and school functional levels. Family-level risk factors
include parenting style, family relationship, and parental level of
education. Individual-level risk factors include biological factors,
lifestyle, and personality. Among the intervention options for college
students' anxiety disorders, in addition to traditional cognitive
behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, psychological
counseling, and group counseling, digital mental health interventions
are increasingly popular due to their low cost, positive effect, and
convenient diagnostics and treatment. To better apply digital
intervention to the prevention and treatment of college students'
anxiety, this paper suggests that the different stakeholders form a
synergy among themselves. The nation and society should provide
necessary policy guarantees, financial support, and moral and ethical
supervision for the prevention and treatment of college students'
anxiety disorders. Colleges should actively participate in the screening
and intervention of college students' anxiety disorders. Families should
increase their awareness of college students' anxiety disorders and take
the initiative to study and understand various digital intervention
methods. College students with anxiety disorders should actively seek
psychological assistance and actively accept and participate in digital
intervention projects and services. We believe that in the future, the

practice of mobile learning (m-learning) and gameplay in education. This
paper presents the findings of a study that examined the effect on
achievement and explored student perception towards quiz-game play prior
to an anatomy assessment in first year Higher Education students.
Achievement data was collected over two academic years at all module
assessment (A1-A4) points. A1 was used as a baseline, showing no
difference between groups or years, A2 and A3 were comparable online
assessments done on the lower and upper limbs that followed the same
format; A4 was a viva-voce to assess the whole module learning. The
optional 15-minute quiz-gameplay intervention (G) using a mobile
application was initiated prior to A3, those students who chose not to
participate performed their traditional study routine; no other changes
to assessments were made resulting in a Gameplay and non-gameplay (G,
NG) group for each year. Students were invited to participate in an
online focus group (N = 84) and a sample undertook in-depth interviews
(N = 9) to gain qualitative data on their perceptions of the
intervention. Students who participated in the gameplay (G) group (N =
87) demonstrated a significant improvement in A3 compared to A2, and the
non-game play (NG) group (N = 164) a significant decrease. A thematic
analysis was undertaken on the focus group and interview data revealing
key aspects of quiz-gameplay as a learning tool. This paper offers
insight into the potential benefit of encouraging m-learning gameplay as
part of revision or learning for anatomy students. This information
could help educators and study support facilitate efficient revision
methods as well as initiate further research into the use of anatomy
gameplay to enhance the student learning experience.
Practitioner Notes
What is already known about this topic
Repeated and formative quizzing can help memory or knowledge retention.
Gameplay can help student engagement, learning and flow depending on the
game in question.
What this paper adds
Using mobile app-based quiz-games prior to an anatomy assessment can
improve student achievement.
Students tend to play mobile app-based quiz-games whilst commuting on
public transport, in their free time at home and at university.
Elements of mobile app-based quiz-games students identified as important
are that they are interactive, allow competition, are visually
appealing, provide instant feedback, are user friendly and are
facilitated by the teacher.
Implications for practice
Educators should encourage mobile app-based quiz-games to increase
short-term learning or revision.
Educators should facilitate mobile learning quiz-game opportunities to
encourage learning outside of the classroom.
Educators wanting to integrate mobile app-based quiz-games in their

due to open data access and lesser prediction times. There is a
continuous effort to improve the prediction accuracy of these models
through introducing new methods. This study is focused on flash flood

that combine the three meta-classifiers (Real AdaBoost, Random Subspace,
and MultiBoosting) with J48 (a tree-based algorithm that can be used to
evaluate the behavior of the attribute vector for any defined number of
instances) were used in the Gorganroud River Basin of Iran to assess
flood susceptibility (FS). A total of 426 flood positions as dependent
variables and a total of 14 flood conditioning factors (FCFs) as
independent variables were used to model the FS. Several
threshold-dependent and independent statistical tests were applied to
verify the performance and predictive capability of these machine
learning models, such as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve of the success rate curve (SRC) and prediction rate curve (PRC),
efficiency (E), root-mean square-error (RMSE), and true skill statistics
(TSS). The valuation of the FCFs was done using AdaBoost, frequency
ratio (FR), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) models. In the flooding of
the study area, altitude, land use/land cover (LU/LC), distance to
stream, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), and rainfall
played important roles. The Random Subspace J48 (RSJ48) ensemble method
with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 (SRC), 0.951 (PRC), E of

article,"Predicting credit card delinquencies: An application of deep neural
networks","The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it develops a prediction
system to help the credit card issuer model the credit card delinquency
risk. Second, it seeks to explore the potential of deep learning (also
called a deep neural network), an emerging artificial intelligence
technology, in the credit risk domain. With real-life credit card data
linked to 711,397 credit card holders from a large bank in Brazil, this
study develops a deep neural network to evaluate the risk of credit card
delinquency based on the client's personal characteristics and the
spending behaviours. Compared with machine-learning algorithms of
logistic regression, naive Bayes, traditional artificial neural
networks, and decision trees, deep neural networks have a better overall
predictive performance with the highest F scores and area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve. The successful application of
deep learning implies that artificial intelligence has great potential
to support and automate credit risk assessment for financial

article,"Establishment of smart education system in modern universities: concept,
technologies and challenges","The revolutionary digital transformations of society have led to the
need for formulating a smart higher education system, adequate to modern
conditions and based on the integrated use of intelligent digital
solutions. The paper substantiates that the creations of such systems
requires the solution of a whole complex of technological,
institutional, organizational, economic and managerial issues. In
accordance with this, the main tasks for the digital transformation of
universities are studied, including: the formation of basic digital
competencies, the incorporation of the digital agenda in research, the
substantial modernization of bachelor's and master's programs, as well
as programs of additional professional education. The paper identifies
various levels of introducing ICT into everyday practice and creating
the so-called ``smart education{''} system from the perspective of a
process approach. The article reveals the possibilities of applying the
paradigm of knowledge engineering for the intellectualisation of the
higher education system. The article also shows how the methods,
approaches and methodologies of knowledge engineering (KE) can be used
for the development of intelligent learning systems and smart tutoring
systems (STSs). It is proved that the convergence of artificial
intelligence (AI), web science (WS) and data science (DS) allows for the
creation of a new generation of web intelligent systems for all
educational and training tasks. One of the main objectives of this study
is to determine and explore the benefits and advantages of such
computational paradigms to increase the effectiveness and enhance the
efficiency of smart tutoring systems. The key advantages and challenges
of the use of modern intelligent systems and technologies in
universities are identified, taking into account the characteristics of
specific ICTs.Decisions are determined at different levels of the
economic hierarchy, the adoption of which is essential for the

enhancing the security performance of future 5G networks, which promises
to fulfill the demands of increasing user traffic. Preventing
eavesdroppers from overhearing and stealing useful information in such
high traffic environments is as challenging as eliminating them from the
network. The goal of this survey is to present a comprehensive study of
the latest PLS works proposed to enhance the security performance in
different 5G technologies. The survey starts by first giving a detailed
introduction and overview of existing surveys that explicitly or
partially discuss PLS in 5G and its emerging technologies. Many
researchers have presented a number of PLS schemes, using either a
separate technology such as Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO),
Millimeter Wave (mmWave), Radio frequency (RF), Non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA), Visible light communication (VLC), etc., or a combination
of two or more technologies, for securing each field of future 5G
networks such as Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), Device-to-Device
(D2D), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Cognitive radio network (CRN), Unmanned
Aerial Network (UAV), etc. After summarizing the existing surveys, we
present a detailed overview on the PLS research works performed till now
in HetNets, with respect to its different underlaying technologies, as
well as in other emerging 5G technologies. Then, optimization ontology
is presented that discusses different security metrics used for
measuring PLS performance. Different from rest of the surveys, our
survey includes a comprehensive discussion regarding the proposed PLS
techniques based on artificial intelligence and machine learning
techniques, especially highlighting the works performed using
reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms, allowing us to
understand how artificial intelligence can help to achieve better PLS.

article,"Predicting Patient Demographics From Chest Radiographs With Deep
Learning","Background: Deep learning models are increasingly informing medical
decision making, for instance, in the detection of acute intracranial
hemorrhage and pulmonary embolism. However, many models are trained on
medical image databases that poorly represent the diversity of the
patients they serve. In turn, many artificial intelligence models may
not perform as well on assisting providers with important medical
decisions for underrepresented populations.Purpose: Assessment of the
ability of deep learning models to classify the self-reported gender,
age, self-reported ethnicity, and in-surance status of an individual
patient from a given chest radiograph.Methods: Models were trained and
tested with 55,174 radiographs in the MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR)
database. External validation data came from two separate databases, one
from CheXpert and another from a multihospital urban health care system
after institutional review board approval. Macro-averaged area under the
curve (AUC) values were used to evaluate performance of models. Code
used for this study is open-source and available at
https://github.com/ai-bias/cxr-bias, and pixelstopatients.com/models/
demographics.Results: Accuracy of models to predict gender was nearly
perfect, with 0.999 (95\% confidence interval: 0.99-0.99) AUC on
held-out test data and 0.994 (0.99-0.99) and 0.997 (0.99-0.99) on
external validation data. There was high accuracy to predict age and
ethnicity, ranging from 0.854 (0.80-0.91) to 0.911 (0.88-0.94) AUC, and
moderate accuracy to predict insurance status, with AUC ranging from
0.705 (0.60-0.81) on held-out test data to 0.675 (0.54-0.79) on external
validation data.Conclusions: Deep learning models can predict the age,
self-reported gender, self-reported ethnicity, and insurance status of a
patient from a chest radiograph. Visualization techniques are useful to
ensure deep learning models function as intended and to demonstrate
anatomical regions of interest. These models can be used to ensure that
training data are diverse, thereby ensuring artificial intelligence
models that work on diverse populations.","Adleberg, Jason and Wardeh, Amr and Doo, Florence X. and Marinelli,

compact panel of miRNA signatures as potential markers from 4,667

of miRNA signatures suggested that three miRNAs, hsa-let-7i-3p,
hsa-miR-362-3p, and hsa-miR-3651, contributed significantly toward stage
prediction across 8 cancers, and each of the 67 miRNAs of the panel was
a biomarker of stage prediction in more than one cancer. CancerSig may

Learning Techniques and Ordinary Kriging","Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used as an alternative to
conventional and geostatistical methods in digital mapping of soil
attributes. An advantage of ML algorithms is their flexibility to use
various layers of information as covariates. However, ML algorithms come
in many variations that can make their application by end users
difficult. To fill this gap, a Smart-Map plugin, which complements
Geographic Information System QGIS Version 3, was developed using modern
artificial intelligence (AI) tools. To generate interpolated maps,
Ordinary Kriging (OK) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm
were implemented. The SVM model can use vector and raster layers
available in QGIS as covariates at the time of interpolation. Covariates
in the SVM model were selected based on spatial correlation measured by
Moran's Index (I'Moran). To evaluate the performance of the Smart-Map
plugin, a case study was conducted with data of soil attributes
collected in an area of 75 ha, located in the central region of the
state of Goias, Brazil. Performance comparisons between OK and SVM were
performed for sampling grids with 38, 75, and 112 sampled points. R-2
and RMSE were used to evaluate the performance of the methods. SVM was
found superior to OK in the prediction of soil chemical attributes at
the three sample densities tested and was therefore recommended for
prediction of soil attributes. In this case study, soil attributes with
R-2 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.83 and RMSE ranging from 0.07 to 12.01

examination using chest radiography being one of the most important
screening methods. For the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease,
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction remains the gold
standard. Currently available lab tests may not be able to detect all
infected individuals; new screening methods are required. We propose a
Multi-Input Transfer Learning COVID-Net fuzzy convolutional neural

latter and the open-source efforts in this research area. Furthermore,
we use an explainability method to investigate several Convolutional

also to aid clinicians in improving screening. We show that using
transfer learning and pre-trained models, we can detect it with a high
degree of accuracy. Using X-ray images, we chose four neural networks to
predict its probability. Finally, in order to achieve better results, we
considered various methods to verify the techniques proposed here. As a

circular CFRP confined concrete columns. A new GEP model has been
developed based on a credible and extensive database of 828 data points
to date. Numerous analyses were carried out to evaluate and validate the
presented model by comparing them with those presented previously by
different researchers along with external validation comparison. In
comparison to other artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface
system (ANFIS), only GEP has the capability and robustness to provide
output in the form of a simple mathematical relationship that is easy to
use. The developed GEP model is also compared with linear and nonlinear
regression models to evaluate the performance. Afterwards, a detailed
parametric and sensitivity analysis confirms the generalized nature of
the newly established model. Sensitivity analysis results indicate the
performance of the model by evaluating the relative contribution of
explanatory variables involved in development. Moreover, the Taylor
diagram is also established to visualize how the proposed model
outperformed other existing models in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
being closer to the target. Lastly, the criteria of external validation
were also fulfilled by the GEP model much better than other conventional
models. These findings show that the presented model effectively
forecasts the confined strength of circular concrete columns
significantly better than the previously established conventional
regression-based models.","Ilyas, Israr and Zafar, Adeel and Afzal, Muhammad Talal and Javed,

missing values imputation, and XAI","Background: DNA methylation has a significant effect on gene expression
and can be associated with various diseases. Meta-analysis of available
DNA methylation datasets requires development of a specific workflow for
joint data processing.
Results: We propose a comprehensive approach of combined DNA methylation
datasets to classify controls and patients. The solution includes data
harmonization, construction of machine learning classification models,
dimensionality reduction of models, imputation of missing values, and
explanation of model predictions by explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithms. We show that harmonization can improve classification
accuracy by up to 20\% when preprocessing methods of the training and
test datasets are different. The best accuracy results were obtained
with tree ensembles, reaching above 95\% for Parkinson's disease.
Dimensionality reduction can substantially decrease the number of
features, without detriment to the classification accuracy. The best
imputation methods achieve almost the same classification accuracy for
data with missing values as for the original data. XAI approaches have
allowed us to explain model predictions from both populational and
individual perspectives.
Conclusions: We propose a methodologically valid and comprehensive
approach to the classification of healthy individuals and patients with
various diseases based onwhole-blood DNAmethylation data using
Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia as examples. The proposed
algorithm works better for the former pathology, characterized by a
complex set of symptoms. It allows to solve data harmonization problems
