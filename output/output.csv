inbook,Artificial Intelligence and Changes at MIT and DARPA,"Smarter Than Their Machines -- The Oral Histories of the Pioneers of Interactive Computing is based on oral histories archived at the Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota. Included are the oral histories of some key pioneers of the computer industry selected by John that led to interactive computing, such as Richard Bloch, Gene Amdahl, Herbert W. Robinson, Sam Wyly, J.C.R. Licklider, Ivan Sutherland, Larry Roberts, Robert Kahn, Marvin Minsky, Michael Dertouzos, and Joseph Traub, as well as his own. John has woven them together via introductions that is, in essence, a personal walk down the computer industry road. John had the unique advantage of having been part of, or witness to, much of the history contained in these oral histories beginning as a co-op student at Arthur D. Little, Inc., in the 1950's. Eventually, he would become a pioneer in his own right by creating the computer industry's first successful software products company (Cullinane Corporation). However, an added benefit of reading these oral histories is that they contain important messages for our leaders of today, at all levels, including that government, industry, and academia can accomplish great things when working together in an effective way. This is how the computer industry was created, which then led to the Internet, both totally unanticipated just 75 years ago.",No data,No data,No data,2018,No data

proceedings,EASEAI 2022: Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Education through Advanced Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence,"Welcome to the fourth edition of the International Workshop on Education through Advanced Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (EASEAI 2022) to be held virtually on November 18, 2022, as a post-conference workshop of ESEC/FSE 2022. The development and spread of digital technologies in an accelerated way has deeply affected not only everyday life, but also the educational system. The differences between generations of students are increasing and this presents more challenges for educators in terms of the act of teaching and learning. The EASEAI workshop addresses this challenge by looking at the research fields of software engineering, education, and artificial intelligence to explore how they can be combined. Specifically, this workshop brings together researchers, teachers, and practitioners using advanced software engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques in education. They discuss the current state of the art and practices to establish new future directions with the aim of favoring efficient learning that will develop students the necessary skills for whatever profession the future will bring.",No data,No data,No data,2022,No data

The general public, as well as specialized audiences, have to face an ever-increasing amount of knowledge anddevelop new abilities. The EASEAI workshop addresses that challenge by looking at software engineering, education, and artificial intelligence research fields to explore how they can be combined. Specifically, this workshop brings together researchers, teachers, and practitioners who use advanced software engineering tools and artificial intelligence techniques in the education field and through a transgenerational and transdisciplinary range of students to discuss the current state of the art and practices, and establish new future directions.",No data,No data,No data,2021,No data

incollection,"Blockchain for Business: Next-Generation Enterprise Artificial
Intelligence Systems","This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of
public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and
the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence
systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a
software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value
(e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the
Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or
government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are
trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be
trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas
private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains
are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers,
with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording
transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda,
Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics
and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial
intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together
with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is
its role in creating ``clean data{''}: validated, trustable,
interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop
across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes,
and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset
pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt
and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in
global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity
credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties),
and asset tokens (Primalbase).","Swan, Melanie",No data,10.1016/bs.adcom.2018.03.013,2018,42
incollection,Machine Learning for Sustainable Energy Systems,"In recent years, machine learning has proven to be a powerful tool for
deriving insights from data. In this review, we describe ways in which
machine learning has been leveraged to facilitate the development and
operation of sustainable energy systems. We first provide a taxonomy of
machine learning paradigms and techniques, along with a discussion of
their strengths and limitations. We then provide an overview of existing
research using machine learning for sustainable energy production,
delivery, and storage. Finally, we identify gaps in this literature,
propose future research directions, and discuss important considerations
for deployment.","Donti, Priya L. and Kolter, J. Zico","sustainable energy; energy transition; climate change; machine learning;
