inproceedings,Hackathons as a Pedagogical Strategy to Engage Students to Learn and to Adopt Software Engineering Practices,"Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.","Steglich, Caio and Salerno, Larissa and Fernandes, Tha\'{\i}s and Marczak, Sabrina and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana Paula and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio","Student Motivation, Case Study, Educational Hackathon, Software Engineering Education",10.1145/3422392.3422479,2020,10
inproceedings,Hack.Edu: Examining How College Hackathons Are Perceived By Student Attendees and Non-Attendees,"College hackathons have become popular in the past decade, with tens of thousands of students now participating each year across hundreds of campuses. Since hackathons are informal learning environments where students learn and practice coding without any faculty supervision, they are an important site for computing education researchers to study as a complement to studying formal classroom learning environments. However, despite their popularity, little is known about why students choose to attend these events, what they gain from attending, and conversely, why others choose *not* to attend. This paper presents a mixed methods study that examines student perceptions of college hackathons by focusing on three main questions: 1.) Why are students motivated to attend hackathons? 2.) What kind of learning environment do these events provide? 3.) What factors discourage students from attending? Through semi-structured interviews with six college hackathon attendees (50% female), direct observation at a hackathon, and 256 survey responses from college students (42% female), we discovered that students were motivated to attend for both social and technical reasons, that the format generated excitement and focus, and that learning occurred incidentally, opportunistically, and from peers. Those who chose not to attend or had negative experiences cited discouraging factors such as physical discomfort, lack of substance, an overly competitive climate, an unwelcoming culture, and fears of not having enough prior experience. We conclude by discussing ideas for making college hackathons more broadly inclusive and welcoming in light of our study's findings.","Warner, Jeremy and Guo, Philip J.","situated learning, college hackathon, informal learning",10.1145/3105726.3106174,2017,9
inproceedings,Hackathons as an Informal Learning Platform,"Hackathons are fast-paced events where competitors work in teams to go from an idea to working software or hardware within a single day or a weekend and demonstrate their creation to a live audience of peers. Due to the ""fun"" and informal nature of such events, they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum of students, especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In this paper, we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon events over the past two years, with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 student participants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events, we observed a significant amount of peer-learning -- students teaching each other how to solve specific challenges and learn new skills. The events featured mentors from both the university and industry, who provided round-the-clock hands-on support, troubleshooting and advice. Due to the gamified format of the events, students were heavily motivated to learn new skills due to practical applicability and peer effects, rather than merely academic metrics. Some teams continued their hacks as long-term projects, while others formed new student groups to host lectures and practice building prototypes on a regular basis. Using a combined analysis of post-event surveys, student academic records and source-code commit log data from the event, we share insights, demographics, statistics and anecdotes from hosting these hackathons.","Nandi, Arnab and Mandernach, Meris","hackathon, informal learning",10.1145/2839509.2844590,2016,6
article,Lucene4IR: Developing Information Retrieval Evaluation Resources Using Lucene,"The workshop and hackathon on developing Information Retrieval Evaluation Resources using Lucene (L4IR) was held on the 8th and 9th of September, 2016 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK and funded by the ESF Elias Network. The event featured three main elements: (i) a series of keynote and invited talks on industry, teaching and evaluation; (ii) planning, coding and hacking where a number of groups created modules and infrastructure to use Lucene to undertake TREC based evaluations; and (iii) a number of breakout groups discussing challenges, opportunities and problems in bridging the divide between academia and industry, and how we can use Lucene for teaching and learning Information Retrieval (IR). The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.","Azzopardi, Leif and Moshfeghi, Yashar and Halvey, Martin and Alkhawaldeh, Rami S. and Balog, Krisztian and Di Buccio, Emanuele and Ceccarelli, Diego and Fern\'{a}ndez-Luna, Juan M. and Hull, Charlie and Mannix, Jake and Palchowdhury, Sauparna",No data,10.1145/3053408.3053421,2017,18
inproceedings,Developing Course Projects in a Hack Day: An Experience Report,"Some researchers are starting to point out the importance of hackathons as an alternative venue for college students practicing and learning. Many positive aspects were highlighted such as peer learning and improvements in problem-solving, project management and task priority analysis. However, this hackathon phenomena is something that is happening outside the curriculum, with scarce reports of teachers taking advantage of similar approaches in undergraduate courses. In this article, we present our experience of an undergraduate introductory course on Distributed Systems where students have to participate in a ""hack day"" at the end of the semester. The goal is to take advantage of the hackathon model to bring a more realistic and engaging scenario where students can develop their course project and put into practice what they have learned in the semester. With this model, they have to do face-to-face group work and also have the opportunity to share knowledge with other groups. Our experience indicates positive results with this approach. Students reported a high level of engagement and enthusiasm. There were different situations of peer learning being reported, and according to their perception, students felt they learned more in the hack day than in lectures or laboratory practice.","Gama, Kiev","hackathon, peer learning, challenge-based learning, project-based learning",10.1145/3304221.3319777,2019,7
inproceedings,Post-Hackathon Learning Circles: Supporting Lean Startup Development,"Hackathons provide rapid, hands-on opportunities to explore innovative solutions to problems, but provide little support to teams in moving those solutions into practice. We explore the use of post-hackathon Learning Circles to connect hackathon teams with key stakeholders, to reflect on prototypes and consider business models. We conducted a qualitative field study with 4 post-hackathon teams on the theme of technology, social isolation, and aging. Our results show that Learning Circles are an effective way to involve stakeholders early in the development process, and to develop a deeper understanding of users, markets, and technology.","Chan, Tina and McMurray, Josephine and Levy, AnneMarie and Sveistrup, Heidi and Wallace, James","participatory design, aging, social isolation, hackathon",10.1145/3334480.3375216,2020,8
inproceedings,Understanding Female-Focused Hackathon Participants' Collaboration Styles and Event Goals,"Collegiate hackathons are informal learning environments where students build new projects in a limited amount of time and often compete for prizes. Previous hackathon research has shown that students go to these events to learn new technical skills, work on projects with friends, or network with the technical community; however, little is known about the different ways in which students collaborate with other participants and how students' event goals affect their trajectory at the hackathon. In the literature, students are typically described as working in competitive teams that build one project to be entered into a competition. However, there are gaps when it comes to discussing other ways students may work together or what other non-competitive projects/activities students may want to engage with at a hackathon. This paper reports on different collaboration styles and event goals documented at a Spring 2018 female-focused hackathon. Findings include three types of collaboration styles: team-based, cooperative group, and individual participation; as well as four types of event goals: competition, exploration, dabbling, and observing. These findings can inform the collegiate hackathon literature and help hackathons diversify their events by offering insight into ways diverse participants choose to participate at a hackathon and offering design suggestions that mainstream collegiate hackathons can adopt to be more inclusive of different types of students.","Kos, Brittany Ann","hackathon, informal learning, teamwork, women",10.1145/3316287.3316292,2019,4
article,You Hacked and Now What? - Exploring Outcomes of a Corporate Hackathon,"Time bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention from practitioners and researchers. Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.","Nolte, Alexander and Pe-Than, Ei Pa Pa and Filippova, Anna and Bird, Christian and Scallen, Steve and Herbsleb, James D.","hackathon, project sustainability, learning, innovation",10.1145/3274398,2018,23
inproceedings,The 2nd Workshop on Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events: Current Trends and Next Steps in Research and Event Design,"Hackathons or Hackathon-style events, describe increasingly popular time-bounded intensive events across different fields and sectors. Often cited examples of hackathons include the demanding overnight competitive coding events, but there are many design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims. They offer a new form of collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and engaging with new audiences. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events and socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.","Pe Than, Ei Pa Pa and Herbsleb, James and Nolte, Alexander and Gerber, Elizabeth and Fiore-Gartland, Brittany and Chapman, Brad and Moser, Aurelia and Wilkins-Diehr, Nancy","hackathons, radical collocation, time-bounded collaborative events, open-source software, edit-a-thons, codefests, scientific software, sprints, innovation, collaborative learning",10.1145/3170427.3170615,2018,8
inproceedings,The Community Garden Hack: Participatory Experiments in Facilitating Primary School Teacher's Appropriation of Technology,"1As technology increasingly pervades the daily life of teachers and students, finding sustainable ways to successfully integrate innovative technologies in classrooms remains a challenge. This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.","Karimi, Arafeh and Worthy, Peter and McInnes, Paul and Bod\'{e}n, Marie and Matthews, Ben and Viller, Stephen","computational thinking, professional development, participatory design, primary education, makerspace, hackathon",10.1145/3152771.3152787,2017,9
inproceedings,The Collegiate Hackathon Experience,"Collegiate hackathons are marathon-style, project building competitions where students can learn computing in an informal environment, build community, network with members of the technology industry, and be more productive members of the workforce. I am interested in understanding the social climate of hackathons and how it affects hackathon participants, particularly women and non-binary students, who only make up 23% of collegiate hackathon attendees. I will be exploring two lines of inquiry: (1) to explore the experiences of hackathon attendees to gain a deeper understanding about why participants do (or do not) participate in hackathons, what motivates them to attend, and what engages them at these events; and (2) to explore the ways collegiate hackathons can adapt their design practices to create an inclusive and equitable events for marginalized and minority students.","Kos, Brittany Ann","nonbinary, women, collegiate hackathon, gender, informal learning",10.1145/3230977.3231022,2018,2
inproceedings,Hackathons in the Formal Learning Process,"Hackathons are short-lived events, typically lasting from 1 to 3 days, where participants gather into groups to tackle a challenge and present a proof of concept in the form of software or hardware prototype, motivated by a common theme. Studies show that learning is one of the primary motivations for people joining hackathons, where situated and collaborative learning take place. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. By taking that into account, we considered bringing hackathons into the classroom. This paper presents a case study of an Internet of Things (IoT) undergraduate course where a hackathon is used as a learning instrument, leveraging on challenge-based learning to motivate students to find and develop a suitable semester project. We utilize a mixed-method approach where quantitative and qualitative data are used to analyze the perspective of students about the effectiveness of that approach.","Gama, Kiev and Alencar Gon\c{c}alves, Breno and Alessio, Pedro","Situated Learning, Challenge-based learning, IoT, Hackathon",10.1145/3197091.3197138,2018,6
inproceedings,Four Factors Informing Design Judgement at a Hackathon,"Hackathons have attracted increasing interest in recent years, and whereas much of the research focus on the role of hackathons as potential means for education, innovation, or municipal engagement, this paper focuses on the creative process of a hackathon. We present an explorative, autobiographical case study of a team at a hackathon and in the analysis we identify four factors, which in particular impacted the team's design judgement during the hackathon: 1) The hackathon format, 2) the available tools and materials, 3) the participants' domain knowledge, and 4) the participants' technical knowledge. Though the factors are evident in most design processes, we discuss how the four factors in a hackathon setting influenced the design judgement in a particular way and how the factors influenced the creative engagement in developing technology in the hackathon. We discuss potential implications for future research on how to understand design judgements made under the particular circumstances of a hackathon.","Olesen, Jeanette Falk and Hansen, Nicolai Brodersen and Halskov, Kim","tools and materials, creative process, design process, hackathon",10.1145/3292147.3292155,2018,11
article,The BGP Hackathon 2016 Report,"Internet routes - controlled by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - carry our communication and our commerce, yet many aspects of routing are opaque to even network operators, and BGP is known to contribute to performance, reliability, and security problems. The research and operations communities have developed a set of tools and data sources for understanding and experimenting with BGP, and on February 2016 we organized the first BGP Hackathon, themed around live measurement and monitoring of Internet routing. The Hackathon included students, researchers, operators, providers, policymakers, and funding agencies, working together on projects to measure, visualize, and improve routing or the tools we use to study routing. This report describes the tools used at the Hackathon and presents an overview of the projects. The Hackathon was a success, and we look forward to future iterations.","Dainotti, Alberto and Katz-Bassett, Ethan and Dimitropolous, Xenofontas","BGP, internet measurement, routing, hackathon",10.1145/3243157.3243169,2018,6
article,How to Support Newcomers in Scientific Hackathons - An Action Research Study on Expert Mentoring,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.","Nolte, Alexander and Hayden, Linda Bailey and Herbsleb, James D.","mentoring, hackathon, scientific communities, learning",10.1145/3392830,2020,23
inproceedings,"How to Hackathon: Socio-Technical Tradeoffs in Brief, Intensive Collocation","Hackathons are events where people who are not normally collocated converge for a few days to write code together. Hackathons, it seems, are everywhere. We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.","Trainer, Erik H. and Kalyanasundaram, Arun and Chaihirunkarn, Chalalai and Herbsleb, James D.","qualitative methods, multiple-case study, collocation, scientific software, Hackathons",10.1145/2818048.2819946,2016,13
inproceedings,Exploring Collaborative Storytelling as a Method for Creating Educational Games,"Designing educational games that meet both learning and entertainment objectives is a challenging task. Games that begin by developing specific educational goals and are later wrapped in a game or narrative context risk appearing forced, while those that begin with gaming elements to which educational elements are added may appear superficial. In this paper, we describe the methodology and results from a three-day interdisciplinary hackathon for developing game narratives designed to address both needs.

article,What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects? Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,"Time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.","Nolte, Alexander and Chounta, Irene-Angelica and Herbsleb, James D.","social computing, project sustainability, project continuation, hackathon",10.1145/3415216,2020,26

They are increasingly becoming an alternative and popular method for fast learning and networking, bringing people together in a short period to do creative projects. However, the number of women participating in such events is extremely low and worrying, and literature lacks empirical evidence about the reasons for that. This qualitative study gathers data and brings a discussion about this topic, as an attempt to understand better why women are not so interested in this type of event.

It was created as part of a rich set of instructional resources designed for teachers of the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Yet, App Lab far exceeds the needs of CSP, and would be an appropriate learning environment for students in any CS0/CS1 class, even at the university level. App Lab gives novice programmers access to capabilities previously reserved for courses that require sophisticated tech setup and knowledge of both front and backend web development, server-side scripting, databases, etc.Rather than focusing on curriculum, this workshop will focus on how App Lab works as a programming tool in its own right, and how it was designed to aid and motivate student learning. Participants will get hands-on time with some of App Lab's more advanced features guided by a Code.org product manager, while working with the education team to help understand the educational philosophy that went into its development. Participants will come away with exemplars that highlight App Lab's possibilities, practice with some of its richer features, and do a hackathon to create something to share with each other (and the world)! Finally, we will end with a discussion about how best to integrate App Lab into existing courses.App Lab was developed as part of collaboration between Code.org and David Bau (Google), creator of PencilCode.net.A laptop is required for this session.

article,Hosting Hackathons a Tool in Retaining Students with Beneficial Side Effects,"Research into factors related to retaining students in computing and technology programs has shown that the students sense of community and their personal sense of identity to be factors that matter. To proactively address these issues students and faculty of a Midwestern university came up with the idea of hosting their own hackathon in 2010. In general a hackathon event involves the collaborative development of software projects in a concentrated time period. Having hosted five hackathons we have developed a body of knowledge through experience, which we hope will encourage other schools to hold their own hackathons. This paper describes the issues related to retention in computing and technology programs, some of the factors and decisions that have to be made in hosting a hackathon, and some of the side benefits that hackathons produce.","Munro, David",No data,No data,2015,6

inproceedings,Datathons: An Experience Report of Data Hackathons for Data Science Education,Large amounts of data are becoming increasingly available through open data repositories as well as companies and governments collecting data to improve decision making and efficiencies. Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.,"Anslow, Craig and Brosz, John and Maurer, Frank and Boyes, Mike","analytics, community engagement, open data, data science, datathon, hackathon",10.1145/2839509.2844568,2016,6

inproceedings,Self Harmony: Rethinking Hackathons to Design and Critique Digital Technologies for Those Affected by Self-Harm,"In this paper we explore the opportunities, challenges and best practices around designing technologies for those affected by self-harm. Our work contributes to a growing HCI literature on mental health and wellbeing, as well as understandings of how to imbue appropriate value-sensitivity within the digital design process in these contexts. The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.","Birbeck, Nataly and Lawson, Shaun and Morrissey, Kellie and Rapley, Tim and Olivier, Patrick","self-harm, mental health and wellbeing, hackathons",10.1145/3025453.3025931,2017,12
inproceedings,StitchFest: Diversifying a College Hackathon to Broaden Participation and Perceptions in Computing,"While coding competitions and hackathons have steadily increased in number, few women participate. Because these public events present viable opportunities to broaden participation in computing, we designed the theme to focus on ""Wear &amp; Care"" and collaborative arrangements in a hardware hackathon, called StitchFest, in which 33 undergraduate and graduate students used the LilyPad Arduino to design wearables. Our analysis focused on the interviews conducted with eight female and seven male college participants to understand how targeted recruitment, thematic framing, space arrangements, kinds of materials and material distribution impacted participation and perception. We discuss what we learned about setting a thematic focus and fostering collaborative learning in coding competitions for broadening participation in computing.","Richard, Gabriela T. and Kafai, Yasmin B. and Adleberg, Barrie and Telhan, Orkan","wearable computing, gender, broadening participation, hackathons, coding competitions",10.1145/2676723.2677310,2015,6
inproceedings,"Collaborative Research into Game Jams, Hackathons and Event-Based Teaching in Higher Education (Abstract Only)","The idea for this session is based on conversations with colleagues from computer science, art, communications, engineering, and biology as well as international colleagues from three continents at ITICSE-2016 on the use of Game Jams to increase participation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Computer Science and STEM education. High-impact practices are powerful tools in engaging students (NSSE, 2014), perhaps even more so for non-traditional, ESL/ELL, first-generation, and URM students in STEM disciplines by increasing peer and faculty contact, active learning, and high expectations (Goodman). We believe that event-based teaching, such as Game jams and Hackathons provide students with many, if not more of the experiences that are credited with those of commonly identified High Impact Practices (Kuh, 2008).These events also create peer and social networks among participants. While not conclusive - anecdotally the networks of peers and social capacity seem to make a difference in post graduation job search (Mouw). Game Jams and Hackathons are still relatively new in higher education, and while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence as to the benefits reaped by participants of these events, there exists little in the way of long-term studies in the literature that speaks to the academic value of these events.This session will create a conversation among faculty from computer science and other disciplines who are interested in creating these events and their institutions, and developing scholarship to fill in the gaps in the literature around the effects and efficacy of these events on the long-term success of participants.","Pollock, Ian and Brooks, Lonny","stem, collaborative research, hackathons, transdisciplinary practices, high impact practices, event-based teaching, steam, game jams",10.1145/3017680.3022367,2017,1
article,"""The Personal is Political"": Hackathons as Feminist Consciousness Raising","Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in Feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of ""feminist consciousness raising"" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just ""awareness-raising"", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.","D'Ignazio, Catherine and Michelson, Rebecca and Hope, Alexis and Hoy, Josephine and Roberts, Jennifer and Krontiris, Kate","feminism, hackathons, feminist hci, race, health, gender",10.1145/3415221,2020,23

inproceedings,Touched by the Hackathon: A Study on the Connection between Hackathon Participants and Start-up Founders,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons, code fests and others have become a global phenomenon. Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.","Nolte, Alexander","Start-up, Hackathon, Entrepreneurship",10.1145/3340481.3342735,2019,6
inproceedings,Game Making as a Learning Strategy for Chemical Engineering,"This document introduces the learning approach and projected outcomes of the author's ongoing PhD research, which aims to deliver guidelines for the use of game-based learning techniques, with game making at its core, in chemical engineering education. Since making games requires some technical knowledge that chemical engineering students do not usually possess, the author is developing a custom-made editor to make games intuitively without needing programming skills. Additionally, a game design workshop is included in the learning experience to ease the difficulties of beginners when creating games. All in all, the strategy facilitates hands on sessions that extend traditional education, during which chemical engineering content is approached differently than in a conventional class. Students work in teams, embrace a constructivist learning approach to create an educational game and participate in a hackathon-like event (game jam) to mention some of the features included in this learning experience.","Forn\'{o}s, S\'{\i}lvia","game editor, platform game, chemical engineering, game-based learning, game jams, constructivist education, making games",10.1145/3383668.3419888,2020,3
inproceedings,Curated Pathways to Innovation: Personalized CS Education to Promote Diversity,"The lack of diversity in computing is a well-known issue. This poster is a work-in-progress report on Curated Pathways to Innovation (CPI), a web-based tool which gathers existing online resources for computer science (CS) engagement and learning to allow students to learn more about CS careers and content, with a particular focus on improving participation of K-12 girls and under-represented minorities in CS. This project is a collaboration of people from academia in CS and social science, K-12 education, non-profit, and industry. We are about halfway through a 3-year pilot deployment of CPI with all students in a low-income, primarily Latino/a middle school with nearly 500 students, and smaller deployments have been undertaken and are planned for 2018-19. In addition to online content, we have created in-person experiences, including reverse science fairs, summer camps, and a hackathon, which are tracked in the CPI tool. To measure impact, we conduct regular surveys with the students measuring their interest in CS, self-efficacy, and other metrics. Our evaluation of the system based on survey data has helped inform the development of the system and curriculum, but remains preliminary. This poster also discusses the tool itself. It uses gamification in the form of badges to measure student progress. From the beginning, the vision was to use machine learning to customize recommendations based on students' demographics, background, and past performance. This integration is coming to fruition at the same time we are including more interesting visuals in the UI, such as an avatar and animations.","Linnell, Natalie and Gonsalves, Phil and Kakodkar, Mayank and Martinez, Vanessa and Urdan, Tim and Ribiero, Bruno and Zdankus, Janice","diversity, machine learning, tools",10.1145/3287324.3293845,2019,1
inproceedings,Mapathons and Hackathons to Crowdsource the Generation and Usage of Geographic Data,"Mapathons and hackathons are short-lived events with different purposes. A mapathon is a collaborative effort for collecting geographic data in unmapped areas, while hackathons are focused on application development. Mapathon outputs need to be high quality to be reusable, but often, when applications are later built on top of map data, there is a mismatch between data collected and application requirements. We conducted an international collaboration project aiming to address this situation by creating a circular process where geographic information is collected in a mapathon and later used in a hackathon. Based on user feedback this cycle can be repeated so the collected data and developed applications can be improved. In this event report, we describe the two mapathon-hackathon cycles that were part of our pilot to validate that process. We present their outcomes and some lessons learned. We focused on the so-called ""blue economy"" (i.e. the sustainable use of marine and ocean resources for economic growth and improved livelihoods in coastal areas.) as the target domain for this pilot. Data for carefully selected areas of the South African coast was collected through in mapathons and later use in hackathons. The mapathons were held in South Africa, and the hackathons took place in Brazil.","Gama, Kiev and Rautenbach, Victoria and Green, Cameron and Gon\c{c}alves, Breno Alencar and Coetzee, Serena and Fourie, Nicolene and Sastry, Nishanth","Mapathon, Volunteer Geographic Information, Hackathon",10.1145/3316287.3316293,2019,5

inproceedings,10 Years of Research With and On Hackathons,"Hackathon formats have been praised for their potential for promoting innovative thinking and making in a short time-frame. For this reason, hackathons have also been embraced by many researchers who use hackathons as part of their research in various ways. Through an extensive review of 381 publications published during a 10 year time span, we document the multiple ways in which hackathons are embraced and used by researchers The paper contributes to a better understanding of hackathons as part of research by providing a broad overview as a resource for researchers. We identify three main motivations for using hackathons as part of research: 1) Structuring learning, 2) structuring processes, and 3) enabling participation. For each of the motivations, we identify research with hackathons, and research on hackathons as two main categories. Drawing on several examples from the review we discuss benefits and challenges of using hackathons as part of research.","Falk Olesen, Jeanette and Halskov, Kim","hackathons, research method, literature review",10.1145/3357236.3395543,2020,16
inproceedings,"Experience Report: Thinkathon -- Countering an ""I Got It Working"" Mentality with Pencil-and-Paper Exercises","Goal-directed problem-solving labs can lead a student to believe that the most important achievement in a first programming course is to get programs working. This is counter to research indicating that code comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers. We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and furthermore, that students weren't making the connection between code comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200 pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.","Cutts, Quintin and Barr, Matthew and Bikanga Ada, Mireilla and Donaldson, Peter and Draper, Steve and Parkinson, Jack and Singer, Jeremy and Sundin, Lovisa","introductory programming, mastery learning, program comprehension, goal-directed problem solving",10.1145/3304221.3319785,2019,7

inproceedings,Short Datathon for the Interdisciplinary Development of Data Analysis and Visualization Skills,"Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests, Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper, we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University of Technology - Paran\'{a}. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.","Salinas, Myrian Noguera and Emer, Maria Claudia Figueiredo Pereira and Neto, Adolfo Gustavo Serra Seca","data analysis, data visualization, international fraud, datathon",10.1109/CHASE.2019.00031,2019,4

inproceedings,ShareInsights: An Unified Approach to Full-Stack Data Processing,"The field of data analysis seeks to extract value from data for either business or scientific benefit. This field has seen a renewed interest with the advent of big data technologies and a new organizational role called data scientist. Even with the new found focus, the task of analyzing large amounts of data is still challenging and time-consuming.The essence of data analysis involves setting up data pipe-lines which consists of several operations that are chained together - starting from data collection, data quality checks, data integration, data analysis and data visualization (including the setting up of interaction paths in that visualization).In our opinion, the challenges stem from from the technology diversity at each stage of the data pipeline as well as the lack of process around the analysis.In this paper we present a platform that aims to significantly reduce the time it takes to build data pipelines. The platform attempts to achieve this in following ways. Allow the user to describe the entire data pipeline with a single language and idioms - all the way from data ingestion to insight expression (via visualization and end-user interaction).Provide a rich library of parts that allow users to quickly assemble a data analysis pipeline in the language.Allow for a collaboration model that allows multiple users to work together on a data analysis pipeline as well as leverage and extend prior work with minimal effort.We studied the efficacy of the platform for a data hackathon competition conducted in our organization. The hackathon provided us with a way to study the impact of the approach. Rich data pipelines which traditionally took weeks to build were constructed and deployed in hours. Consequently, we believe that the complexity of designing and running the data analysis pipeline can be significantly reduced; leading to a marked improvement in the productivity of data analysts/data scientists.","Deshpande, Mukund and Ray, Dhruva and Dixit, Sameer and Agasti, Avadhoot","data visualization, data pipeline, big data, data analysis",10.1145/2723372.2742800,2015,16

Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops.

inproceedings,Data Programming with DDLite: Putting Humans in a Different Part of the Loop,"Populating large-scale structured databases from unstructured sources is a critical and challenging task in data analytics. As automated feature engineering methods grow increasingly prevalent, constructing sufficiently large labeled training sets has become the primary hurdle in building machine learning information extraction systems. In light of this, we have taken a new approach called data programming [7]. Rather than hand-labeling data, in the data programming paradigm, users generate large amounts of noisy training labels by programmatically encoding domain heuristics as simple rules. Using this approach over more traditional distant supervision methods and fully supervised approaches using labeled data, we have been able to construct knowledge base systems more rapidly and with higher quality. Since the ability to quickly prototype, evaluate, and debug these rules is a key component of this paradigm, we introduce DDLite, an interactive development framework for data programming. This paper reports feedback collected from DDLite users across a diverse set of entity extraction tasks. We share observations from several DDLite hackathons in which 10 biomedical researchers prototyped information extraction pipelines for chemicals, diseases, and anatomical named entities. Initial results were promising, with the disease tagging team obtaining an F1 score within 10 points of the state-of-the-art in only a single day-long hackathon's work. Our key insights concern the challenges of writing diverse rule sets for generating labels, and exploring training data. These findings motivate several areas of active data programming research.","Ehrenberg, Henry R. and Shin, Jaeho and Ratner, Alexander J. and Fries, Jason A. and R\'{e}, Christopher",No data,10.1145/2939502.2939515,2016,6
inproceedings,Songle Sync: A Large-Scale Web-Based Platform for Controlling Various Devices in Synchronization with Music,"This paper presents Songle Sync, a web-based platform on which hundreds of Internet-connected devices - including smartphones, computers, and other physical computing devices - can be controlled to synchronize with music playback. It uses music-understanding technologies to dynamically synthesize music-driven multimedia performances from a musical piece of choice. To simultaneously control hundreds of devices, a conventional architecture keeps always-on connections between them. However, it does not scale and suffers from latency and jitter issues when there are various devices with potentially unstable networks. We address this with a novel autonomous control architecture in which each device is notified of forthcoming musical events (e.g., beats and chorus sections) to automatically drive various changes in multimedia performances. Moreover, we provide a development kit of an event-driven multimedia framework for JavaScript, example programs, and an interactive tutorial. To evaluate the platform, we compared latencies, jitters, and amounts of network traffic between ours and the conventional architecture. To examine use cases in the wild, we deployed the platform to drive over a hundred of a variety of devices. We also developed a web browser-based application for a multimedia performance with music playback. It provided audiences of hundreds with a bring-your-own-device experience of synchronized animations on smartphones. In addition, the development kit was used in a two-day hackathon. We report lessons learned from these studies and discuss the future of the Internet of Musical Things.","Kato, Jun and Ogata, Masa and Inoue, Takahiro and Goto, Masataka","application programming interface, internet of musical things, multimedia control, music synchronization",10.1145/3240508.3240619,2018,9
inproceedings,Global Gov Jam: Motivational Aspects of Participants,"Open innovation initiatives aimed at building and proposing service improvements for the Government increasingly include activities of programming marathons for Apps (hackathons), ideation and prototype challenges as different ways to stimulate civic engagement. In this scenario is the Global Gov Jam, a 48-hour event that happens simultaneously in several cities around the world, aiming to involve government people together with citizens to propose innovative ideas for solving governmental problems. This work investigates what are the main motivational aspects of factors that lead people to engage in Global Gov Jam and what are the correlations among those factors. The method used was the replication of a survey applied previously to participants of civic hackathon events, with some adaptations motivated by the characteristics of the type of event we studied. The results show that ""thinking outside the box"", which gives the possibility of producing innovation without the conventional limitations, is the most significant motivational aspect for participating in this event. Evidence points to the similarity of the main motivational factors, among the results found in the original research on hackathons and this work. We also demonstrate through empirical evidence that there is correlation among motivational factors related to social interactions, such as visibility among peers, performing teamwork, and networking.","Alencar, Breno and Gama, Kiev","Global Gov Jam, Service Design, Prototyping",10.1145/3196697.3196701,2018,8
inproceedings,An Image Segment-Based Classification for Chest X-Ray Image,"In late 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has been rapidly growing since then. Molecular and antigen testing methods are very accurate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply. Because the virus affects an infected patient’s lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis. However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited. Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required. We describe a system for automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images. It first segmented images to select only the lung. The segmented part was then fed into a multiclass classification module, which worked well with samples obtained from various sources, which had different aspect ratios, contrast and viewpoints. The system also handled the unbalanced dataset—only a small fraction of images showed COVID-19. Our system achieved 92% of F1-score and 88.1% Marco F1-score on the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School Hackathon Phase 3—Multi-class COVID-19 Chest X-ray challenge public leaderboard.","Kittiworapanya, Phongsathorn and Pasupa, Kitsuchart","Imbalanced Data, Coronavirus, Computer Vision, COVID-19, Neural Networks",10.1145/3429210.3429227,2020,7

In 6-7 parallel sessions, our program includes presentations of 171 full research papers, 119 short research papers, and 30 demonstrations of new research advances. The program's focus this year can be seen at a glance in the word cloud at right, constructed from the titles of all accepted research papers. Also on offer are eight tutorials on timely research topics, and six collocated workshops on topics ranging from history to transportation, biomedicine to bias.We are excited about our greatly expanded data analytics competition this year, the CIKM AnalytiCup. During the past nine months, over 1500 teams from all over the world have vied to win over $60,000 in AnalytiCup prizes and travel money by solving real-world analytics problems posed by our corporate sponsors Alibaba/Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau, DataSpark, and Lazada. A fourth competition, a weekend-long hackathon sponsored by DHL, takes place immediately before the conference. The finalists from all four competitions come together on 6 November for a final showdown in front of corporate judges. Solution summaries from finalist teams in the first three competitions can be found in these proceedings. Also new this year are several other events aimed directly at practitioners. During the main conference, we are offering hands-on tutorials on the hot topics of scalable deep learning and scalable data science. The Case Studies track, intended to highlight the experiences and lessons learned by early adopters, debuts this year with 23 studies of technology adoption in interesting applications. And immediately before the main conference, CIKMconnect brings together students and industry for posters, technical discussions, recruiting events, and networking. It takes a village to produce a major conference! Our program committee chairs, senior PC and PC members valiantly and gracefully handled a record total number of submissions: 855 full research papers, 419 short research papers, 80 demos, and 103 case studies. Each submission was reviewed by three program committee members, each a recognized expert in the field, and an independent committee selected the full paper awards recipients.",No data,No data,No data,2017,No data
inproceedings,CodeTimeline: Storytelling with Versioning Data,"Working with a software system typically requires knowledge of the system's history, however this knowledge is often only tribal memory of the development team. In past user studies we have observed that when being presented with collaboration views and word clouds from the system's history engineers start sharing memories linked to those visualizations. In this paper we propose an approach based on a story-telling visualization, which is designed to entice engineers to share and document their tribal memory. Sticky notes can be used to share memories of a system's lifetime events, such as past design rationales but also more casual memories like pictures from after-work beer or a hackathon. We present an early-stage prototype implementation and include two design studies created using that prototype.","Kuhn, Adrian and Stocker, Mirko",No data,No data,2012,4

Therefore, we demonstrate the prototyping capabilities of ""User Studies Made Easy"" -- a software framework for multi-tool user studies. To do so, we showcase a simple dashboard HMI, which uses live data from a driving simulation and physiological assessment tools, with an emphasis on how little effort was needed to implement it. Additionally offering the opportunity to participate in a hackathon competition for a trust calibrating dashboard further fosters discussion about possible improvements to USE, as well as the topic of trust and acceptance in automation.","Schartm\""{u}ller, Clemens and Wintersberger, Philipp and Riener, Andreas","Software prototyping, Interactive Demo, User Studies",10.1145/3131726.3132046,2017,3
inproceedings,An Empirical Study of the Characteristics of Popular Game Jams and Their High-Ranking Submissions on Itch.Io,"Game jams are hackathon-like events that allow participants to develop a playable game prototype within a time limit. They foster creativity and the exchange of ideas by letting developers with different skill sets collaborate. Having a high-ranking game is a great bonus to a beginning game developer’s r\'{e}sum\'{e} and their pursuit of a career in the game industry. However, participants often face time constraints set by jam hosts while balancing what aspects of their games should be emphasized to have the highest chance of winning. Similarly, hosts need to understand what to emphasize when organizing online jams so that their jams are more popular, in terms of submission rate. In this paper, we study 1,290 past game jams and their 3,752 submissions on itch.io to understand better what makes popular jams and high-ranking games perceived well by the audience. We find that a quality description has a positive contribution to both a jam’s popularity and a game’s ranking. Additionally, more manpower organizing a jam or developing a game increases a jam’s popularity and a game’s high-ranking likelihood. High-ranking games tend to support Windows or macOS, and belong to the “Puzzle”, “Platformer”, “Interactive Fiction”, or “Action” genres. Also, shorter competitive jams tend to be more popular. Based on our findings, we suggest jam hosts and participants improve the description of their products and consider co-organizing or co-participating in a jam. Furthermore, jam participants should develop multi-platform multi-genre games. Finally, jam hosts should introduce a tighter time limit to increase their jam’s popularity.","Vu, Quang N. and Bezemer, Cor-Paul","mining software repositories, game jams, itch.io, empirical software engineering, game development",10.1145/3402942.3402981,2020,11
inproceedings,MUDAMOS: A Civil Society Initiative on Collaborative Lawmaking in Brazil,"Brazil's Constitution instituted a few means of direct democracy including the possibility of any citizen to propose a draft bill at a legislative house at the municipal, state or federal level, given the support of a minimum of citizens explicit through their signature. Until today, popular initiative bills' signatures are paper-based, which is not only costly, but also presents problems connected to transparency and safety principles. The Institute for Technology and Society of Rio believed that technology could transform this process and, hence, developed a mobile app called ""Mudamos"" (""we change"" in Portuguese) to prove that it is possible to sign bills of popular initiative electronically. Since the launch of the app Mudamos in March 2017, we have observed that the population has a lot of will to participate and good ideas to propose. However, despite this potential for engagement, citizens experience difficulty when transforming those ideas into draft bills to be presented to legislative houses. Therefore, we have developed ""Virada Legislativa"" (legal hackathon): a methodology comprising an activity to develop draft bills collectively addressing a single issue and within a timeframe. In this article, we aim to showcase this toolbox for democratic participation, connecting cutting-edge digital innovations on electronic signatures (online) with social innovative methodologies (offline), highlighting the impact we have had throughout this period as well as the challenges faced, and lessons learned.","Konopacki, Marco and Albu, Debora and Steibel, Fabro","Civic Technology, Cryptography, Deliberative Democracy, CrowdLaw, Participatory Democracy, Crowdsourcing",10.1145/3326365.3326388,2019,6
inproceedings,A Preliminary Study about the Low Engagement of Female Participation in Hackathons,"Hackathons, which are collaborative time-bounded events that are a sort of application development marathon, lasting between 24 and 48 hours, are increasing as an alternative and popular method for fast learning and networking, bringing people together in a short space of time to do creative projects. However, the number of women participating in such events is extremely low and worrying, and literature lacks empirical evidence about that.

article,Makers and Quilters: Investigating Opportunities for Improving Gender-Imbalanced Maker Groups,"Recent efforts to diversify participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) activities through informal learning environments, such as hackathons and makerspaces, confirm a real desire for inclusion among potential female participants. However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space.","MacArthur, Cayley and Wong, Caroline and Hancock, Mark","makerspaces, craft, making, quilting, game jams, feminism, game development, thematic analysis, gender",10.1145/3359131,2019,24
inproceedings,Living-Learning Community for Women in Computer Science at Rutgers,"We describe our experience developing and running a Computer Science Living-Learning Community (LLC) for first-year women at Rutgers University, now in its third year. Each year, around 20 first-year undergraduate women who intend to major in computer science (CS) apply and are selected to participate. LLC participants live in a common residence hall and are provided with an educational, mentoring, and community-building program that supports their progress as students and CS majors. Participants take a ""house course,"" Great Ideas and Insights in Computer Science, as a group, and also take a course on Knowledge and Power: Issues in Women's Leadership. Program activities include study sessions and industry interactions, as well as opportunities to participate in K-12 outreach programs, hackathons, and computing research. To evaluate the program, participants and a similar comparison group are surveyed at the beginning and end of the academic year and a focus group is conducted with program participants. Program participants find the program valuable and would recommend it to others, but both program participants and the comparison group report some lack of confidence in their potential success as computer scientists.","Wright, Rebecca N. and Nadler, Sally J. and Nguyen, Thu D. and Sanchez Gomez, Cynthia N. and Wright, Heather M.","living-learning communities, gender and diversity, undergraduate education",10.1145/3287324.3287449,2019,7
inproceedings,Everybody's Hacking: Participation and the Mainstreaming of Hackathons,"Hackathons have become a popular tool for bringing people together to imagine new possibilities for technology. Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.","Taylor, Nick and Clarke, Loraine","innovation, participatory design, jams, co-design, hackathons, making",10.1145/3173574.3173746,2018,12
article,Curated Pathways to Innovation: Personalized CS Education to Promote Diversity,"Curated Pathways to Innovation (CPI™) is a web tool that gathers existing online resources for computer science (CS) engagement and learning, exposing students to CS careers and content, especially targeting K-12 girls and under-represented minorities. CPI uses a machine learning recommender to customize content, and is a collaboration of academics in CS and social science, K - 12 educators, non-profit, and industry. We have deployed this tool in a low-income, primarily Latino/a middle school with nearly 500 students for over two years, in addition to lower-touch deployments at three high schools. We have also created in-person experiences for the students, such as reverse science fairs and hackathons, also tracked in CPI.

proceedings,ITiCSE '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education,"Benvenuti a Bologna---welcome to ITiCSE 2017 in BolognaThe Universit\'{a} di Bologna was founded in 1088 and is the oldest university in continuous operation worldwide. Bologna itself has a rich history going back at least 3,000 years, and among other things boasts a well-preserved historical town center, many porticoes and towers. The city is ranked at the top on the list of Italian cities in terms of quality of life and quality of food.The conference continues to be a truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554 authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and South America (50). In total, a total of 175 papers, one panel, and 16 working groups were submitted. Additionally, there were 31 posters and 18 tips &amp; techniques submissions.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least six reviewers. This year, 56 papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. All posters and tips &amp; techniques submissions were also reviewed by two reviewers. 24 posters and nine Tips and Techniques submissions were accepted.The nine accepted working groups will address a diverse section of topics, including student engagement, game development, integrating international students, assessment development, code quality perceptions, a holistic understanding through research papers, effects of lecturer intervention on student behaviour, the Internet of Things and early developmental activities leading to computational thinking skills. Participating in a working group is probably one of the most efficient ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. It provides participants a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group.This conference will have two keynote speakers. Stefano Zacchiroli from the University of Paris, Diderot will present the Software Heritage project; its goals, challenges, and potential scholarly and educational uses. Sana Odeh will discuss her work in broadening participation in computer science in the Arab world. In particular, Dr. Odeh will present the achievements of her annual Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab world.In addition to the tradition conference banquet, which will be held at a traditional Italian trattoria, conference delegates will have the opportunity to explore Bologna's sights, smells, and tastes.We hope you will be intellectually challenged, gastronomically sated, and culturally fulfilled.

inproceedings,Community Code Engagements: Summer of Code &amp; Hackathons for Community Building in Scientific Software,"Community code engagements -- short-term, intensive software development events -- are used by some scientific communities to create new software features and promote community building. But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceived by the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.","Trainer, Erik H. and Chaihirunkarn, Chalalai and Kalyanasundaram, Arun and Herbsleb, James D.","scientific software, google summer of code (gsoc), hackathons, community code engagements",10.1145/2660398.2660420,2014,11
inproceedings,Reappropriating Hackathons: The Production Work of the CHI4Good Day of Service,"The popularity of hackathons has increased as technology pervades more facets of our lives. Originally designed for programmers, hackathons are now being appropriated by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons, we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these events. We conducted an interview study with 22 stakeholders - participants, representatives of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop. We conclude by reflecting on implications for the CHI community in carrying out philanthropic events styled after hackathons.","Porter, Emily and Bopp, Chris and Gerber, Elizabeth and Voida, Amy","material production, social-issue, social networks, design process, civic, hackathon",10.1145/3025453.3025637,2017,5
inproceedings,Going Beyond The Challenge! Investigating The Aspects That Attract People to Participate in Hackathons,"Hackathons are events where their participants face the challenge of working intensively and collaboratively with other people. In these events, the participants have the opportunity to develop functional prototypes and solutions to real problems in a short time period (one to three days). Those kind of events have become increasingly popular and spread to several fields of knowledge. Also, they have been adopted by many organizations over the world. However, there is little scientific data that explains why people have participated in hackathons. In this paper, we report findings from an exploratory study in two hackathons organized by a big IT company. We aim to understand why their participants have voluntarily participated in such events. We identified four sets of motivational factors: technical, social, individual and business motivations. Technical motivations are associated with skill acquisition, while social motivations are related to the interaction between people during the event. Also, individual motivations are associated with a sense of autonomy and enjoyment of work. Finally, business motivations include the opportunity of publicizing work and the possibility of establishing partnerships. Our findings contributes to a broader understanding of the motivations for participating in hackathons, as well as providing recommendations for the organization of such events.","de Almeida Melo, Leandro and da Silva Junior, F\'{a}bio Freire and Leite, Tiago Henrique da S. and Filho, Fernando Figueira and de Souza, Cleidson R.

inproceedings,Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events: Current Trends and Next Steps in Research and Event Design,"Time-bounded collaborative events in which teams work together under intense time pressure are becoming increasingly popular. While hackathons, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims, such as sprints, codefests, hack-days, edit-a-thons and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.","Filippova, Anna and Chapman, Brad and Geiger, R.

inproceedings,ProtoTeams: Supporting Small Group Interactions in Co-Located Crowds,"Group facilitators often organize large co-located crowds into small groups where people can more effectively interact and learn from each other. However, current approaches for facilitating small group interactions typically do not capture data about the rapport and future potential of interacting groups. We introduce ProtoTeams, a system designed to facilitate and gather data from small group interactions by dynamically connecting people from larger co-located crowds, such as classrooms and hackathons, through personal mobile devices. The system randomly assigns subjects into groups, then guides them through short activities, at the end of which they evaluate their teammate preferences. We report preliminary results from three deployments in a university-level design studio course where students (N = 50) interact with peers on activities before forming teams for a quarter-long project. Results suggest that the system is intuitive and groups form efficiently. Few subjects report the environment being too hectic and activities too short to accurately evaluate their peers. Future studies will continue investigating the value of this tool in co-located team dynamics.","Umbelino, Gustavo and Ta, Vivian and Blake, Samuel and Truong, Eric and Luo, Amy and Dow, Steven","speed-dating, teammate selection, team formation systems, co-located collaboration",10.1145/3311957.3359505,2019,6
inproceedings,An Experience Report on the Adoption of Microservices in Three Brazilian Government Institutions,"Although monolithic applications are still the modus operandi of many software systems, the microservices architecture, which favors small and independent applications, is gaining increasing popularity. This is part due to its claimed benefits, which includes better scalability, productivity, and maintainability. However, little is known about how developers and architects perceive the benefits of migrating from monolithic applications to microservices, and what are the challenges towards achieving them. In this paper we discuss the motivation, benefits, and challenges related to the migration from monolithic enterprise architectures to a microservices based architecture. We report several lessons learned that arose from a two years process faced by three Brazilian Government Institutions. We also cross-validate these findings with a survey conducted with 13 practitioners in the studied companies. The results of our investigation highlight some evidence that the adoption of microservices brought several benefits for these institutions, such as (a) reducing development time and risks related to deployment activities and (b) increasing the opportunities to experiment with different technologies and development models (such as hackathons). However, our observations reveal that the adoption of microservices is still a challenging task, mainly because it not only demands the understanding of new techniques and tools, but it also increases the need to automate tasks related to software deployment and software monitoring. This study is particularly relevant for institutions interested in adopting a software architecture based on microservices, and we are currently sharing our experiences with other institutions.","Luz, Welder and Agilar, Everton and de Oliveira, Marcos C\'{e}sar and de Melo, Carlos Eduardo R. and Pinto, Gustavo and Bonif\'{a}cio, Rodrigo","monolithic applications, microservice applications, experience report, lessons learned",10.1145/3266237.3266262,2018,10

Over three events, makers and community members worked together to learn about the local area, design novel ideas that addressed local issues and build prototypes.

inproceedings,"Software Engineering for 'Social Good': Integrating Action Research, Participatory Design, and Agile Development","Software engineering for ‘social good’ is an area receiving growing interest in recent years. Software is increasingly seen as a way to promote positive social change: this includes initiatives such as Code for America and events such as hackathons, which strive to build innovative software solutions with a social conscience. From a software engineering perspective, existing software processes do not always match the needs of these social software projects, which are primarily aimed at social change and often involve vulnerable communities. In this paper, we argue for new software processes that combine elements of agile, iterative development with principles drawn from action research and participatory design. The former allow social software projects to be built quickly with limited resources; the latter allow for a proper understanding of the social context and vulnerable user groups. The paper describes Speedplay, a software development management framework integrating these approaches, and illustrates its use in a real social innovation case study.","Ferrario, Maria Angela and Simm, Will and Newman, Peter and Forshaw, Stephen and Whittle, Jon","socially conscious software, agile methods, action research",10.1145/2591062.2591121,2014,4
inproceedings,Understanding CS Undergraduate Students' Professional Identity through the Lens of Their Professional Development,"Academic institutions play a crucial role in the development of students' professional identities. However, we have limited knowledge of how computing professional identity develops. This paper aims to understand how CS undergraduate students develop their professional identity through analyzing students' reflection on their career goals, experiences in CS degree programs, and engagement in professional development. We present findings from qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with CS undergraduate students in the United States. We found that CS undergraduates form their computing professional identity typically between Years 2-3 of their degree programs. We identified several reasons students are committed to a computing profession: intrinsic factors (e.g., interest and perception of ability), and discipline-specific factors (e.g. utility and growth). We also found several factors that shape their professional identity: coursework, informal activities like hackathons, and professional development activities including internships and conferences. These findings suggest that the development of computing professional identity is not limited to students' involvement in the academic degree programs but the engagement they have with the broader computing community.","Kapoor, Amanpreet and Gardner-McCune, Christina","professional identity, identity, career choices, professional development",10.1145/3304221.3319764,2019,7

New trends are emerging on how to develop this technical and soft skills. Collaborative learning and social cognitive theory were adopted as a theoretical foundation for this study as limited studies have been done to find out which frameworks has been consistent to determine students' computer programming experience using the Hackathon. This paper aim to evaluate the effectiveness of collaboration in a Hackathon environment to learn Computer Programming (CP) among IT students. The objectives of the study are: (i) to examine the influence of collaboration on students' CP skills (ii) to examine the influence of Hackathon on students' computer programming skills (iii) to study the statistical association between collaborative learning and Hackathon on students' CP skills. 80 students participated in this study through a survey method and the responses was analyzed using SPSS software. The results of the study indicate that students were satisfied with their collaborative learning experience and believed that the Hackathon approach will help them in developing computer programming technical and soft skill. This study develops a model and contributes to empirical studies on Hackathon as most studies in this field are based on anecdotal findings.,"Mhlongo, Sakhumuzi and Oyetade, Kayode Emmanuel and Zuva, Tranos",,10.1109/IMITEC50163.2020.9334089,2020,6
inproceedings,A Hackathon Methodology for Undergraduate Course Projects,"In this innovative practice full paper we present a methodology for organizing a hackathon as a learning instrument within the scope of an undergraduate course. Hackathons are short events (1 to 3 days), where participants motivated by a common challenge gather into groups to build a software or hardware prototype. Studies show that learning is one of the main motivators of hackathon participants. Researchers are also pointing out the importance of hackathons as an informal learning approach for college students. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. This motivated us to bring that practice to the classroom, by offering an undergraduate course where students develop their semester project within a hackathon. In an attempt to systematize the steps, compress and optimize the time allocated for the ideation phase of hackathon projects, we propose a methodology for hackathons in an educational setting. The approach combines concepts from Challenge-based Learning and Design Thinking in a sequence of activities that streamlines the ideation process with regular deliveries in short time frames. This results in objective discussions and quick decision taking, fastly arriving at a project idea where students apply what they learned over the semester. We applied our approach in an Internet of Things undergraduate course within the scope of a semester project developed in an authentic 24-hour hackathon that took place in a maker space. This article details the methodology and presents a mixed methods study to analyze the students' perception on using this set of practices and techniques.","Gama, Kiev and Alencar, Breno and Calegario, Filipe and Neves, André and Alessio, Pedro",,10.1109/FIE.2018.8659264,2018,9
inproceedings,Industrial Experiences of Organizing a Hackathon to Assess a Device-centric Cloud Ecosystem,"A hackathon (hacking marathon) is an event to innovate and develop prototypes, typically lasting at most a few days. Despite several innovations having been reported resulting from hackathons and the increasing popularity of hackathons, results about, organizing of, and experiences regarding hackathons have been scarcely reported. We studied a hackathon as a means to assess a device-centric cloud ecosystem in industrial settings. We provide a descriptive account of a three-days hackathon. The experience was that the hackathon was realistic as well as an efficient and effective assessment of the requirements and design of the ecosystem, providing guidance for future development. We also summarize the lessons learned about successfully organizing a hackathon. The results also highlight encouraging experience about the hackathon among the participants in terms of the social benefits, such as collaboration, inspiration, and work motivation, resulting in repeating hackathons for various purposes in the near future. In general, the results indicate a hackathon as a promising new approach in software engineering, where speed of development is becoming essential.","Raatikainen, Mikko and Komssi, Marko and Bianco, Vittorio dal and Kindstöm, Klas and Järvinen, Janne",,10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.130,2013,10
inproceedings,Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies for Intellectual Capital (re)generation: An emerging framework,"Hackathons are events that bring together people with diverse backgrounds and expertise in a single location over a limited time to develop disruptive ideas and artifacts. The skyrocketing success of Hackathons across various domains and sectors is due to the opportunities they offer to leverage the creative and Intellectual capacity of the crowd, and to develop new relationships, skills, knowledge, solutions, and processes. However, Hackathons' potential in relation to Intellectual Capital (IC) has been overlooked by the literature so far, and few studies focus on their outcomes and evaluation. This study addresses this issue by conceptualizing Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies whose value proposition includes the (re)generation of IC at the system level. Based on this conceptualization, we leverage the authors' participant observation through active involvement in 57 Hackathons globally with various roles (i.e., participant, mentor, facilitator, jury, and organizer) between 2014-2020. Through iterative qualitative analysis carried out on the literature and empirical material, we identify 32 distinctive critical attributes through which Hackathons may differ from one another. We leverage the literature and the empirical material to highlight how each of these 32 attributes may influence the three key dimensions of IC (i.e., Human, Relational, and Structural). Our analysis offers a framework that can be useful for practitioners when approaching Hackathons and serve as a foundation for design and evaluation instruments, while opening the way for future research on Hackathons as emerging organizational forms specifically devoted to IC (re)generation.","Grande, Simona and Franco, Mattia and De Bernardi, Paola and Ricciardi, Francesca",,10.1109/ICTMOD49425.2020.9380595,2020,5
inproceedings,Are Hackathons the New e-Learning Environments? On the Outcome of the #WirVsVirus Hackathon From a Learning Outcome Perspective,"The unprecedented situation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic holds seed grains for novel phenomena in the field of innovative learning experiences: Virtual hackathon events might represent a new form of remote co-creation, learning and upskilling. The #WirVsVirus hackathon event in Germany has been initiated by the government to compensate the lockdown-related absence of physical innovation experiences. By analyzing the data set of projects initialized during the hackathon event (n = 1,499), plus the qualitative survey feedback from 956 participants, we found that the learning curve as well as the individual learning outcome for the participates is substantial. Our findings presented in this paper lead to the conclusion that hackathons are a prosperous learning environment, even more out-come oriented than other e-Learning formats.","Krüger, Nicolai and Teuteberg, Frank",,10.1109/econf51404.2020.9385424,2020,4
inproceedings,A Systematic Mapping Study on the Organisation of Corporate Hackathons,"The hackathon phenomenon has just completed twenty years. During this period, it shifted from an event where highly skilled developers searched for bugs or randomly created a software solution to an organised event for exploring a set of technologies, challenges or themes. When promoted by software companies, these events are called corporate hackathons and mainly seek to improve their business activities by getting new ideas, prototypes or even business plans. By involving third parties, corporate hackathons become an open innovation strategy used by companies to ultimately leverage platforms and build a community of users around them, as a mechanism to establish a software ecosystem. This paper results from our motivation to understand how corporate hackathons are organised in IT industry. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study on corporate hackathons, focusing on their process (i.e. steps involved in before, during and after a hackathon) and their main characteristics (goals, participants, duration, location, and application domain). As main contribution, we reveal organisation patterns and provide recommendations for companies aiming to conduct hackathons.","Valença, George and Lacerda, Nycolas and de Souza, Cleidson R B. and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00074,2020,8
inproceedings,Hackathons in Software Engineering Education - Lessons Learned from a Decade of Events,"Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.","Porras, Jari and Khakurel, Jayden and Ikonen, Jouni and Happonen, Ari and Knutas, Antti and Herala, Antti and Drögehorn, Olaf",,,2018,8
inproceedings,Student perception of the contribution of Hackathon and collaborative learning approach on computer programming pass rate,"According to [8] the student's learning inspiration and adequacy can be influenced by several environmental factors which includes the learning approach and social pressure from class mates. The aim of this study is to investigate students' perceptions about the contribution of collaborative learning and the Hackathon to improve computer programming pass rate. The study included both the undergraduate and post-graduate full-time, Information Technology (IT) students at the Durban University of Technology and a selfadministered survey was used. Social cognitive theory and collaborative learning are the core theoretical frameworks that underpins this study. The outcome of students' perception was analyzed using IBM SPSS. It was found that students that collaborated with others on assignments felt that their computer programming marks would improve when participating in Hackathons. The results from this study also revealed that a high number of students are satisfied with their collaborative learning experience.","Sakhumuzi, Mhlongo Donald and Emmanuel, Oyetade Kayode",,10.1109/ICTAS.2017.7920524,2017,5
inproceedings,Effects of a Hackathon on the Motivation and Grades of CS1 Students,"Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.","Bonilla, Rafael I. and Granda, Roger and Lozano, Estefanía",,10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125187,2020,6
inproceedings,Hackathon as a Project Based Teaching Tool : Employing Programming Challenge in the Class,"Project Based Learning (PBL) develops student knowledge and skills through solving authentic, engaging and complex challenge in a fixed time span. Academic literature reports its application over a wide variety of disciplines, having both immediate and long-lasting positive effect on team working, project management, and creativity when applying technical skills. We aim to enhance student learning in software engineering. 80% of student respondents up to the date feel that programming assignments that last longer than a week overlap with other subjects enough to draw dedication away. While it unquestionably develops transferable skills, such as time management, it also might not necessarily be good through introductory courses, where students face completely new material. As a result, our aim is to employ “hackathon” - a gathering, where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over 12 to 24 hours – as a teaching tool. While there is a precedent of hackathon being used at University level, it was employed to substitute classic approach via excluding lecturing and lab work completely. Current paper presents research design and relevant discussion on measuring and validating learning outcomes when blending hackathon into traditional programming class as one of the components, not a substitute to other types of classes.","Kumalakov, Bolatzhan and Kim, Alla and Mukhtarova, Salima and Shukurova, Assel and Khon, Natalya",,10.1109/ICAICT.2018.8747149,2018,5

inproceedings,Short Datathon for the Interdisciplinary Development of Data Analysis and Visualization Skills,"Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests, Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper, we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.","Noguera Salinas, Myrian Raquel and Figueiredo Pereira Emer, Maria Claudia and Serra Seca Neto, Adolfo Gustavo",,10.1109/CHASE.2019.00031,2019,4
inproceedings,Hack for the homeless: A humanitarian technology hackathon,"In this paper, we discuss our experiences with, and the outcomes of, a hackathon for undergraduates centered on the topic of technology for the homeless. Working closely with a partner NGO, we provided students with ideas, a sample database, programming tutorials and design feedback. Our hackathon was very successful, resulting in high-quality work and student engagement. In addition to reporting on lessons learned, we will also discuss the top two projects. One was Homeless Helpline, an automated voice system that allows homeless clients to call in and receive information about the services available to them in their area. This project ties into our partner NGO's existing database to automatically extract the information needed for the user, allowing anyone with access to a phone - even a payphone or a feature cell phone - to get access to this information, with very little cost to the NGO. The other project we discuss takes a different approach, making the same information available as a smartphone app, allowing the user to get more precise information about the services closest to their current location, alongside directions, etc. The hackathon was successful enough that we intend to make it an annual event. The paper will also discuss our thoughts on how to host your own successful socially-motivated hackathon for undergraduates.","Linnell, Natalie and Figueira, Silvia and Chintala, Neil and Falzarano, Lauren and Ciancio, Vincente",,10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970341,2014,8

We choose to use an internal hackathon approach that focuses on technical collaboration between case study owners and tool/method providers. The novelty of the approach is that we organize the technical workshop at our regular project progress meetings as a challenge-based contest involving all partners in the project. Case study partners submit their challenges related to the project goals and their use cases in advance. These challenges are concise enough to be experimented within approximately 4 hours. Teams are then formed to address those challenges. The teams include tool/method providers, case study owners and researchers/developers from other consortium members. On the hackathon day, partners work together to come with results addressing the challenges that are both interesting to encourage collaboration and convincing to continue further deeper investigations. Obtained results demonstrate that the hackathon approach stimulated knowledge exchanges among project partners and triggered new collaborations, notably between tool providers and use case owners.","Sadovykh, Andrey and Truscan, Dragos and Pierini, Pierluigi and Widforss, Gunnar and Ashraf, Adnan and Bruneliere, Hugo and Smrz, Pavel and Bagnato, Alessandra and Afzal, Wasif and Hortelano, Alexandra Espinosa",,10.23919/DATE.2019.8715247,2019,6

Therefore, it has become important to address the issue of participation of older adults in the process of developing solutions suitable for their group. In this study, we approached this topic by organizing a hackathon involving teams of young programmers and older adult participants. In our paper we describe a case study of that hackathon, in which our objective was to motivate older adults to participate in software engineering processes. Based on our results from an array of qualitative methods, we propose a set of good practices that may lead to improved older adult participation in similar events and an improved process of developing apps that target older adults.","Kopec, Wieslaw and Balcerzak, Bartlomiej and Nielek, Radoslaw and Kowalik, Grzegorz and Wierzbicki, Adam and Casati, Fabio",,10.1145/3180155.3182547,2018,2

However, the number of women participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers, designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.","Paganini, Lavínia and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/RITA.2020.3033209,2020,10

article,An IoT and Wearable Technology Hackathon for Promoting Careers in Computer Science,"This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a “hackathon,” to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students’ motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon event and a model for 21st century learning can be effective in motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and wearables.","Byrne, Jake Rowan and O’Sullivan, Katriona and Sullivan, Kevin",,10.1109/TE.2016.2626252,2017,9
article,A Systems Engineering Hackathon – A Methodology Involving Multiple Stakeholders to Progress Conceptual Design of a Complex Engineered Product,"This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and communication of information across traditional engineering and operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured around the technical functions within an engineering company has the capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80% reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with using current/regular internal methods.","Saravi, S. and Joannou, D. and Kalawsky, R.

inproceedings,Improving Student’s Learning and Cooperation Skills Using Coding Dojos (In the Wild!),"Collaborative development approaches (e.g., pair programming, coding dojo, and hackathons) have gained increasing attention in recent years, mostly because they help to share knowledge during software development activities and might shorten development cycles and increase the quality of software products. Collaborative development approaches bring also the potential benefit to contribute to learning activities. For instance, novices might participate on collaborative development sessions in order to learn new development practices, tools, and techniques used in a software development project. Besides these potential benefits, little is known about the perception of students engaged in collaborative development efforts. Therefore, in this paper we investigate whether or not the engagement of students in collaborative development efforts contributes to the learning process of software development practices and techniques, as well as the perceived benefits and challenges related to collaborative software development activities. To this end, we first performed several of coding dojo sessions during a period of 18 months. These development sessions have been conducted within the context of a real software modernization effort, which aims to modernize two enterprise systems of the Brazilian Army. After that, we carried out a qualitative study where the participants (students, software developers, and software architects) answered a survey, in order to understand the learning benefits of using coding dojo in software development activities. The results so far are encouraging. Coding Dojos allowed professors and software architects to seamless share their experience in software development with the students. According to the answers, the methodology created a better environment for the team, allowing better discussions and ideas to be shared and implemented. This has helped the team members to solve problems easier than by themselves, bringing additional benefits, such as steep the learning curve in programming languages, usage of development tools, understanding the requirements, and code refactoring.","de Oliveira, Caio Matheus Campos and Canedo, Edna Dias and Faria, Henrique and Amaral, Luis Henrique Vieira and Bonifácio, Rodrigo",,10.1109/FIE.2018.8659056,2018,8

inproceedings,"EnerGyan: A Portable Platform for Microgrid Education, Research, and Development","Energy management for microgrids is becoming an increasingly important topic for effective integration of diverse electricity sources and loads. Real-world deployment of microgrids requires hands-on experience in three key areas: education, research, and development. Most undergraduate and graduate classes on microgrids today take a theoretical learning approach, and the few that offer laboratory sessions often use analog based systems. In the microgrid research community, advanced control and optimization are often validated using numerical simulations or very specific and expensive lab hardware. This area of study also lacks a development platform for users to do rapid prototyping of microgrid solutions, making real-world implementation challenging. This paper introduces EnerGyan [1], a low-cost platform for education, research, and development for energy management in microgrids. It is a portable end-to-end platform which integrates energy infrastructure (energy sources, converters, storage, loads), communication and computing infrastructure (on-board computer, communication modules, user interfaces), and an energy management system, making it a programmable electricity-grid-in-a-box. EnerGyan also provides a software toolkit called EnerGyanToolKit, allowing users to develop and deploy energy applications. EnerGyan has been used for microgrid research, in teaching (workshops, lab course, hackathons), and as development tool (for managing a building microgrid).","Manur, Ashray and Sehloff, David and Venkataramanan, Giri",,10.1109/PEDES.2018.8707745,2018,6

inproceedings,Development of individual learning paths system in engineering education,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents development of individual learning paths system in engineering education using the example of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). A set of technological approaches, called Industry 4.0, appeared about 10 years ago. The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future. The system of engineering education is based on the principles of individualization of educational and professional paths, practical orientation, development of soft skills, mobility. Personal education path - it's not just a student's choice, but it's very labor-intensive, properly designed work of educational institution, where not only the whole university is engaged, but also its partner employers.The Moscow Aviation Institute is implementing the integrated concept of ""personalization"". The peculiarity of individual learning path at the university is that at the first stage of its formation the potential direction and place of professional activity are determined, the necessary competencies to be acquired are accounted, and an individual development plan is formed. The holders of the typical student paths at Moscow Aviation Institute are the internal employer-divisions - Competency Centers, which have become the integrators of forward-looking technologies and are conducting a large number of projects commissioned by the industry. Also, the MAI Competence Centers help students to form the path to the professions in demand in the future, providing an opportunity for practice and mastering additional engineering, technological and managerial competences.Students comprehend their personal learning pathways at three levels. First at the level of the educational program through the identification of elective courses and places of practice after consultation with the tutor. Second, at the academic level, they master the chapters and topics that are the most relevant to student's current or future professional activity. Finally, a committed student can use internships, hackathons, Academic exchange and many other ways to form a unique path, outside the formal learning process.At the same time, an important task is the formation of healthy competition between students in obtaining access to certain modules of individual path.","Pogosyan, Mikhail A.",,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274140,2020,8

article,ITS+DM Hackathon (ITSC 2017): Lane Departure Prediction With Naturalistic Driving Data,"On October 16th, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan, from 8:00 to 18:00, the first Intelligent Transportation Systems plus Data Mining challenge was organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving problem: Lane Departure detection. This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting, but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to expect outstanding results ? the best one was only slightly over 3% above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking into consideration for example computer power load of the different algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of view.","Alekseenko, Andrey and Dang, Hien Q. and Bansal, Gaurav and Sanchez-Medina, Javier and Miyajima, Chiyomi and Hirayama, Takatsugu and Takeda, Kazuya and Ide, Ichiro",,10.1109/MITS.2018.2880264,2019,16
inproceedings,Machine Learning based Predicting House Prices using Regression Techniques,"Predictive models for determining the sale price of houses in cities like Bengaluru is still remaining as more challenging and tricky task. The sale price of properties in cities like Bengaluru depends on a number of interdependent factors. Key factors that might affect the price include area of the property, location of the property and its amenities. In this research work, an analytical study has been carried out by considering the data set that remains open to the public by illustrating the available housing properties in machine hackathon platform. The data set has nine features. In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XG Boost). Such models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on the predictive errors obtained between these models. Here, the attempt is to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on factors that affects the price.","Manasa, J and Gupta, Radha and Narahari, N S",,10.1109/ICIMIA48430.2020.9074952,2020,7
article,Video Game Development in a Rush: A Survey of the Global Game Jam Participants,"Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several studies have reported that periods of “crunch time” are prevalent in the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration, minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities. Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic “crunch time” and argue that game jam organizers are in a good position to problematize the phenomenon.","Borg, Markus and Garousi, Vahid and Mahmoud, Anas and Olsson, Thomas and Stålberg, Oskar",,10.1109/TG.2019.2910248,2020,14
article,Evaluating Processes to Certify Mobile Applications During Developer Relations Activities,"In a Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO), the software organizations have opened up their structures to third-party developers aiming to reach goals to ensure the MSECO is working properly, such as increasing number of users, mobile applications (apps) and developers. Thus, the management organization (keystone) by their Developer Relations (DevRel) teams must restructure its processes to support third-party developers and create ways to attract the development of apps. The development of apps during events planned and conducted by DevRel team (e.g., hackathons or developer conferences) requires an approach that allows developers to achieve the expected performance into the MSECO. However, there is a quality contribution barrier, the App Store, the App Store's criteria do not guarantee that apps certified by these criteria have good performance in number of downloads and positive reviews into the MSECO. Aims: We present an evaluation of a mobile certification approach for the MSECO context, called MSECO-CERT (Mobile Software ECOsystem app CERTification), in terms of mobile application downloads, ratings and changes in developers' attitudes. MSECO-CERT comprises support (MSECO-SUP) and development (MSECO-DEV) processes. We describe two empirical studies: feasibility and observational. MSECO-CERT produced a growth coefficient of downloads (363%) and average user ratings (28%) when compared to an ad hoc approach. We observed that the DevRel practitioners (i.e., developer evangelists) and most of the developers (70%) considered MSECO-SUP and MSECO-DEV processes easy to use. They indicate that they would use both processes in the future. The results indicate that a keystone needs to invest in the analysis of their certification processes considering the ecosystem elements and also create mechanisms that allow monitoring the effect of DevRel activities. Our studies also helped to evolve MSECO-CERT by refining roles, activities and artifacts.","Fontão, Awdren and Paes, Pedro and Ekwoge, Oswald and Santos, Rodrigo Pereira Dos and Dias-Neto, Arilo Claudio",,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009921,2020,15

The aim of this research is to identify problems in the employers' circle when it comes to hiring fresh graduates. The educational system is critical to information about the needs of employers in order to adapt educational programs to the needs of the labor market, to formulate learning outcomes in education programs and define occupational standards. The focus is on key competencies of candidates that are indispensable in today's labor market. The paper will show: what are the expectations of companies that actively seek workers? What are the priority competencies? Is there a scale of expected competencies? We want to find out how participants in the labor market are thinking about cooperation with educational institutions and which concrete ways of cooperation are considered effective in terms of training. What is the relationship between business and institutional education in defining and developing competency requirements? We proceed from the assumption that key skills create the competitive advantage of graduates because they talk about how they use their expertise.

article,"An Extended Hackathon Model for Collaborative Education in Medical
Innovation","To support the next generation of healthcare innovators - whether they
be engineers, designers, clinicians, or business experts by training -
education in the emerging field of medical innovation should be made
easily and widely accessible to undergraduate students, graduate
students, and young professionals, early in their careers. Currently,
medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or
year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a
limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure
and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that
seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible
and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended
hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245
participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016,
2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo
Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to
self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were
administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants
hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of
expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161)
saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1\%, P<0.001) from their pre-
to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is
presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and
graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation.
Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten
categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of
extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation
knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of
participants surveyed.","Wang, Jason K. and Pamnani, Ravinder D. and Capasso, Robson and Chang,

article,"The Effects of Hackathons on the Entrepreneurial Skillset and Perceived
Self-Efficacy as Factors Shaping Entrepreneurial Intentions","Purpose: While traditional university programs primarily use regularly
scheduled classes as the primary means for developing students, this
program evaluation explores the direct effects of intensive
entrepreneurial learning activity in the format of a hackathon. This is
one of the first papers to explore the learning outcomes of hackathons
as an intensive entrepreneurial pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach:
The researchers implemented a pre-test/post-test model with students
participating in an entrepreneurship hackathon and tested the changes in
their confidence levels in the ability to craft a successful
entrepreneurial venture. Findings: The results support a hackathon model
of entrepreneurial learning. As the result of a one-day workshop,
significant results were achieved for self-reported ability in
identifying a viable entrepreneurial concept, and for having the ability
to successfully launch a new venture. Further, class standing and prior
entrepreneurial courses, as well as gender did not influence the
learning outcomes. Importantly, while hackathon-generated increases in
entrepreneurial self-efficacy proved to be statistically significant,
same gains proved not to be significant in a traditional
entrepreneurship class setting. Authors conclude that short, intensive
entrepreneurship learning methods like hackathons may be more effective
in developing entrepreneurial self-efficacy than semester long courses.
Originality/value: A hackathon is likely an effective entrepreneurial
learning methodology suitable for a general student population which
includes students with limited knowledge of and interest in
entrepreneurship. The usefulness of a hackathon for entrepreneurial
learning has potential implications for educators, scholars and policy
makers. For educators, a hackathon approach may outperform a number of
traditional entrepreneurship pedagogies in the form of lectures, case
studies, class discussions or even a business plan development over a
semester-long course. A hackathon may also allow students to gain
entrepreneurial skills and self-confidence much quicker and using less
resources than in a traditional entrepreneurial course. The potential
reasons for these findings as well as their implications are discussed
along with future research areas.","Szymanska, Izabela and Sesti, Tom and Motley, Hali and Puia, George","entrepreneurial learning; hackathons; entrepreneurial self-efficacy;

technology in general, require complex interactions within
multidisciplinary teams. Healthcare hackathons are being increasingly
used as a model for cross-disciplinary collaboration and learning. The
aim of this study is to explore high school student learning experiences
during a healthcare hackathon. By optimizing their learning experiences,
we hope to prepare a future workforce that can bridge technical and
health fields and work seamlessly across disciplines.
Methods: A qualitative exploratory study utilizing focus group
interviews was conducted. Eight high school students from the hackathon
were invited to participate in this study through convenience sampling
Participating students (n = 8) were allocated into three focus groups.
Semi structured interviews were completed, and transcripts evaluated
using inductive thematic analysis.
Findings: Through the structured analysis of focus group transcripts
three major themes emerged from the data: (1) Collaboration, (2)
Transferable knowledge and skills, and (3) Expectations about
hackathons. These themes highlight strengths and potential barriers when
bringing this multidisciplinary approach to high school students and the
healthcare community.
Conclusion: This study found that students were empowered by the
interdisciplinary experience during a hackathon and felt that the
knowledge and skills gained could be applied in real world settings.
However, addressing student expectations of hackathons prior to the
event is an area for improvement. These findings have implications for
future hackathons and can spur further research into using the hackathon

article,"A Men Who Have Sex With Men-Friendly Doctor Finder Hackathon in
Guangzhou, China: Development of a Mobile Health Intervention to Enhance
Health Care Utilization","Background: Mobile health (mHeath)-based HIV and sexual health promotion
among men who have sex with men (MSM) is feasible in low- and
middle-income settings. However, many currently available mHealth tools
on the market were developed by the private sector for profit and have
limited input from MSM communities.
Objective: A health hackathon is an intensive contest that brings
together participants from multidisciplinary backgrounds to develop a
proposed solution for a specific health issue within a short period. The
purpose of this paper was to describe a hackathon event that aimed to
develop an mHealth tool to enhance health care (specifically HIV
prevention) utilization among Chinese MSM, summarize characteristics of
the final prototypes, and discuss implications for future mHealth
intervention development.
Methods: The hackathon took place in Guangzhou, China. An open call for
hackathon participants was advertised on 3 Chinese social media
platforms, including Blued, a popular social networking app among MSM.
All applicants completed a Web-based survey and were then scored. The
top scoring applicants were grouped into teams based on their skills and
content area expertise. Each team was allowed 1 month to prepare for the
hackathon. The teams then came together in person with on-site expert
mentorship for a 72-hour hackathon contest to develop and present
mHealth prototype solutions. The judging panel included experts in
psychology, public health, computer science, social media, clinical
medicine, and MSM advocacy. The final prototypes were evaluated based on
innovation, usability, and feasibility.
Results: We received 92 applicants, and 38 of them were selected to
attend the April 2019 hackathon. A total of 8 teams were formed,
including expertise in computer science, user interface design, business
or marketing, clinical medicine, and public health. Moreover, 24
participants self-identified as gay, and 3 participants self-identified
as bisexual. All teams successfully developed a prototype tool. A total
of 4 prototypes were designed as a mini program that could be embedded
within a popular Chinese social networking app, and 3 prototypes were
designed as stand-alone apps. Common prototype functions included
Web-based physician searching based on one's location (8 prototypes),
health education (4 prototypes), Web-based health counseling with
providers or lay health volunteers (6 prototypes), appointment
scheduling (8 prototypes), and between-user communication (2
prototypes). All prototypes included strategies to ensure privacy
protection for MSM users, and some prototypes offered strategies to
ensure privacy of physicians. The selected prototypes are undergoing
pilot testing.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability
of using a hackathon to create mHealth intervention tools. This suggests
a different pathway to developing mHealth interventions and could be
relevant in other settings.","Li, Chunyan and Xiong, Yuan and Sit, Hao Fong and Tang, Weiming and

article,"Institutionalizing healthcare hackathons to promote diversity in
collaboration in medicine","BackgroundMedical students and healthcare professionals can benefit from
exposure to cross-disciplinary teamwork and core concepts of medical
innovation. Indeed, to address complex challenges in patient care,
diversity in collaboration across medicine, engineering, business, and
design is critical. However, a limited number of academic institutions
have established cross-disciplinary opportunities for students and young
professionals within these domains to work collaboratively towards
diverse healthcare needs.MethodsDrawing upon best practices from
computer science and engineering, healthcare hackathons bring together
interdisciplinary teams of students and professionals to collaborate,
brainstorm, and build solutions to unmet clinical needs. Over the course
of six months, a committee of 20 undergraduates, medical students, and
physician advisors organized Stanford University's first healthcare
hackathon (November 2016). Demographic data from initial applications
were supplemented with responses from a post-hackathon survey gauging
themes of diversity in collaboration, professional development, interest
in medical innovation, and educational value. In designing and
evaluating the event, the committee focused on measurable outcomes of
diversity across participants (skillset, age, gender, academic degree),
ideas (clinical needs), and innovations (projects).ResultsDemographic
data (n=587 applicants, n=257 participants) reveal participants across
diverse academic backgrounds, age groups, and domains of expertise were
in attendance. From 50 clinical needs presented representing 19 academic
fields, 40 teams ultimately formed and submitted projects spanning web
(n=13) and mobile applications (n=13), artificial intelligence-based
tools (n=6), and medical devices (n=3), among others. In post-hackathon
survey responses (n=111), medical students and healthcare professionals
alike noted a positive impact on their ability to work in
multidisciplinary teams, learn from individuals of different
backgrounds, and address complex healthcare
challenges.ConclusionsHealthcare hackathons can encourage diversity
across individuals, ideas, and projects to address clinical challenges.
By providing an outline of Stanford's inaugural event, we hope more
universities can adopt the healthcare hackathon model to promote
diversity in collaboration in medicine.","Wang, Jason K. and Roy, Shivaal K. and Barry, Michele and Chang, Robert

Computer Science","This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning
model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a ``hackathon,{''}
to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a
particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity
students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to
foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to
introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a
narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students
participated in the workshop and completed pre-and post-surveys, and a
free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in
computing. Analysis revealed that students' motivation to learn about
the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable
technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following
participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and
outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in
the computing word associations, with students associating computing
more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as
the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon
event and a model for 21st-century learning can be effective in
motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers

Event Report of an mHealth Hackathon in Thailand","Hackathons are intense, short, collaborative events focusing on solving
real world problems through interdisciplinary teams. This is a report of
the mHealth hackathon hosted by Khon Kaen University in collaboration
with MIT Sana and faculty members from Harvard Medical School with the
aim to improve health care delivery in the Northeast region of Thailand.
Key health challenges, such as improving population health literacy,
tracking disease trajectory and outcomes among rural communities, and
supporting the workflow of overburdened frontline providers, were
addressed using mHealth. Many modifications from the usual format of
hackathon were made to tailor the event to the local context and
culture, such as the process of recruiting participants and how teams
were matched and formed. These modifications serve as good learning
points for hosting future hackathons. There are also many lessons
learned about how to achieve a fruitful collaboration despite cultural
barriers, how to best provide mentorship to the participants, how to
instill in the participants a sense of mission, and how to match the
participants in a fair and efficient manner. This event showcases how
interdisciplinary collaboration can produce results that are
unattainable by any discipline alone and demonstrates that innovations
are the fruits of collective wisdom of people from different fields of

Identify Cloud Infrastructure Requirements","A wealth of viral data sits untapped in publicly available metagenomic
data sets when it might be extracted to create a usable index for the
virological research community. We hypothesized that work of this
complexity and scale could be done in a hackathon setting. Ten teams
comprised of over 40 participants from six countries, assembled to
create a crowd-sourced set of analysis and processing pipelines for a
complex biological data set in a three-day event on the San Diego State
University campus starting 9 January 2019. Prior to the hackathon,
141,676 metagenomic data sets from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) were pre-assembled into
contiguous assemblies (contigs) by NCBI staff. During the hackathon, a
subset consisting of 2953 SRA data sets (approximately 55 million
contigs) was selected, which were further filtered for a minimal length
of 1 kb. This resulted in 4.2 million (Mio) contigs, which were aligned
using BLAST against all known virus genomes, phylogenetically clustered
and assigned metadata. Out of the 4.2 Mio contigs, 360,000 contigs were
labeled with domains and an additional subset containing 4400 contigs
was screened for virus or virus-like genes. The work yielded valuable
insights into both SRA data and the cloud infrastructure required to
support such efforts, revealing analysis bottlenecks and possible
workarounds thereof. Mainly: (i) Conservative assemblies of SRA data
improves initial analysis steps; (ii) existing bioinformatic software
with weak multithreading/multicore support can be elevated by wrapper
scripts to use all cores within a computing node; (iii) redesigning
existing bioinformatic algorithms for a cloud infrastructure to
facilitate its use for a wider audience; and (iv) a cloud infrastructure

development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in
this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a
diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision

communication of information across traditional engineering and
operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is
highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where
stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members
were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a
hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured
around the technical functions within an engineering company has the
capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale
for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon
method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better
manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall
design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it
can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80\%
reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with

article,"Hackathons as Stepping Stones in Health Care Innovation: Case Study With
Systematic Recommendations","Background: Until recently, developing health technologies was
time-consuming and expensive, and often involved patients, doctors, and
other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end
product. So far, users have been minimally involved in the ideation and
creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address
users' unmet needs, a transdisciplinary and user-led approach, involving
cocreation and direct user feedback, is required. In this context,
hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating
enthusiasm for user-centered innovation.
Objective: This case study describes preparatory steps and the
performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health
care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were
assessed, leading to the development of systematic recommendations for
future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care.
Methods: A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin,
Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field
notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the
research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in
December 2017 and November 2018 were included.
Results: In total, 30 participants took part, with 63\% (19/30) of
participants between 25 and 34 years of age, 30\% (9/30) between 35 and
44 years of age, and 7\% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of
43\% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of
medical experts, including patients and health care professionals, was
30\% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a
specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a
chatbot for skin cancer recognition, an augmented reality exposure-based
therapy (eg, for arachnophobia), an app for medical neighborhood
connectivity, a doctor appointment platform, and a self-care app for
people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals
initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in
significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was
followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for
conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n <= 30) were developed, including
aspects of community building, stakeholder engagement, mentoring,
themes, announcements, follow-up, and timing for each step.
Conclusions: This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing
innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and
potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital
product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to
other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led
innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary

aimed to examine, using open clinical data sources, relationships
between sex, obesity, diabetes, and exposure to airborne fine
particulate matter among patients with severe asthma. The goal was to
develop a proof of concept that this new model of collaboration and data
sharing could effectively produce meaningful scientific results and
generate new scientific hypotheses. Three Translator Clinical Knowledge
Sources, each of which provides open access (via Application Programming
Interfaces) to data derived from the electronic health record systems of
major academic institutions, served as the source of study data. Jupyter
Python notebooks, shared in GitHub repositories, were used to call the
knowledge sources and analyze and integrate the results. The results
replicated established or suspected relationships between sex, obesity,
diabetes, exposure to airborne fine particulate matter, and severe
asthma. In addition, the results demonstrated specific differences
across the three Translator Clinical Knowledge Sources, suggesting
cohort- and/or environment-specific factors related to the services
themselves or the catchment area from which each service derives patient
data. Collectively, this special communication demonstrates the power
and utility of intense, team-oriented hackathons and offers general
technical, organizational, and scientific lessons learned.","Fecho, Karamarie and Ahalt, Stanley C. and Arunachalam, Saravanan and

article,"What's taking so long? A collaborative method of collecting designers'
insight into what factors increase design effort levels in projects","Design effort is a key resource for product design projects.
Environments where design effort is scarce, and therefore valuable,
include hackathons and other time-limited design challenges. Predicting
design effort needs is key to successful project planning; therefore,
understanding design effort-influencing factors (objective
considerations that are universally accepted to exert influence on a
subject, that is, types of phenomena, constraints, characteristics, or
stimulus) will aid in planning success, offering an improved
organizational understanding of product design, characterizing the
design space and providing a perspective to assess project briefs from
the outset. This paper presents the Collaborative Factor Identification
for Design Effort (CoFIDE) Method based on Hird's (2012) method for
developing resource forecasting tools for new product development teams.
CoFIDE enables the collection of novel data of, and insight into, the
collaborative understanding and perceptions of the most influential
factors of design effort levels in design projects and how their
behavior changes over the course of design projects. CoFIDE also enables
design teams, hackathon teams, and makerspace collaborators to
characterize their creative spaces, to quickly enable mutual
understanding, without the need for complex software and large bodies of
past project data. This insight offers design teams, hackathon teams,
and makerspace collaborators opportunities to capitalize on positive
influences while minimizing negative influences. This paper demonstrates
the use of CoFIDE through a case study with a UK-based product design
agency, which enabled the design team to identify and model the behavior
of four influential factors.","Holliman, Alexander Freddie and Thomson, Avril and Hird, Abigail and

organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation
Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent
Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a
three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and
the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from
eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving
problem: Lane Departure detection.
This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions
submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting,
but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning
after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon
formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of
class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the
provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the
inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to
expect outstanding results - the best one was only slightly over 3\%
above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities
pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking
into consideration for example computer power load of the different
algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to
share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned
lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of

challenges. During a one- week design hackathon, we conducted a
collective design project in which three teams of participants conducted
autoethnography research, shared their findings by an idea crowdsourcing

article,Mining citizen emotions to estimate the urgency of urban issues,"Crowdsourcing technology offers exciting possibilities for local
governments. Specifically, citizens are increasingly taking part in
reporting and discussing issues related to their neighborhood and
problems they encounter on a daily basis, such as overflowing trashbins,
broken footpaths and lifts, illegal graffiti, and potholes. Pervasive
citizen participation enables local governments to respond more
efficiently to these urban issues. This interaction between citizens and
municipalities is largely promoted by civic engagement platforms, such
as See-Click-Fix, FixMyStreet, CitySourced, and OpenIDEO, which allow
citizens to report urban issues by entering free text describing what
needs to be done, fixed or changed. In order to develop appropriate
action plans and priorities, government officials need to figure out how
urgent are the reported issues. In this paper we propose to estimate the
urgency of urban issues by mining different emotions that are implicit
in the text describing the issue. More specifically, a reported issue is
first categorized according to the emotions expressed in it, and then
the corresponding emotion scores are combined in order to produce a
final urgency level for the reported issue. Our experiments use the
SeeClickFix hackathon data and diverse emotion classification
algorithms. They indicate that (i) emotions can be categorized
efficiently with supervised learning algorithms, and (ii) the use of
citizen emotions leads to accurate urgency estimates. Further, using
additional features such as the type of issue or its author leads to no
further accuracy gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Masdeval, Christian and Veloso, Adriano",Emotion classification; Networked citizenship; Crowdsourcing,10.1016/j.is.2015.06.008,2015,9

Participants","Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex
software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several
studies have reported that periods of ``crunch time{''} are prevalent in
the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of
time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global
Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results
suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular
method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration,
minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up
meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular
communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning
are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with
agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in
the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the
development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some
complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our
findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit
that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities.

challenges of seawater desalination industry in the Arabian Gulf","The hyper-arid climate of the Arabian Gulf makes it an excessively
water-deficient region. Ironically, the Gulf States count among the few
places with the highest per capita water consumption and low tariff.
Since a few decades ago, seawater desalination has been the most
reliable source of portable water in the Gulf. Recently, many critical
scholars raise concerns about the rising levels of brine discharge,
effects of water intake and outfall systems infrastructure, plants' high
energy consumption and fragmented regulatory and policy frameworks. In
this study, we explore the potentials of environmental governance in
addressing sustainability risks of seawater desalination projects. The
DPSIR model and the Earth system governance framework guided and
supported our analysis of several multidimensional issues that underlie
the characteristics of this industry. Thus, we identified 29 cause and
effect factors as well as nine environmental governance intervention
strategies. The study suggests that the industry's network of
stakeholders can develop good ideas for fostering sustainability by
using innovative tools such as hackathon-an interdisciplinary,
participatory, solution-oriented, and consensus building platform.

paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic
orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable
control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN
operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities,
security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture
itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data
centers, we propose a collaborative ``Network Security and Intrusion
Detection System(NIDS){''} scheme called ``VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne
secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks'. The SDN security
scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the
dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric
DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained
hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It
is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of
NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory
requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these
problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid
model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are
implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack
prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering,
feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the
practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters,
we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset,
and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of
normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by
organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network
hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is
capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98\%
under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller
interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70\% on an
average, and controller response time reduces by 40\%, without incurring
additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in
SDN stack. The comparisons of VARMAN under similar attack scenarios and
test environment, with related recent works that utilized ML-based NIDS,
demonstrate that our scheme offers higher accuracy, less than 5\% false
positive rate for various attack intensities and significant training

article,Entrofy your cohort: A transparent method for diverse cohort selection,"Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and
beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, and choosing
speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect
the selection of any particular candidate, and, thereby the composition
of the final cohort. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,entrofy,
designed to be part of a human-in-the-loop decision making strategy
aimed at making cohort selection as just, transparent, and accountable
as possible. We suggest embeddingentrofyin a two-step selection
procedure. During a merit review, the committee selects all applicants,
submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria.
This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the
second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool
via a new algorithm and software tool calledentrofy.entrofyoptimizes
differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human
committee. Criteria could include academic discipline, home country,
experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable
characteristics. Theentrofyalgorithm then yields the approximation of
pre-defined target proportions for each category by solving the
tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show
howentrofyselects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in
simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study
of Astro Hack Week. This two stage candidate and cohort selection
process allows human judgment and debate to guide the assessment of
candidates' merit in step 1. Then the human committee defines relevant
diversity criteria which will be used as computational parameters
inentrofy. Once the parameters are defined, the set of candidates who
meet the minimum threshold for merit are passed through theentrofycohort
selection procedure in step 2 which yields a cohort of a composition as
close as possible to the computational parameters defined by the
committee. This process has the benefit of separating the meritorious
assessment of candidates from certain elements of their diversity and
from some considerations around cohort composition. It also increases
the transparency and auditability of the process, which enables, but
does not guarantee, fairness. Splitting merit and diversity
considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to
explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected, though it does
not eliminate the possibility of objectionable bias.","Huppenkothen, Daniela and McFee, Brian and Noren, Laura",No data,10.1371/journal.pone.0231939,2020,No data
article,"The Role of Art in Emotional-Moral Reflection on Risky and Controversial
Technologies: the Case of BNCI","In this article, we explore the role that art can play in ethical
reflection on risky and controversial technologies. New technologies
often give rise to societal controversies about their potential risks
and benefits. Over the last decades, social scientists, psychologists,
and philosophers have criticized quantitative approaches to risk on the
grounds that they oversimplify its societal and ethical implications.
There is broad consensus amongst these scholars that stakeholders and
their values and concerns should be included in decision-making about
technological risks. It has also been argued that the emotional
responses of people can shed important light on the ethical aspects of
risk and uncertainty. However, people's emotions can be narrowly focused
and biased. This article therefore assesses the role that
technology-inspired artworks can play in overcoming such biases, by
challenging our imagination and providing us with different perspectives
on possible technological developments and their implications for
society. Philosophers have not yet studied such artworks, so this
constitutes an entirely new field of research for scholars of risk and
moral theory. In particular, we focus on the case of BNCI (Brain/Neural
Computer Interface) technologies and related artworks. These
technologies and artworks touch on questions of what it means to be
human, thereby raising profound ethical and philosophical challenges. We
discuss the experiences of artists, scientists, and engineers who are
directly involved with BNCI technologies, and who were interviewed
during a Hackathon at Amsterdam's Waag Society in June 2016. Their views
are analyzed in light of philosophical and aesthetic theories, which
allows us to consider relevant ethical and conceptual issues as well as
topics for further investigation.","Roeser, Sabine and Alfano, Veronica and Nevejan, Caroline","Risk; Controversial technologies; Art; Aesthetics; Emotions; Ethics;

article,Promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African context,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an intervention strategy
for promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African
context, followed by a reflection thereof based on qualitative data
collected from students. Career awareness during study has shown to be a
factor in the work-readiness of IT graduates.
Design/methodology/approach The paper suggests an intervention strategy
aimed at promoting IT students' career awareness. It provides context of
the exit-level higher education (HE) module used to implement the
intervention. Career awareness is achieved by industry talks, projects
and events. Interpretive data collection and content analysis are used
to understand the impact of the intervention from the students'
perspective. Findings Recommendations are made towards productive
interventions for raising career awareness among IT students using
industry participation in higher education. The proposed intervention
comprises of a combination of industry talks, capstone projects and
specific events. Students had largely positive reactions and made
suggestions for additional interventions they would find beneficial. A
hackathon attended proved the most influential where seven out of eight
involved students received job offers from one company. Other students
became aware of their own employability, limitations and preferred
career paths. Originality/value Findings provide confirmation on
existing feasible approaches and also introduces new interventions that
may be generalised to other fields of study. The paper not only provides
an instructional design for a module to raise career awareness but also
reflects on the feedback of the students. The reflection provided by
students acts as a point of reference to ensure that the process
followed for the intervention is practical within a South African
context. The paper highlights the perceived benefits of involving
industry in higher education to raise career awareness, factors that may
prevent career awareness among IT students and valuable suggestions made
by students to further enhance the intervention strategy. An implication
of the research is a set of guidelines identified towards bridging the
IT theory-practice gap. These guidelines can be used by many educators
in similar environments to justify their interventions.","van Rensburg, J. T. Janse and Goede, Roelien","Career awareness; Reflective practice; Industry involvement; Higher

interdependent data analysis workflows. Such bioinformatics workflows
take the primary and secondary input data through several
computationally-intensive processing steps using different software
packages, where some of the outputs form inputs for other steps.
Implementing scalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows
is particularly challenging.
Results: H3ABioNet has built four workflows to support (1) the calling
of variants from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) the analysis of
microbial populations from 16S rDNA sequence data; (3) genotyping and
genome-wide association studies; and (4) single nucleotide polymorphism
imputation. A week-long hackathon was organized in August 2016 with
participants from six African bioinformatics groups, and US and European
collaborators. Two of the workflows are built using the Common Workflow
Language framework (CWL) and two using Nextflow. All the workflows are
containerized for improved portability and reproducibility using Docker,
and are publicly available for use by members of the H3Africa consortium
and the international research community.
Conclusion: The H3ABioNet workflows have been implemented in view of
offering ease of use for the end user and high levels of reproducibility
and portability, all while following modern state of the art
bioinformatics data processing protocols. The H3ABioNet workflows will
service the H3Africa consortium projects and are currently in use. All
four workflows are also publicly available for research scientists
worldwide to use and adapt for their respective needs. The H3ABioNet
workflows will help develop bioinformatics capacity and assist genomics
research within Africa and serve to increase the scientific output of
H3Africa and its Pan-African Bioinformatics Network.","Baichoo, Shakuntala and Souilmi, Yassine and Panji, Sumir and Botha,

article,"A `Grantathon' model to mentor new investigators in mental health
research","Background: There is a critical gap between needs and available
resources for mental health treatment across the world, particularly in
low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In countries committed to
increasing resources to address these needs it is important to conduct
research, not only to assess the depth of mental health needs and the
current provision of public and private mental health services, but also
to examine implementation methods and evaluate mental health approaches
to determine which methods are most effective in local contexts.
However, research resources in many LMICs are inadequate, largely
because conventional research training is time-consuming and expensive.
Adapting a hackathon model may be a feasible method of increasing
capacity for mental health services research in resource-poor countries.
Methods: To explore the feasibility of this approach, we developed a
`grantathon', i.e. a research training workshop, to build capacity among
new investigators on implementation research of Indian government-funded
mental health programmes, which was based on a need expressed by
government agencies. The workshop was conducted in Delhi, India, and
brought together junior faculty members working in mental health
services settings throughout the country, experienced international
behavioural health researchers and representatives of the Indian Council
for Medical Research (ICMR), the prime Indian medical research funding
agency. Pre- and post-assessments were used to capture changes in
participants' perceived abilities to develop proposals, design research
studies, evaluate outcomes and develop collaborations with ICMR and
other researchers. Process measures were used to track the number of
single-or multi-site proposals that were generated and funded.
Results: Participants (n = 24) generated 12 single-or multi-site
research grant applications that will be funded by ICMR.
Conclusion: The grantathon model described herein can be modified to
build mental health services research capacity in other contexts. Given
that this workshop not only was conceptualised and delivered but also
returned results in less than 1 year, this model has the potential to
quickly build research capacity and ultimately reduce the mental health
treatment gap in resource-limited settings.","Hawk, Mary and Nimgaonkar, Vishwajit and Bhatia, Triptish and Brar,
