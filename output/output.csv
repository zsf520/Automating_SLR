inproceedings,Hackathons as a Pedagogical Strategy to Engage Students to Learn and to Adopt Software Engineering Practices,"Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.","Steglich, Caio and Salerno, Larissa and Fernandes, Tha\'{\i}s and Marczak, Sabrina and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana Paula and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio","Student Motivation, Case Study, Educational Hackathon, Software Engineering Education",10.1145/3422392.3422479,2020,10
inproceedings,An Online Educational Hackathon to Foster Professional Skills and Intense Collaboration on Software Engineering Students,"The global pandemic of COVID19 demanded that professors rethink teaching strategies considering the use of online environments due to the social isolation stipulated to reduce the rate of contagion of the disease. A challenge for software engineering professors is to develop fundamental professional skills in students who are in the process of learning using these virtual environments. The purpose of this study is to identify how an online educational hackathon can support students of a Software Engineering program to develop professional skills. We also seek to understand how intense collaboration takes place between student teams, considering the digital context for the production of a technological solution. We conducted a Case Study on an educational hackathon that took place in the online context, collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. As some results, the skills that students most considered that this hackathon helped them to develop were communication, initiative, and creativity/innovation, among others. Also, the strategies of collaboration adopted by the students during this competition, considering the remote context. Therefore, the main contribution is the identification of how the realization of this event supported students to develop professional skills and to practice collaboration skills with each other.","Steglich, Caio and Marczak, Sabrina and Guerra, Luiz and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana","Software Engineering Education, Intense Collaboration, Case Study, Educational Hackathon",10.1145/3474624.3476973,2021,10
inproceedings,Hack.Edu: Examining How College Hackathons Are Perceived By Student Attendees and Non-Attendees,"College hackathons have become popular in the past decade, with tens of thousands of students now participating each year across hundreds of campuses. Since hackathons are informal learning environments where students learn and practice coding without any faculty supervision, they are an important site for computing education researchers to study as a complement to studying formal classroom learning environments. However, despite their popularity, little is known about why students choose to attend these events, what they gain from attending, and conversely, why others choose *not* to attend. This paper presents a mixed methods study that examines student perceptions of college hackathons by focusing on three main questions: 1.) Why are students motivated to attend hackathons? 2.) What kind of learning environment do these events provide? 3.) What factors discourage students from attending? Through semi-structured interviews with six college hackathon attendees (50% female), direct observation at a hackathon, and 256 survey responses from college students (42% female), we discovered that students were motivated to attend for both social and technical reasons, that the format generated excitement and focus, and that learning occurred incidentally, opportunistically, and from peers. Those who chose not to attend or had negative experiences cited discouraging factors such as physical discomfort, lack of substance, an overly competitive climate, an unwelcoming culture, and fears of not having enough prior experience. We conclude by discussing ideas for making college hackathons more broadly inclusive and welcoming in light of our study's findings.","Warner, Jeremy and Guo, Philip J.","situated learning, college hackathon, informal learning",10.1145/3105726.3106174,2017,9
inproceedings,Hackathons as an Informal Learning Platform,"Hackathons are fast-paced events where competitors work in teams to go from an idea to working software or hardware within a single day or a weekend and demonstrate their creation to a live audience of peers. Due to the ""fun"" and informal nature of such events, they make for excellent informal learning platforms that attract a diverse spectrum of students, especially those typically uninterested in traditional classroom settings. In this paper, we investigate the informal learning aspects of Ohio State's annual hackathon events over the past two years, with over 100 student participants in 2013 and over 200 student participants in 2014. Despite the competitive nature of such events, we observed a significant amount of peer-learning -- students teaching each other how to solve specific challenges and learn new skills. The events featured mentors from both the university and industry, who provided round-the-clock hands-on support, troubleshooting and advice. Due to the gamified format of the events, students were heavily motivated to learn new skills due to practical applicability and peer effects, rather than merely academic metrics. Some teams continued their hacks as long-term projects, while others formed new student groups to host lectures and practice building prototypes on a regular basis. Using a combined analysis of post-event surveys, student academic records and source-code commit log data from the event, we share insights, demographics, statistics and anecdotes from hosting these hackathons.","Nandi, Arnab and Mandernach, Meris","hackathon, informal learning",10.1145/2839509.2844590,2016,6
inproceedings,Hackathon Approach: Its Contributions on Collaboration and Teamwork Skills: A Case Study in Maritime Sector,"The main objective of this study was to examine how the use of a hackathon approach impacts the collaboration and teamwork skills. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from an observation carried out during a hackathon conducted in France with 70 participants. A survey was also developed to analyse the participants’ perception of the different dimensions of the intra-team collaboration. In this study a positive impact of a hackathon was observed on the intra-team collaboration and on the development of hard and soft skills of the participants. The format of a hackathon could be used at the company scale to speed up employees’ learning process. Thus, team learning could be improved and accelerated by the hackathon approach, through the sharing of experience and knowledge of people with various backgrounds, the caring nature of the team, and their willingness to meet the challenge all together.","Lyonnet, Barbara","Hackathon approach, Skills, Ccollaborative learning, Information system management",10.1145/3510309.3510324,2022,8
article,Lucene4IR: Developing Information Retrieval Evaluation Resources Using Lucene,"The workshop and hackathon on developing Information Retrieval Evaluation Resources using Lucene (L4IR) was held on the 8th and 9th of September, 2016 at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK and funded by the ESF Elias Network. The event featured three main elements: (i) a series of keynote and invited talks on industry, teaching and evaluation; (ii) planning, coding and hacking where a number of groups created modules and infrastructure to use Lucene to undertake TREC based evaluations; and (iii) a number of breakout groups discussing challenges, opportunities and problems in bridging the divide between academia and industry, and how we can use Lucene for teaching and learning Information Retrieval (IR). The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.","Azzopardi, Leif and Moshfeghi, Yashar and Halvey, Martin and Alkhawaldeh, Rami S. and Balog, Krisztian and Di Buccio, Emanuele and Ceccarelli, Diego and Fern\'{a}ndez-Luna, Juan M. and Hull, Charlie and Mannix, Jake and Palchowdhury, Sauparna",No data,10.1145/3053408.3053421,2017,18
inproceedings,Developing Course Projects in a Hack Day: An Experience Report,"Some researchers are starting to point out the importance of hackathons as an alternative venue for college students practicing and learning. Many positive aspects were highlighted such as peer learning and improvements in problem-solving, project management and task priority analysis. However, this hackathon phenomena is something that is happening outside the curriculum, with scarce reports of teachers taking advantage of similar approaches in undergraduate courses. In this article, we present our experience of an undergraduate introductory course on Distributed Systems where students have to participate in a ""hack day"" at the end of the semester. The goal is to take advantage of the hackathon model to bring a more realistic and engaging scenario where students can develop their course project and put into practice what they have learned in the semester. With this model, they have to do face-to-face group work and also have the opportunity to share knowledge with other groups. Our experience indicates positive results with this approach. Students reported a high level of engagement and enthusiasm. There were different situations of peer learning being reported, and according to their perception, students felt they learned more in the hack day than in lectures or laboratory practice.","Gama, Kiev","hackathon, peer learning, challenge-based learning, project-based learning",10.1145/3304221.3319777,2019,7
inproceedings,Integrating Hackathons into an Online Cybersecurity Course,"Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.","Affia, Abasi-amefon Obot and Nolte, Alexander and Matulevi\v{c}ius, Raimundas","educational hackathon, cybersecurity education, online learning",10.1145/3510456.3514151,2022,12
inproceedings,Evaluating Effectiveness of Innovative Education Formats for 21st Century Skills: The Example of DaVinciLab YouthHackathon Workshops 2019/2020,"It has become increasingly important for youngsters to acquire digital competencies and 21st century skills. Schools across different countries have introduced in their curricula activities and topics on these efforts, however, to varying degrees and with varying effectiveness, depending on a number of reasons. In this paper we report on a study on the effectiveness of the DaVinciLab Youth Hackathon (YH) workshops as a form of intervention in the school system in order to increase digital competencies and 21st skills (4Cs - Communication, Collaboration, Critical Reflection and Creativity) among students and teachers as part of the implementation of basic digital education (Digitale Grundbildung) in Austrian schools. Our methodical research approach included participating observations of YH workshops in and outside the school setting, quantitative surveys and a literature review in the field of learning science. Our evaluation showed that the workshops can be an effective addition and support for schools to close current gaps in the curriculum for basic digital education and to implement parts of the curriculum through project and team-based teaching and learning methods. In order to integrate the format more strongly into the Austrian educational ecosystem, longer-term funding and better integration into training programs for teachers/in-service teachers would be needed. Finally, long-term support through research studies that are carried out in cooperation with different educational institutions could be helpful in future improvements.","Dorn, Amelie and Wandl-Vogt, Eveline and Romano, Anna and Jekel, Thomas and Gawin, Anna","Hackathons, Innovative Education formats, Basic Digital Education, Team-based learning, Scaffolding",10.1145/3434780.3436671,2021,7
inproceedings,Online Hackathons as an Engaging Tool to Promote Group Work in Emergency Remote Learning,"In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities had to be done remotely as a way to avoid the spread of the disease. Instead of shifting to an online learning model, it consisted of a transition to what was called Emergency Remote Teaching. This is a strategy to keep activities going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles for students to continue engaged.Before the pandemic, hackathons -- short-lived events (1 to 3 days) of intensive collaboration to develop software prototypes -- were being explored as an alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an online hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their semester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency remote teaching period. We describe the intervention and analyze the students' perspective of the approach. One of the findings was the importance of the Discord communication tool -- used by students for playing games -- which helped them socialize and be engaged in synchronous group work, ""virtually collocated"".","Gama, Kiev and Zimmerle, Carlos and Rossi, Pedro","emergency remote teaching, online learning, hackathons",10.1145/3430665.3456312,2021,7
inproceedings,Post-Hackathon Learning Circles: Supporting Lean Startup Development,"Hackathons provide rapid, hands-on opportunities to explore innovative solutions to problems, but provide little support to teams in moving those solutions into practice. We explore the use of post-hackathon Learning Circles to connect hackathon teams with key stakeholders, to reflect on prototypes and consider business models. We conducted a qualitative field study with 4 post-hackathon teams on the theme of technology, social isolation, and aging. Our results show that Learning Circles are an effective way to involve stakeholders early in the development process, and to develop a deeper understanding of users, markets, and technology.","Chan, Tina and McMurray, Josephine and Levy, AnneMarie and Sveistrup, Heidi and Wallace, James","participatory design, aging, social isolation, hackathon",10.1145/3334480.3375216,2020,8
inproceedings,Pros and Cons of Running Educational Hackathons in a Gender-Neutral Fashion,"Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.","Kovaleva, Yekaterina and Happonen, Ari and Hasheela-Mufeti, Victoria","intensive event, gender-neutral, code camp, stereotype, education, project-based, hackathon, time pressure, female",10.1145/3524501.3527603,2022,8
inproceedings,Understanding Female-Focused Hackathon Participants' Collaboration Styles and Event Goals,"Collegiate hackathons are informal learning environments where students build new projects in a limited amount of time and often compete for prizes. Previous hackathon research has shown that students go to these events to learn new technical skills, work on projects with friends, or network with the technical community; however, little is known about the different ways in which students collaborate with other participants and how students' event goals affect their trajectory at the hackathon. In the literature, students are typically described as working in competitive teams that build one project to be entered into a competition. However, there are gaps when it comes to discussing other ways students may work together or what other non-competitive projects/activities students may want to engage with at a hackathon. This paper reports on different collaboration styles and event goals documented at a Spring 2018 female-focused hackathon. Findings include three types of collaboration styles: team-based, cooperative group, and individual participation; as well as four types of event goals: competition, exploration, dabbling, and observing. These findings can inform the collegiate hackathon literature and help hackathons diversify their events by offering insight into ways diverse participants choose to participate at a hackathon and offering design suggestions that mainstream collegiate hackathons can adopt to be more inclusive of different types of students.","Kos, Brittany Ann","hackathon, informal learning, teamwork, women",10.1145/3316287.3316292,2019,4
article,You Hacked and Now What? - Exploring Outcomes of a Corporate Hackathon,"Time bounded events such as hackathons, data dives, codefests, hack-days, sprints or edit-a-thons have increasingly gained attention from practitioners and researchers. Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.","Nolte, Alexander and Pe-Than, Ei Pa Pa and Filippova, Anna and Bird, Christian and Scallen, Steve and Herbsleb, James D.","hackathon, project sustainability, learning, innovation",10.1145/3274398,2018,23
inproceedings,The 2nd Workshop on Hacking and Making at Time-Bounded Events: Current Trends and Next Steps in Research and Event Design,"Hackathons or Hackathon-style events, describe increasingly popular time-bounded intensive events across different fields and sectors. Often cited examples of hackathons include the demanding overnight competitive coding events, but there are many design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims. They offer a new form of collaboration by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and engaging with new audiences. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers, experienced event organizers, and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style events and socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.","Pe Than, Ei Pa Pa and Herbsleb, James and Nolte, Alexander and Gerber, Elizabeth and Fiore-Gartland, Brittany and Chapman, Brad and Moser, Aurelia and Wilkins-Diehr, Nancy","hackathons, radical collocation, time-bounded collaborative events, open-source software, edit-a-thons, codefests, scientific software, sprints, innovation, collaborative learning",10.1145/3170427.3170615,2018,8
inproceedings,The Community Garden Hack: Participatory Experiments in Facilitating Primary School Teacher's Appropriation of Technology,"1As technology increasingly pervades the daily life of teachers and students, finding sustainable ways to successfully integrate innovative technologies in classrooms remains a challenge. This paper reports on our experiences designing and running workshops with (and for) teachers. Collectively, the aims of the workshops were geared ultimately at encouraging teachers to work with technologies in more `designerly' ways in the classroom, i.e. looking at technology as a working material, rather than as an off-the-shelf tool for certain activities, educational content or as an isolated part of the curriculum. We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.","Karimi, Arafeh and Worthy, Peter and McInnes, Paul and Bod\'{e}n, Marie and Matthews, Ben and Viller, Stephen","computational thinking, professional development, participatory design, primary education, makerspace, hackathon",10.1145/3152771.3152787,2017,9

It was organized as an educational and research project to tap into the dynamics of transdisciplinary teams challenged with a specific requirement. In our case, it was to build a Bauhaus-themed German Language Learning VR App. We constructed this experiment to simulate how representatives of different disciplines may work together towards a very specific purpose under time pressure. So, each participating team consisted of members of various expert-fields: software development (Unity or Unreal), design, psychology and linguistics. The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes.

inproceedings,Hackathons in the Formal Learning Process,"Hackathons are short-lived events, typically lasting from 1 to 3 days, where participants gather into groups to tackle a challenge and present a proof of concept in the form of software or hardware prototype, motivated by a common theme. Studies show that learning is one of the primary motivations for people joining hackathons, where situated and collaborative learning take place. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. By taking that into account, we considered bringing hackathons into the classroom. This paper presents a case study of an Internet of Things (IoT) undergraduate course where a hackathon is used as a learning instrument, leveraging on challenge-based learning to motivate students to find and develop a suitable semester project.

We present an explorative, autobiographical case study of a team at a hackathon and in the analysis we identify four factors, which in particular impacted the team's design judgement during the hackathon: 1) The hackathon format, 2) the available tools and materials, 3) the participants' domain knowledge, and 4) the participants' technical knowledge. Though the factors are evident in most design processes, we discuss how the four factors in a hackathon setting influenced the design judgement in a particular way and how the factors influenced the creative engagement in developing technology in the hackathon. We discuss potential implications for future research on how to understand design judgements made under the particular circumstances of a hackathon.","Olesen, Jeanette Falk and Hansen, Nicolai Brodersen and Halskov, Kim","tools and materials, creative process, design process, hackathon",10.1145/3292147.3292155,2018,11

We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena.

article,How to Support Newcomers in Scientific Hackathons - An Action Research Study on Expert Mentoring,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.","Nolte, Alexander and Hayden, Linda Bailey and Herbsleb, James D.","mentoring, hackathon, scientific communities, learning",10.1145/3392830,2020,23
article,Implementation and Evaluation of a Virtual Hackathon in an Urban HSI Community College during COVID-19,"This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.","Azhar, Mohammad Q. and Haynes, Ada and Day, Marisa and Wissinger, Elizabeth",No data,No data,2023,13
inproceedings,"How to Hackathon: Socio-Technical Tradeoffs in Brief, Intensive Collocation","Hackathons are events where people who are not normally collocated converge for a few days to write code together. Hackathons, it seems, are everywhere. We know that long- term collocation helps advance technical work and facilitate enduring interpersonal relationships, but can similar benefits come from brief, hackathon-style collocation? How do participants spend their time preparing, working face-to- face, and following through these brief encounters? Do the activities participants select suggest a tradeoff between the social and technical benefits of collocation? We present results from a multiple-case study that suggest the way that hackathon-style collocation advances technical work varies across technical domain, community structure, and expertise of participants. Building social ties, in contrast, seems relatively constant across hackathons. Results from different hackathon team formation strategies suggest a tradeoff between advancing technical work and building social ties. Our findings have implications for technology support that needs to be in place for hackathons and for understanding the role of brief interludes of collocation in loosely-coupled, geographically distributed work.","Trainer, Erik H. and Kalyanasundaram, Arun and Chaihirunkarn, Chalalai and Herbsleb, James D.","qualitative methods, multiple-case study, collocation, scientific software, Hackathons",10.1145/2818048.2819946,2016,13
inproceedings,Exploring Collaborative Storytelling as a Method for Creating Educational Games,"Designing educational games that meet both learning and entertainment objectives is a challenging task. Games that begin by developing specific educational goals and are later wrapped in a game or narrative context risk appearing forced, while those that begin with gaming elements to which educational elements are added may appear superficial. In this paper, we describe the methodology and results from a three-day interdisciplinary hackathon for developing game narratives designed to address both needs. We present details regarding the hackathon, the collaborative teams, and an example of the outcomes produced.","Wylie, Ruth and Finn, Ed and Eschrich, Joseph and Monsef, Kiyash and Hawkins, Robert","narratives, educational games, interdisciplinary collaboration",10.1145/2724660.2728692,2015,4
article,What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects? Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,"Time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.","Nolte, Alexander and Chounta, Irene-Angelica and Herbsleb, James D.","social computing, project sustainability, project continuation, hackathon",10.1145/3415216,2020,26
inproceedings,"How Gender, Ethnicity, and Public Presentation Shape Coding Perseverance after Hackathons","Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising approach to broadening participation in computer science and engineering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perseverance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engagement in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10 weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engagement when participants present their work to others at the end of events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education and broadening participation in computing by outlining several conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young people.","Gan, Emilia and Menezes, Tyler and Hill, Benjamin Mako","Hackathons, Gender and Diversity, Belonging, Outreach, Inclusiveness, Coding Interest",10.1145/3564721.3564727,2022,11
inproceedings,Engaging Women’s Participation in Hackathons: A Qualitative Study with Participants of a Female-Focused Hackathon,"Hackathons are a sort of application development marathon typically lasting between 24 and 48 hours. They are increasingly becoming an alternative and popular method for fast learning and networking, bringing people together in a short period to do creative projects. However, the number of women participating in such events is extremely low and worrying, and literature lacks empirical evidence about the reasons for that. This qualitative study gathers data and brings a discussion about this topic, as an attempt to understand better why women are not so interested in this type of event.

It was created as part of a rich set of instructional resources designed for teachers of the new AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) course. Yet, App Lab far exceeds the needs of CSP, and would be an appropriate learning environment for students in any CS0/CS1 class, even at the university level. App Lab gives novice programmers access to capabilities previously reserved for courses that require sophisticated tech setup and knowledge of both front and backend web development, server-side scripting, databases, etc.Rather than focusing on curriculum, this workshop will focus on how App Lab works as a programming tool in its own right, and how it was designed to aid and motivate student learning. Participants will get hands-on time with some of App Lab's more advanced features guided by a Code.org product manager, while working with the education team to help understand the educational philosophy that went into its development. Participants will come away with exemplars that highlight App Lab's possibilities, practice with some of its richer features, and do a hackathon to create something to share with each other (and the world)! Finally, we will end with a discussion about how best to integrate App Lab into existing courses.App Lab was developed as part of collaboration between Code.org and David Bau (Google), creator of PencilCode.net.A laptop is required for this session.

article,Socio-Technical Constraints and Affordances of Virtual Collaboration - A Study of Four Online Hackathons,"Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of collaboration in various domains. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which teams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has thus consequently focused on studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the advantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has led to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that participated in 4 hackathon events across two continents. By analyzing the collected data, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based on individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different strategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams that kept open synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio territories), in a sort of ""radical virtual co-location"". However, others, such as interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual collaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how technologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this collaboration.","Mendes, Wendy and Richard, Albert and Tillo, T\""{a}he-Kai and Pinto, Gustavo and Gama, Kiev and Nolte, Alexander","time-bounded collaborative events, online hackathons",10.1145/3555221,2022,32
inproceedings,“Learning from Mistakes is the Best Thing”: Risk and Persistence at Hackathons,"Hackathons are time-bound collaborative computer science competitions increasingly popular at undergraduate institutions. It is often claimed that their failure-friendly environment helps students become better computer scientists. The same features which encourage risk-taking, however, may increase imposter syndrome and stereotype threat. Furthermore, if hackathons really do radically celebrate emergent projects, why do so many participants leave without showcasing their work? This work addresses two research questions: 1) Do students consider hackathons as a space which is safe for taking risks and learning through failure? And 2) How does participants’ perception of risk affect their decisions to persist or quit the main event competition? Extensive mixed methods data was collected from student attendees, professors, and industry sponsors of three undergraduate computer science hackathons. Constructionism was used to understand participant learning through making in a failure-friendly environment, and social cognitive career theory was used to determine how risk affects decisions on continued participation. Results showed participants largely felt that risk was good for learning, although they did worry about their classwork, health, meeting their own standards, and public embarrassment. They felt much more free to take risks than in their CS classes, and wanted 60% of the skills they used to be new. External conflicts or an unfinished project were the reasons that half of participants didn’t submit for judging. As almost 80% of hackathon attendees have CS related majors, these findings have implications for how risks can be productively used for learning both at hackathons and CS classes.","Hardin, Caroline D","Risk-Taking, Constructionism, Hackathon, Failure",10.1145/3488042.3490175,2021,10
article,Hosting Hackathons a Tool in Retaining Students with Beneficial Side Effects,"Research into factors related to retaining students in computing and technology programs has shown that the students sense of community and their personal sense of identity to be factors that matter. To proactively address these issues students and faculty of a Midwestern university came up with the idea of hosting their own hackathon in 2010. In general a hackathon event involves the collaborative development of software projects in a concentrated time period. Having hosted five hackathons we have developed a body of knowledge through experience, which we hope will encourage other schools to hold their own hackathons. This paper describes the issues related to retention in computing and technology programs, some of the factors and decisions that have to be made in hosting a hackathon, and some of the side benefits that hackathons produce.","Munro, David",No data,No data,2015,6

Consequently there is a need to increase the data literacy of computer science students. Data science is a relatively new area within computer science and the curriculum is rapidly evolving along with the tools required to perform analytics which students need to learn how to effectively use. To address the needs of students learning key data science and analytics skills we propose augmenting existing data science curriculums with hackathon events that focus on data also known as datathons. In this paper we present our experience at hosting and running four datathons that involved students and members from the community coming together to solve challenging problems with data from not-for-profit social good organizations and publicly open data. Our reported experience from our datathons will help inform other academics and community groups who also wish to host datathons to help facilitate their students and members to learn key data science and analytics skills.,"Anslow, Craig and Brosz, John and Maurer, Frank and Boyes, Mike","analytics, community engagement, open data, data science, datathon, hackathon",10.1145/2839509.2844568,2016,6

Our work contributes to a growing HCI literature on mental health and wellbeing, as well as understandings of how to imbue appropriate value-sensitivity within the digital design process in these contexts. The first phase of our study was centred upon a hackathon during which teams of designers were asked to conceptualise and prototype digital products or services for those affected by self-harm. We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.","Birbeck, Nataly and Lawson, Shaun and Morrissey, Kellie and Rapley, Tim and Olivier, Patrick","self-harm, mental health and wellbeing, hackathons",10.1145/3025453.3025931,2017,12
inproceedings,Do Hackathon Projects Change the World? An Empirical Analysis of GitHub Repositories,"Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48 hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019 Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85% of commits were made within the first month, and approximately 77% of the total commits occurred within the first week. Only 7% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of commits divided by the length of the development period was only 0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to help increase the average longevity of the development period for projects.","McIntosh, Lukas and Hardin, Caroline D.","informal education, github, hackathons, computer science education",10.1145/3408877.3432435,2021,7

inproceedings,"Collaborative Research into Game Jams, Hackathons and Event-Based Teaching in Higher Education (Abstract Only)","The idea for this session is based on conversations with colleagues from computer science, art, communications, engineering, and biology as well as international colleagues from three continents at ITICSE-2016 on the use of Game Jams to increase participation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in Computer Science and STEM education. High-impact practices are powerful tools in engaging students (NSSE, 2014), perhaps even more so for non-traditional, ESL/ELL, first-generation, and URM students in STEM disciplines by increasing peer and faculty contact, active learning, and high expectations (Goodman). We believe that event-based teaching, such as Game jams and Hackathons provide students with many, if not more of the experiences that are credited with those of commonly identified High Impact Practices (Kuh, 2008).These events also create peer and social networks among participants. While not conclusive - anecdotally the networks of peers and social capacity seem to make a difference in post graduation job search (Mouw). Game Jams and Hackathons are still relatively new in higher education, and while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence as to the benefits reaped by participants of these events, there exists little in the way of long-term studies in the literature that speaks to the academic value of these events.This session will create a conversation among faculty from computer science and other disciplines who are interested in creating these events and their institutions, and developing scholarship to fill in the gaps in the literature around the effects and efficacy of these events on the long-term success of participants.","Pollock, Ian and Brooks, Lonny","stem, collaborative research, hackathons, transdisciplinary practices, high impact practices, event-based teaching, steam, game jams",10.1145/3017680.3022367,2017,1

Understanding Participation in Hackathons Through Program Theory Analysis,"Hackathons are increasingly embraced across diverse sectors as a way of democratizing the design of technology. Several attempts have been made to redefine the format and desired end goal of hackathons in recent years thereby warranting closer methodological scrutiny. In this paper, we apply program theory to analyze the processes and effects of 16 hackathon case studies through published research literature. Building upon existing research on hackathons, our work offers a critical perspective examining the methodological validity of hackathons and exemplifies how specific processes for organizing hackathons are modified for different purposes. Our main contribution is a program theory analysis of hackathon formats that provides an exploration and juxtaposition of 16 case studies in terms of causal relations between the input, process and the effects of hackathons.

article,"""The Personal is Political"": Hackathons as Feminist Consciousness Raising","Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in Feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of ""feminist consciousness raising"" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just ""awareness-raising"", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.","D'Ignazio, Catherine and Michelson, Rebecca and Hope, Alexis and Hoy, Josephine and Roberts, Jennifer and Krontiris, Kate","feminism, hackathons, feminist hci, race, health, gender",10.1145/3415221,2020,23

The study is based on the thematic analysis of ten in-depth interviews with the hackathon organisers. The findings report how trust among the organisers was encapsulated in 1) the shared big goal, 2) the significance of real-life networks, 3) a strong lead organiser on the collaboration forming on the fly, and 4) the lack of face-to-face contact in relation to becoming familiar or staying unknown. Technology related findings showed that the collaboration platforms were selected based on familiarity and ease of use. The chosen communication channels created a split between age groups, and transparency of the communication suffered somewhat from one-to-one communications in the background and divided application use. However, trust between the organisers helped them to overcame the transparency challenges. The findings are applicable to societal crisis situations in which technologies are used to build collaboration in aim to address shared challenges.","Karhu, Mari and Karampela, Maria and H\""{a}kkil\""{a}, Jonna","crisis, COVID-19, pandemic, trust, online collaboration, collaborative technologies, hackathon",10.1145/3543758.3547538,2022,5

inproceedings,Touched by the Hackathon: A Study on the Connection between Hackathon Participants and Start-up Founders,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons, code fests and others have become a global phenomenon. Entrepreneurial hackathons in particular have gained wide spread popularity because they come with the prospect to being the grounds where the next billion dollar enterprise is born. There is however limited insight into whether and how hackathons participants and start-up founders are connected beyond studies on singular events focusing on hackathons as a starting point for start-ups. To address this gap we conducted a study on a dataset covering 44 hackathons over three years and 489 start-ups in the North-Eastern European country of Estonia. Our findings indicate that hackathons are not always the start of an entrepreneurial endeavor but can also be useful through later stages as a means to develop future products, find future employees and others. The results presented in this paper are based on an initial analysis of this rich dataset and thus present the starting point of a larger study on the connection between the hackathon and start-up communities which is currently in planning.","Nolte, Alexander","Start-up, Hackathon, Entrepreneurship",10.1145/3340481.3342735,2019,6
inproceedings,Game Making as a Learning Strategy for Chemical Engineering,"This document introduces the learning approach and projected outcomes of the author's ongoing PhD research, which aims to deliver guidelines for the use of game-based learning techniques, with game making at its core, in chemical engineering education. Since making games requires some technical knowledge that chemical engineering students do not usually possess, the author is developing a custom-made editor to make games intuitively without needing programming skills. Additionally, a game design workshop is included in the learning experience to ease the difficulties of beginners when creating games. All in all, the strategy facilitates hands on sessions that extend traditional education, during which chemical engineering content is approached differently than in a conventional class. Students work in teams, embrace a constructivist learning approach to create an educational game and participate in a hackathon-like event (game jam) to mention some of the features included in this learning experience.","Forn\'{o}s, S\'{\i}lvia","game editor, platform game, chemical engineering, game-based learning, game jams, constructivist education, making games",10.1145/3383668.3419888,2020,3
inproceedings,Curated Pathways to Innovation: Personalized CS Education to Promote Diversity,"The lack of diversity in computing is a well-known issue. This poster is a work-in-progress report on Curated Pathways to Innovation (CPI), a web-based tool which gathers existing online resources for computer science (CS) engagement and learning to allow students to learn more about CS careers and content, with a particular focus on improving participation of K-12 girls and under-represented minorities in CS. This project is a collaboration of people from academia in CS and social science, K-12 education, non-profit, and industry. We are about halfway through a 3-year pilot deployment of CPI with all students in a low-income, primarily Latino/a middle school with nearly 500 students, and smaller deployments have been undertaken and are planned for 2018-19. In addition to online content, we have created in-person experiences, including reverse science fairs, summer camps, and a hackathon, which are tracked in the CPI tool. To measure impact, we conduct regular surveys with the students measuring their interest in CS, self-efficacy, and other metrics. Our evaluation of the system based on survey data has helped inform the development of the system and curriculum, but remains preliminary. This poster also discusses the tool itself. It uses gamification in the form of badges to measure student progress. From the beginning, the vision was to use machine learning to customize recommendations based on students' demographics, background, and past performance. This integration is coming to fruition at the same time we are including more interesting visuals in the UI, such as an avatar and animations.","Linnell, Natalie and Gonsalves, Phil and Kakodkar, Mayank and Martinez, Vanessa and Urdan, Tim and Ribiero, Bruno and Zdankus, Janice","diversity, machine learning, tools",10.1145/3287324.3293845,2019,1
inproceedings,Mapathons and Hackathons to Crowdsource the Generation and Usage of Geographic Data,"Mapathons and hackathons are short-lived events with different purposes. A mapathon is a collaborative effort for collecting geographic data in unmapped areas, while hackathons are focused on application development. Mapathon outputs need to be high quality to be reusable, but often, when applications are later built on top of map data, there is a mismatch between data collected and application requirements. We conducted an international collaboration project aiming to address this situation by creating a circular process where geographic information is collected in a mapathon and later used in a hackathon. Based on user feedback this cycle can be repeated so the collected data and developed applications can be improved. In this event report, we describe the two mapathon-hackathon cycles that were part of our pilot to validate that process. We present their outcomes and some lessons learned. We focused on the so-called ""blue economy"" (i.e. the sustainable use of marine and ocean resources for economic growth and improved livelihoods in coastal areas.) as the target domain for this pilot. Data for carefully selected areas of the South African coast was collected through in mapathons and later use in hackathons. The mapathons were held in South Africa, and the hackathons took place in Brazil.","Gama, Kiev and Rautenbach, Victoria and Green, Cameron and Gon\c{c}alves, Breno Alencar and Coetzee, Serena and Fourie, Nicolene and Sastry, Nishanth","Mapathon, Volunteer Geographic Information, Hackathon",10.1145/3316287.3316293,2019,5
inproceedings,The Comfort of Distance: Student Choices and Soft Skill Development during a Hybrid Hackathon in Post-Pandemic Learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional educational methods, forcing a quick transition to emergency remote learning. With the subsequent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, universities and society as a whole gradually resumed in-person activities. Students and university staff had to readjust to on-site learning and its associated challenges. This experience report specifically focuses on a course at University [omitted] dedicated to the design and development of Distributed Applications. Students engaged in a hybrid hackathon – an activity blending in-person and remote work – as part of the course. Despite their preferences for in-person collaboration, the majority of the students opted for remote participation. The goal of this report is to understand the students’ choices and adaptations to this new post-pandemic educational setting. We collected data through an anonymous survey and group interviews, revealing that the preference for remote work stemmed from convenience. Despite this, the distant collaboration allowed students to develop various soft skills. This exploration can shed light on future educational approaches in a world where online and in-person interactions can coexist.","Gama, Kiev and Zimmerle, Carlos and Paganini, Lavinia","soft skills, hybrid learning, distant collaboration, collaborative learning, hackathons",10.1145/3613372.3614201,2023,10

This is a competition concept that can be used in place of or to prepare for a traditional hackathon. This style of competition is more friendly to first and second year students, less competitive, less of a time commitment, and more collaborative. Two different competition formats are presented. The first is called ""Problem Solving Speed Dating"", which works by pairing upperclassmen and underclassmen in a speed dating type exercise. The second is called ""Unwrapped Collaborative Problem Solving"", where students work on a team but with very specific (and intentionally restrictive) roles. Both competition formats were tested in five different workshops over the course of several years involving around 250 undergraduate students.

inproceedings,10 Years of Research With and On Hackathons,"Hackathon formats have been praised for their potential for promoting innovative thinking and making in a short time-frame. For this reason, hackathons have also been embraced by many researchers who use hackathons as part of their research in various ways. Through an extensive review of 381 publications published during a 10 year time span, we document the multiple ways in which hackathons are embraced and used by researchers The paper contributes to a better understanding of hackathons as part of research by providing a broad overview as a resource for researchers. We identify three main motivations for using hackathons as part of research: 1) Structuring learning, 2) structuring processes, and 3) enabling participation. For each of the motivations, we identify research with hackathons, and research on hackathons as two main categories. Drawing on several examples from the review we discuss benefits and challenges of using hackathons as part of research.","Falk Olesen, Jeanette and Halskov, Kim","hackathons, research method, literature review",10.1145/3357236.3395543,2020,16
inproceedings,"Experience Report: Thinkathon -- Countering an ""I Got It Working"" Mentality with Pencil-and-Paper Exercises","Goal-directed problem-solving labs can lead a student to believe that the most important achievement in a first programming course is to get programs working. This is counter to research indicating that code comprehension is an important developmental step for novice programmers. We observed this in our own CS-0 introductory programming course, and furthermore, that students weren't making the connection between code comprehension in labs and a final examination that required solutions to pencil-and-paper comprehension and writing exercises, where sound understanding of programming concepts is essential. Realising these deficiencies late in our course, we put on three 3-hour optional revision evenings just days before the exam. Based on a mastery learning philosophy, students were expected to work through a bank of around 200 pencil-and-paper exercises. By comparison with a machine-based hackathon, we called this a Thinkathon. Students completed a pre and post questionnaire about their experience of the Thinkathon. While we find that Thinkathon attendance positively influences final grades, we believe our reflection on the overall experience is of greater value. We report that: respected methods for developing code comprehension may not be enough on their own; novices must exercise their developing skills away from machines; and there are social learning outcomes in programming courses, currently implicit, that we should make explicit.","Cutts, Quintin and Barr, Matthew and Bikanga Ada, Mireilla and Donaldson, Peter and Draper, Steve and Parkinson, Jack and Singer, Jeremy and Sundin, Lovisa","introductory programming, mastery learning, program comprehension, goal-directed problem solving",10.1145/3304221.3319785,2019,7

We show that high accuracy results can be obtained using the transfer learning technique combined with a well fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network. Moreover, we seek for not only smaller deep learning architectures with less trainable parameters to reduce the training and inference time of AI applications for mobile and edge devices, but also relatively high performance.

inproceedings,Short Datathon for the Interdisciplinary Development of Data Analysis and Visualization Skills,"Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests, Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper, we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University of Technology - Paran\'{a}. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.","Salinas, Myrian Noguera and Emer, Maria Claudia Figueiredo Pereira and Neto, Adolfo Gustavo Serra Seca","data analysis, data visualization, international fraud, datathon",10.1109/CHASE.2019.00031,2019,4

inproceedings,ShareInsights: An Unified Approach to Full-Stack Data Processing,"The field of data analysis seeks to extract value from data for either business or scientific benefit. This field has seen a renewed interest with the advent of big data technologies and a new organizational role called data scientist. Even with the new found focus, the task of analyzing large amounts of data is still challenging and time-consuming.The essence of data analysis involves setting up data pipe-lines which consists of several operations that are chained together - starting from data collection, data quality checks, data integration, data analysis and data visualization (including the setting up of interaction paths in that visualization).In our opinion, the challenges stem from from the technology diversity at each stage of the data pipeline as well as the lack of process around the analysis.In this paper we present a platform that aims to significantly reduce the time it takes to build data pipelines. The platform attempts to achieve this in following ways. Allow the user to describe the entire data pipeline with a single language and idioms - all the way from data ingestion to insight expression (via visualization and end-user interaction).Provide a rich library of parts that allow users to quickly assemble a data analysis pipeline in the language.Allow for a collaboration model that allows multiple users to work together on a data analysis pipeline as well as leverage and extend prior work with minimal effort.We studied the efficacy of the platform for a data hackathon competition conducted in our organization. The hackathon provided us with a way to study the impact of the approach. Rich data pipelines which traditionally took weeks to build were constructed and deployed in hours. Consequently, we believe that the complexity of designing and running the data analysis pipeline can be significantly reduced; leading to a marked improvement in the productivity of data analysts/data scientists.","Deshpande, Mukund and Ray, Dhruva and Dixit, Sameer and Agasti, Avadhoot","data visualization, data pipeline, big data, data analysis",10.1145/2723372.2742800,2015,16

Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.","Plant, Nicola and Hilton, Clarice and Gillies, Marco and Fiebrink, Rebecca and Perry, Phoenix and Gonz\'{a}lez D\'{\i}az, Carlos and Gibson, Ruth and Martelli, Bruno and Zbyszynski, Michael","movement interaction, performance, interactive machine learning, immersive media",10.1145/3430524.3442703,2021,5

inproceedings,Hackathons in Software Engineering Education: Lessons Learned from a Decade of Events,"Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops.

inproceedings,Data Programming with DDLite: Putting Humans in a Different Part of the Loop,"Populating large-scale structured databases from unstructured sources is a critical and challenging task in data analytics. As automated feature engineering methods grow increasingly prevalent, constructing sufficiently large labeled training sets has become the primary hurdle in building machine learning information extraction systems. In light of this, we have taken a new approach called data programming [7]. Rather than hand-labeling data, in the data programming paradigm, users generate large amounts of noisy training labels by programmatically encoding domain heuristics as simple rules. Using this approach over more traditional distant supervision methods and fully supervised approaches using labeled data, we have been able to construct knowledge base systems more rapidly and with higher quality. Since the ability to quickly prototype, evaluate, and debug these rules is a key component of this paradigm, we introduce DDLite, an interactive development framework for data programming. This paper reports feedback collected from DDLite users across a diverse set of entity extraction tasks. We share observations from several DDLite hackathons in which 10 biomedical researchers prototyped information extraction pipelines for chemicals, diseases, and anatomical named entities. Initial results were promising, with the disease tagging team obtaining an F1 score within 10 points of the state-of-the-art in only a single day-long hackathon's work. Our key insights concern the challenges of writing diverse rule sets for generating labels, and exploring training data. These findings motivate several areas of active data programming research.","Ehrenberg, Henry R. and Shin, Jaeho and Ratner, Alexander J. and Fries, Jason A. and R\'{e}, Christopher",No data,10.1145/2939502.2939515,2016,6

inproceedings,Songle Sync: A Large-Scale Web-Based Platform for Controlling Various Devices in Synchronization with Music,"This paper presents Songle Sync, a web-based platform on which hundreds of Internet-connected devices - including smartphones, computers, and other physical computing devices - can be controlled to synchronize with music playback. It uses music-understanding technologies to dynamically synthesize music-driven multimedia performances from a musical piece of choice. To simultaneously control hundreds of devices, a conventional architecture keeps always-on connections between them. However, it does not scale and suffers from latency and jitter issues when there are various devices with potentially unstable networks. We address this with a novel autonomous control architecture in which each device is notified of forthcoming musical events (e.g., beats and chorus sections) to automatically drive various changes in multimedia performances. Moreover, we provide a development kit of an event-driven multimedia framework for JavaScript, example programs, and an interactive tutorial. To evaluate the platform, we compared latencies, jitters, and amounts of network traffic between ours and the conventional architecture. To examine use cases in the wild, we deployed the platform to drive over a hundred of a variety of devices. We also developed a web browser-based application for a multimedia performance with music playback. It provided audiences of hundreds with a bring-your-own-device experience of synchronized animations on smartphones. In addition, the development kit was used in a two-day hackathon.

inproceedings,Global Gov Jam: Motivational Aspects of Participants,"Open innovation initiatives aimed at building and proposing service improvements for the Government increasingly include activities of programming marathons for Apps (hackathons), ideation and prototype challenges as different ways to stimulate civic engagement. In this scenario is the Global Gov Jam, a 48-hour event that happens simultaneously in several cities around the world, aiming to involve government people together with citizens to propose innovative ideas for solving governmental problems. This work investigates what are the main motivational aspects of factors that lead people to engage in Global Gov Jam and what are the correlations among those factors. The method used was the replication of a survey applied previously to participants of civic hackathon events, with some adaptations motivated by the characteristics of the type of event we studied. The results show that ""thinking outside the box"", which gives the possibility of producing innovation without the conventional limitations, is the most significant motivational aspect for participating in this event. Evidence points to the similarity of the main motivational factors, among the results found in the original research on hackathons and this work. We also demonstrate through empirical evidence that there is correlation among motivational factors related to social interactions, such as visibility among peers, performing teamwork, and networking.","Alencar, Breno and Gama, Kiev","Global Gov Jam, Service Design, Prototyping",10.1145/3196697.3196701,2018,8

The number of cases has been rapidly growing since then. Molecular and antigen testing methods are very accurate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply. Because the virus affects an infected patient’s lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis. However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited. Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required. We describe a system for automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images. It first segmented images to select only the lung. The segmented part was then fed into a multiclass classification module, which worked well with samples obtained from various sources, which had different aspect ratios, contrast and viewpoints. The system also handled the unbalanced dataset—only a small fraction of images showed COVID-19. Our system achieved 92% of F1-score and 88.1% Marco F1-score on the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School Hackathon Phase 3—Multi-class COVID-19 Chest X-ray challenge public leaderboard.","Kittiworapanya, Phongsathorn and Pasupa, Kitsuchart","Imbalanced Data, Coronavirus, Computer Vision, COVID-19, Neural Networks",10.1145/3429210.3429227,2020,7
proceedings,CIKM '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,"Since 1992, the ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) has brought together leading researchers and developers from the knowledge management, information retrieval, and data management communities to discuss cutting-edge research on advanced knowledge and information systems. We are pleased to present the 26th edition of CIKM on 6-10 November, 2017, at the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel, with the special theme of Smart Cities, Smart Nations. This year our attendees will enjoy four keynote speakers: Rajeev Rastogi (Amazon), Qiang Yang (HKUST), Rada Mihalcea (Michigan), and K Ananth Krishnan (Tata Consultancy Services). In 6-7 parallel sessions, our program includes presentations of 171 full research papers, 119 short research papers, and 30 demonstrations of new research advances. The program's focus this year can be seen at a glance in the word cloud at right, constructed from the titles of all accepted research papers. Also on offer are eight tutorials on timely research topics, and six collocated workshops on topics ranging from history to transportation, biomedicine to bias.We are excited about our greatly expanded data analytics competition this year, the CIKM AnalytiCup. During the past nine months, over 1500 teams from all over the world have vied to win over $60,000 in AnalytiCup prizes and travel money by solving real-world analytics problems posed by our corporate sponsors Alibaba/Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau, DataSpark, and Lazada. A fourth competition, a weekend-long hackathon sponsored by DHL, takes place immediately before the conference. The finalists from all four competitions come together on 6 November for a final showdown in front of corporate judges. Solution summaries from finalist teams in the first three competitions can be found in these proceedings. Also new this year are several other events aimed directly at practitioners. During the main conference, we are offering hands-on tutorials on the hot topics of scalable deep learning and scalable data science. The Case Studies track, intended to highlight the experiences and lessons learned by early adopters, debuts this year with 23 studies of technology adoption in interesting applications. And immediately before the main conference, CIKMconnect brings together students and industry for posters, technical discussions, recruiting events, and networking. It takes a village to produce a major conference! Our program committee chairs, senior PC and PC members valiantly and gracefully handled a record total number of submissions: 855 full research papers, 419 short research papers, 80 demos, and 103 case studies.

inproceedings,CodeTimeline: Storytelling with Versioning Data,"Working with a software system typically requires knowledge of the system's history, however this knowledge is often only tribal memory of the development team. In past user studies we have observed that when being presented with collaboration views and word clouds from the system's history engineers start sharing memories linked to those visualizations. In this paper we propose an approach based on a story-telling visualization, which is designed to entice engineers to share and document their tribal memory. Sticky notes can be used to share memories of a system's lifetime events, such as past design rationales but also more casual memories like pictures from after-work beer or a hackathon. We present an early-stage prototype implementation and include two design studies created using that prototype.","Kuhn, Adrian and Stocker, Mirko",No data,No data,2012,4
article,Exploring Participants’ Representations and Shifting Sensitivities in a Hackathon for Dementia,"Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in representing and involving people with dementia in these events, which had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis presents insights into participants’ motivations, challenges participants faced when constructing their “absent user”, and the design features teams developed to address the social context of the user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for collaborative design events, community building through design, and reification in design.","Hodge, James and Foley, Sarah and Lambton-Howard, Dan and Booi, Laura and Montague, Kyle and Coulter, Sandra and Kirk, David and Morrissey, Kellie","hackathon, social, Dementia, care, virtual reality, community",10.1145/3571814,2023,35

inproceedings,Enabling Peer-Led Coding Camps by Creating a Seed Effect in Young Students,"During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.","Fronza, Ilenia and Corral, Luis and Iaccarino, Gennaro and Pahl, Claus","peer-assisted learning, computational thinking, coding camp",10.1145/3450329.3476860,2021,6
inproceedings,An Empirical Study of the Characteristics of Popular Game Jams and Their High-Ranking Submissions on Itch.Io,"Game jams are hackathon-like events that allow participants to develop a playable game prototype within a time limit. They foster creativity and the exchange of ideas by letting developers with different skill sets collaborate. Having a high-ranking game is a great bonus to a beginning game developer’s r\'{e}sum\'{e} and their pursuit of a career in the game industry. However, participants often face time constraints set by jam hosts while balancing what aspects of their games should be emphasized to have the highest chance of winning. Similarly, hosts need to understand what to emphasize when organizing online jams so that their jams are more popular, in terms of submission rate. In this paper, we study 1,290 past game jams and their 3,752 submissions on itch.io to understand better what makes popular jams and high-ranking games perceived well by the audience. We find that a quality description has a positive contribution to both a jam’s popularity and a game’s ranking. Additionally, more manpower organizing a jam or developing a game increases a jam’s popularity and a game’s high-ranking likelihood. High-ranking games tend to support Windows or macOS, and belong to the “Puzzle”, “Platformer”, “Interactive Fiction”, or “Action” genres. Also, shorter competitive jams tend to be more popular. Based on our findings, we suggest jam hosts and participants improve the description of their products and consider co-organizing or co-participating in a jam. Furthermore, jam participants should develop multi-platform multi-genre games. Finally, jam hosts should introduce a tighter time limit to increase their jam’s popularity.","Vu, Quang N. and Bezemer, Cor-Paul","mining software repositories, game jams, itch.io, empirical software engineering, game development",10.1145/3402942.3402981,2020,11
inproceedings,MUDAMOS: A Civil Society Initiative on Collaborative Lawmaking in Brazil,"Brazil's Constitution instituted a few means of direct democracy including the possibility of any citizen to propose a draft bill at a legislative house at the municipal, state or federal level, given the support of a minimum of citizens explicit through their signature. Until today, popular initiative bills' signatures are paper-based, which is not only costly, but also presents problems connected to transparency and safety principles. The Institute for Technology and Society of Rio believed that technology could transform this process and, hence, developed a mobile app called ""Mudamos"" (""we change"" in Portuguese) to prove that it is possible to sign bills of popular initiative electronically. Since the launch of the app Mudamos in March 2017, we have observed that the population has a lot of will to participate and good ideas to propose. However, despite this potential for engagement, citizens experience difficulty when transforming those ideas into draft bills to be presented to legislative houses. Therefore, we have developed ""Virada Legislativa"" (legal hackathon): a methodology comprising an activity to develop draft bills collectively addressing a single issue and within a timeframe. In this article, we aim to showcase this toolbox for democratic participation, connecting cutting-edge digital innovations on electronic signatures (online) with social innovative methodologies (offline), highlighting the impact we have had throughout this period as well as the challenges faced, and lessons learned.","Konopacki, Marco and Albu, Debora and Steibel, Fabro","Civic Technology, Cryptography, Deliberative Democracy, CrowdLaw, Participatory Democracy, Crowdsourcing",10.1145/3326365.3326388,2019,6

article,Makers and Quilters: Investigating Opportunities for Improving Gender-Imbalanced Maker Groups,"Recent efforts to diversify participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math) activities through informal learning environments, such as hackathons and makerspaces, confirm a real desire for inclusion among potential female participants. However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space.","MacArthur, Cayley and Wong, Caroline and Hancock, Mark","makerspaces, craft, making, quilting, game jams, feminism, game development, thematic analysis, gender",10.1145/3359131,2019,24
inproceedings,A Context-Aware Browser Extension for Just-in-Time Learning of Data Literacy Skills,"Data was a topic previously reserved for expert computer scientists. However, the general public now uses data and visualizations to form opinions and make decisions that affect their lives, such as their health (e.g.: vaccines) and their political opinions (e.g.: gentrification). Unfortunately, few have access to the formal data literacy training required to analyze this data effectively [9]. Existing approaches to provide informal CS education include hackathons [8, 10], after school programs [1], and online tutorials [5]. However, these learning opportunities are often decontextualized from a learner's daily life and require them to go out of their way to learn. Our research investigates techniques to integrate informal learning opportunities seamlessly into people's everyday lives. Prior research in just-in-time learning shows how heuristics can be used in deterministic settings to provide explanations for code [3] and math equations [4]. However, this is challenging when there is no single correct way to interpret and explain content, such as in visualizations. We present Expert Goggles, a browser extension that automatically detects visualizations that people encounter on the web and provides just-in-time, contextually-relevant training modules to scaffold learning and interpretation.","MacNeil, Stephen and Withka, Joshua and Wile, Aaron and Patel, Parth and Jao, Emily and Hanley, Margaret",No data,10.1145/3501709.3544281,2022,2

Each year, around 20 first-year undergraduate women who intend to major in computer science (CS) apply and are selected to participate. LLC participants live in a common residence hall and are provided with an educational, mentoring, and community-building program that supports their progress as students and CS majors. Participants take a ""house course,"" Great Ideas and Insights in Computer Science, as a group, and also take a course on Knowledge and Power: Issues in Women's Leadership. Program activities include study sessions and industry interactions, as well as opportunities to participate in K-12 outreach programs, hackathons, and computing research. To evaluate the program, participants and a similar comparison group are surveyed at the beginning and end of the academic year and a focus group is conducted with program participants.

inproceedings,Enhancing Data Education with Datathons: An Experience with Open Data on Renewable Energy Systems,"Data literacy and the fundamentals of big data management are becoming interdisciplinary in Higher Education curricula, also due to the widespread need of data science skills. This casts the need for presenting novel (and more engaging) learning activities to students. Data hackathons (also known as datathons) represent a viable option to allow students practicing with real use cases and datasets, as well as addressing their learning experiences collaboratively. Moreover, datathons promise to improve soft skills and offer hands-on learning opportunities. Therefore, we present in this paper a datathon on a publicly available dataset about renewable energy systems. The datathon involved students from three data-focused courses of three different M.S. degrees at the University of Salento (Italy). A detailed analysis of the design, implementation and evaluation choices is proposed, along with a series of gathered insights and lessons learned that might help systematizing the introduction and use of datathons in data education.","Longo, Antonella and Zappatore, Marco and Martella, Angelo and Rucco, Chiara","data education curricula, renewable energy systems, open data, datathon",10.1145/3531072.3535322,2022,6
inproceedings,Everybody's Hacking: Participation and the Mainstreaming of Hackathons,"Hackathons have become a popular tool for bringing people together to imagine new possibilities for technology. Despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. This mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. Given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in HCI can learn. Through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. In doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research.","Taylor, Nick and Clarke, Loraine","innovation, participatory design, jams, co-design, hackathons, making",10.1145/3173574.3173746,2018,12

Bologna itself has a rich history going back at least 3,000 years, and among other things boasts a well-preserved historical town center, many porticoes and towers. The city is ranked at the top on the list of Italian cities in terms of quality of life and quality of food.The conference continues to be a truly international conference with 241 submissions with a total of 554 authors from 40 countries on all continents: the authors came from Africa (5), Asia (33), Europe (232), the Middle East (11), North America including Central America and the Caribbean (189), Oceania (34), and South America (50). In total, a total of 175 papers, one panel, and 16 working groups were submitted. Additionally, there were 31 posters and 18 tips &amp; techniques submissions.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least six reviewers. This year, 56 papers (32%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. All posters and tips &amp; techniques submissions were also reviewed by two reviewers. 24 posters and nine Tips and Techniques submissions were accepted.The nine accepted working groups will address a diverse section of topics, including student engagement, game development, integrating international students, assessment development, code quality perceptions, a holistic understanding through research papers, effects of lecturer intervention on student behaviour, the Internet of Things and early developmental activities leading to computational thinking skills. Participating in a working group is probably one of the most efficient ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. It provides participants a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group.This conference will have two keynote speakers.

inproceedings,Community Code Engagements: Summer of Code &amp; Hackathons for Community Building in Scientific Software,"Community code engagements -- short-term, intensive software development events -- are used by some scientific communities to create new software features and promote community building. But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceived by the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.","Trainer, Erik H. and Chaihirunkarn, Chalalai and Kalyanasundaram, Arun and Herbsleb, James D.","scientific software, google summer of code (gsoc), hackathons, community code engagements",10.1145/2660398.2660420,2014,11

Originally designed for programmers, hackathons are now being appropriated by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons, we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these events. We conducted an interview study with 22 stakeholders - participants, representatives of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop.

inproceedings,Going Beyond The Challenge! Investigating The Aspects That Attract People to Participate in Hackathons,"Hackathons are events where their participants face the challenge of working intensively and collaboratively with other people. In these events, the participants have the opportunity to develop functional prototypes and solutions to real problems in a short time period (one to three days). Those kind of events have become increasingly popular and spread to several fields of knowledge. Also, they have been adopted by many organizations over the world. However, there is little scientific data that explains why people have participated in hackathons. In this paper, we report findings from an exploratory study in two hackathons organized by a big IT company. We aim to understand why their participants have voluntarily participated in such events. We identified four sets of motivational factors: technical, social, individual and business motivations. Technical motivations are associated with skill acquisition, while social motivations are related to the interaction between people during the event. Also, individual motivations are associated with a sense of autonomy and enjoyment of work. Finally, business motivations include the opportunity of publicizing work and the possibility of establishing partnerships. Our findings contributes to a broader understanding of the motivations for participating in hackathons, as well as providing recommendations for the organization of such events.","de Almeida Melo, Leandro and da Silva Junior, F\'{a}bio Freire and Leite, Tiago Henrique da S. and Filho, Fernando Figueira and de Souza, Cleidson R.

While hackathons, that is, competitive overnight coding events, are one of the more prevalent examples of this phenomenon, there are many more distinct event design variations for different audiences and with divergent aims, such as sprints, codefests, hack-days, edit-a-thons and so on. Taken together, these events offer new opportunities and challenges for cooperative work by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for interdependent work and access to new audiences of collaborators. This one-day workshop brings together researchers interested in the phenomenon, experienced event organizers, and participants interested in running their own events to consolidate research to-date, share practical experiences, and understand what benefits different event variations may offer, how they may be applied in other contexts, and how insights from studying these events may contribute to CSCW knowledge.","Filippova, Anna and Chapman, Brad and Geiger, R.

However, current approaches for facilitating small group interactions typically do not capture data about the rapport and future potential of interacting groups. We introduce ProtoTeams, a system designed to facilitate and gather data from small group interactions by dynamically connecting people from larger co-located crowds, such as classrooms and hackathons, through personal mobile devices. The system randomly assigns subjects into groups, then guides them through short activities, at the end of which they evaluate their teammate preferences. We report preliminary results from three deployments in a university-level design studio course where students (N = 50) interact with peers on activities before forming teams for a quarter-long project. Results suggest that the system is intuitive and groups form efficiently. Few subjects report the environment being too hectic and activities too short to accurately evaluate their peers.

inproceedings,An Experience Report on the Adoption of Microservices in Three Brazilian Government Institutions,"Although monolithic applications are still the modus operandi of many software systems, the microservices architecture, which favors small and independent applications, is gaining increasing popularity. This is part due to its claimed benefits, which includes better scalability, productivity, and maintainability. However, little is known about how developers and architects perceive the benefits of migrating from monolithic applications to microservices, and what are the challenges towards achieving them. In this paper we discuss the motivation, benefits, and challenges related to the migration from monolithic enterprise architectures to a microservices based architecture. We report several lessons learned that arose from a two years process faced by three Brazilian Government Institutions. We also cross-validate these findings with a survey conducted with 13 practitioners in the studied companies. The results of our investigation highlight some evidence that the adoption of microservices brought several benefits for these institutions, such as (a) reducing development time and risks related to deployment activities and (b) increasing the opportunities to experiment with different technologies and development models (such as hackathons). However, our observations reveal that the adoption of microservices is still a challenging task, mainly because it not only demands the understanding of new techniques and tools, but it also increases the need to automate tasks related to software deployment and software monitoring. This study is particularly relevant for institutions interested in adopting a software architecture based on microservices, and we are currently sharing our experiences with other institutions.","Luz, Welder and Agilar, Everton and de Oliveira, Marcos C\'{e}sar and de Melo, Carlos Eduardo R. and Pinto, Gustavo and Bonif\'{a}cio, Rodrigo","monolithic applications, microservice applications, experience report, lessons learned",10.1145/3266237.3266262,2018,10

This team can be seen in companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, with a business model based on software ecosystems (SECO). A DevRel team has roles that perform specific activities (e.g., hackathons, developer programs) to achieve the organization’s goals and a better developer experience. Problem: The lack of clarity regarding the nature and set of skills needed by a DevRel professional can negatively impact the performance of related activities and consequently the purpose of SECO. Solution: We investigated a set of DevRel skills for education/training purposes. IS theory: This paper was generated from the perspective of the Theory of Organizational Creativity. This theory provides the key to understanding organizational effectiveness and survival. Method: We performed an opinion survey with 24 participants from ten countries. Results: The nature of DevRel’s professional skills is soft skills in which communication, willingness to learn, teamwork, interpersonal, and listening skills stand out. Hard skills have their share of contribution to DevRel activities and marketing and software programming/development skills stand out. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The main contribution of the paper is to make a product viable for any organization or individual to be able to develop the skills of a DevRel professional.

inproceedings,Integration of Practical Computing Skills and Co-Curricular Activities in the Curriculum,"Participation in co-curricular activities, such as hackathons, coding clubs, and undergraduate research has been shown to have a positive impact on the retention, persistence, and sense of belonging of students in the Computer Science (CS) field. In this paper, we will present the result of a study to assess the impact of integrating co-curricular activities and practical skills into the undergraduate CS curriculum. More than 500 senior CS students were surveyed over a span of four semesters about their comfort level, use of practical skills, and their experience in a sophomore-level required course which was redesigned a few years ago. The new course introduced practical skills such as version control, SQL, command line tools, and web development as a way to better engage the students and prepare them for co-curricular computing experiences. Our data analysis provides insight about when and where students use practical skills, how students feel about co-curricular activities, and the positive impact of the course redesign on the overall student experience.","Hooshangi, Sara and Buxton, Ryan and Ellis, Margaret","problem-solving skills, comfort level, co-curricular activities",10.1145/3502718.3524802,2022,7

inproceedings,"Software Engineering for 'Social Good': Integrating Action Research, Participatory Design, and Agile Development","Software engineering for ‘social good’ is an area receiving growing interest in recent years. Software is increasingly seen as a way to promote positive social change: this includes initiatives such as Code for America and events such as hackathons, which strive to build innovative software solutions with a social conscience. From a software engineering perspective, existing software processes do not always match the needs of these social software projects, which are primarily aimed at social change and often involve vulnerable communities. In this paper, we argue for new software processes that combine elements of agile, iterative development with principles drawn from action research and participatory design. The former allow social software projects to be built quickly with limited resources; the latter allow for a proper understanding of the social context and vulnerable user groups. The paper describes Speedplay, a software development management framework integrating these approaches, and illustrates its use in a real social innovation case study.","Ferrario, Maria Angela and Simm, Will and Newman, Peter and Forshaw, Stephen and Whittle, Jon","socially conscious software, agile methods, action research",10.1145/2591062.2591121,2014,4
inproceedings,Hybrid Events in Education,Digital tools and streaming media enable new ways of including experts and peers from outside the university. In this paper we present three patterns that build on events that take place both on and off campus. The idea behind the patterns is to encourage discussion among students on-site and reach out to experts that would not be available otherwise. Inverted conferences are conference like settings on campus but the actual speakers are streamed from somewhere else. TED evenings or TED sessions are educational setups where docents are integrating TED talks into the course. And hackathons are events on campus that encourage students to tinker with technology and hack existing products in positive ways.,"Kohls, Christian",No data,10.1145/3551902.3551976,2023,7
inproceedings,Understanding CS Undergraduate Students' Professional Identity through the Lens of Their Professional Development,"Academic institutions play a crucial role in the development of students' professional identities. However, we have limited knowledge of how computing professional identity develops. This paper aims to understand how CS undergraduate students develop their professional identity through analyzing students' reflection on their career goals, experiences in CS degree programs, and engagement in professional development. We present findings from qualitative analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with CS undergraduate students in the United States. We found that CS undergraduates form their computing professional identity typically between Years 2-3 of their degree programs. We identified several reasons students are committed to a computing profession: intrinsic factors (e.g., interest and perception of ability), and discipline-specific factors (e.g. utility and growth). We also found several factors that shape their professional identity: coursework, informal activities like hackathons, and professional development activities including internships and conferences. These findings suggest that the development of computing professional identity is not limited to students' involvement in the academic degree programs but the engagement they have with the broader computing community.","Kapoor, Amanpreet and Gardner-McCune, Christina","professional identity, identity, career choices, professional development",10.1145/3304221.3319764,2019,7

SWEETER offers CI support to foster research collaborations at several minority serving institutions in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Its training programs and student mentorship have supported participants, with several taking CI professional positions at research computing facilities. In this paper, we discuss the structure of the CyberTeam and the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on its activities. The SWEETER CyberTeam has a hub-and-spoke structure that adopted a federated approach to ensure that each site maintained its own identity and was able to leverage local programs. It took a ”boots on the ground” approach that ensured that services were up and running in a short period of time. To ensure adequate coverage of all fields of science, the project adopted an inclusive fractional service approach that leveraged expertise at the participating sites. The Cyberteam has organized several workshops, hackathons, and training events. Team members have participated in completions and several follow-on programs have been funded.

inproceedings,The Effectiveness of Collaboration Using the Hackathon to Promote Computer Programming Skills,A model learning environment for a 21st-century Information Technology (IT) graduate comprises of both technical and soft skills. New trends are emerging on how to develop this technical and soft skills. Collaborative learning and social cognitive theory were adopted as a theoretical foundation for this study as limited studies have been done to find out which frameworks has been consistent to determine students' computer programming experience using the Hackathon. This paper aim to evaluate the effectiveness of collaboration in a Hackathon environment to learn Computer Programming (CP) among IT students. The objectives of the study are: (i) to examine the influence of collaboration on students' CP skills (ii) to examine the influence of Hackathon on students' computer programming skills (iii) to study the statistical association between collaborative learning and Hackathon on students' CP skills. 80 students participated in this study through a survey method and the responses was analyzed using SPSS software. The results of the study indicate that students were satisfied with their collaborative learning experience and believed that the Hackathon approach will help them in developing computer programming technical and soft skill. This study develops a model and contributes to empirical studies on Hackathon as most studies in this field are based on anecdotal findings.,"Mhlongo, Sakhumuzi and Oyetade, Kayode Emmanuel and Zuva, Tranos",,10.1109/IMITEC50163.2020.9334089,2020,6
inproceedings,Tracking Hackathon Code Creation and Reuse,"Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon. Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from Devpost– a hackathon database – and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before determining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this amount is still significant considering time and member constraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.","Imam, Ahmed and Dey, Tapajit",,10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00085,2021,3
article,Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease Outbreaks Through Hackathons,"Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.","Pakpour, Nazzy and Nouredini, Sahar and Tandon, James",,10.1109/TE.2022.3159150,2022,9
inproceedings,Effectiveness of Hackathons in Software Engineering Education,"This Research Full Paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of hackathons in Software Engineering Education. Hackathons have become a growing part of Software Engineering (SE) education in the past decade. Although the academic environment develops technical foundations, a hackathon can develop key competencies to hone lifelong learning. Improving interpersonal, entrepreneurial, and technical skills better prepare SE students for a career after graduation and reinforces engineering-relevant skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and management. This study examines students’ abilities to transfer relevant course skills into the hackathon environment, specifically those related to SE best practices such as software design, SOLID principles (Single-responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion Principle), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Furthermore, through faculty-led hackathon prep sessions and workshops, students are trained to follow an adapted design-thinking process known as the Hackathon Design Thinking Process (HDTP). This study directly addresses the following sub-questions: to what extent do participants feel that hackathons have a positive impact on their SE education, what are the participants’ perceptions of SOLID principles and OOP skill development during the hackathon, and how effectively are participants able to apple SOLID principles and OOP practices during the hackathon? The data is aggregated from a second-year SE undergraduate and a first-year SE masters cohort from participant perception surveys, judges, and project submissions from two hackathons. We utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Google’s Sentiment Analysis, conduct Kendall’s Tau-b Test using IBM’s SPSS Statistics Tool, and compare Class Diagrams with student-submitted code. Results confirm that participants believe hackathons positively impact their education and tend to sacrifice planning time to implement solutions, often disobeying SE design principles and best practices due to the fast-paced nature of hackathons.","Haque, Risat and Salmani, Ali and Raessinejad, Niyousha and Moshirpour, Mohammad",,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962527,2022,8
inproceedings,A Hackathon Methodology for Undergraduate Course Projects,"In this innovative practice full paper we present a methodology for organizing a hackathon as a learning instrument within the scope of an undergraduate course. Hackathons are short events (1 to 3 days), where participants motivated by a common challenge gather into groups to build a software or hardware prototype. Studies show that learning is one of the main motivators of hackathon participants. Researchers are also pointing out the importance of hackathons as an informal learning approach for college students. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. This motivated us to bring that practice to the classroom, by offering an undergraduate course where students develop their semester project within a hackathon. In an attempt to systematize the steps, compress and optimize the time allocated for the ideation phase of hackathon projects, we propose a methodology for hackathons in an educational setting. The approach combines concepts from Challenge-based Learning and Design Thinking in a sequence of activities that streamlines the ideation process with regular deliveries in short time frames. This results in objective discussions and quick decision taking, fastly arriving at a project idea where students apply what they learned over the semester. We applied our approach in an Internet of Things undergraduate course within the scope of a semester project developed in an authentic 24-hour hackathon that took place in a maker space. This article details the methodology and presents a mixed methods study to analyze the students' perception on using this set of practices and techniques.","Gama, Kiev and Alencar, Breno and Calegario, Filipe and Neves, André and Alessio, Pedro",,10.1109/FIE.2018.8659264,2018,9

inproceedings,Integrating Hackathons into an Online Cybersecurity Course,"Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.","Affia, Abasi-Amefon Obot and Nolte, Alexander and Matulevičius, Raimundas",,,2022,12
inproceedings,Promoting Game Jams and Hackathons as more Women-Inclusive Environments for Informal Learning,"Hackathons and game jams are informal venues to engage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students in practical learning and nurturing interdisciplinary competencies (e.g., programming, design, communication). They also offer rich opportunities for networking and boosting the employability of participants. However, due to the not very inclusive culture created around them, these events may become hostile places for women. The low participation of women in hackathons and game jams may result in a loss of opportunity for them to improve their skills or to find jobs. Little is known about the motivations and perceptions of women participating in hackathons and game jams. We aimed at understanding (1) what are the typical gender-related problems women face in hackathons and game jams and how the perspective of men differ in regards to that problem; (2) how women perceive their motivations and their experience when participating in such events; and (3) what deters some women from participating. In this paper, we surveyed 211 participants of 8 events of this nature targeting higher education students with multidisciplinary backgrounds: 2 game jams (one of them women-focused) and 6 hackathons (one of them women-focused). Additionally, we applied a survey to hear the voice of 47 women who never attended these events to understand their lack of motivation. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we compared the perspectives of men and women who participated in the studied hackathons and game jams. The qualitative data allowed us to investigate different experiences of women who reported discomfort in these events. As contributions of this paper, based on the collected data, we report different perspectives that men and women have about gender issues in these events and highlight the typical sexist behavior (bropriating, mansplaining, etc) of men participating in hackathons and game jams. Results showed that learning is the main motivation for both men and women to join these events. We also map the common reasons for women not being motivated to participate in these types of gatherings. Finally, we propose recommendations so that hackathons and game jams can increase gender equality. Our experience suggests these events, if well planned and executed, may become drivers to change attitudes and stereotypes regarding women in computing. By lowering those barriers, women can be more engaged and stimulated so they can also take advantage of more opportunities for STEAM learning in such informal settings.","Paganini, Lavínia and Ferraz, Cláudia and Gama, Kiev and Alves, Carina",,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637301,2021,9
inproceedings,Industrial Experiences of Organizing a Hackathon to Assess a Device-centric Cloud Ecosystem,"A hackathon (hacking marathon) is an event to innovate and develop prototypes, typically lasting at most a few days. Despite several innovations having been reported resulting from hackathons and the increasing popularity of hackathons, results about, organizing of, and experiences regarding hackathons have been scarcely reported. We studied a hackathon as a means to assess a device-centric cloud ecosystem in industrial settings. We provide a descriptive account of a three-days hackathon. The experience was that the hackathon was realistic as well as an efficient and effective assessment of the requirements and design of the ecosystem, providing guidance for future development. We also summarize the lessons learned about successfully organizing a hackathon. The results also highlight encouraging experience about the hackathon among the participants in terms of the social benefits, such as collaboration, inspiration, and work motivation, resulting in repeating hackathons for various purposes in the near future. In general, the results indicate a hackathon as a promising new approach in software engineering, where speed of development is becoming essential.","Raatikainen, Mikko and Komssi, Marko and Bianco, Vittorio dal and Kindstöm, Klas and Järvinen, Janne",,10.1109/COMPSAC.2013.130,2013,10
inproceedings,Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies for Intellectual Capital (re)generation: An emerging framework,"Hackathons are events that bring together people with diverse backgrounds and expertise in a single location over a limited time to develop disruptive ideas and artifacts. The skyrocketing success of Hackathons across various domains and sectors is due to the opportunities they offer to leverage the creative and Intellectual capacity of the crowd, and to develop new relationships, skills, knowledge, solutions, and processes. However, Hackathons' potential in relation to Intellectual Capital (IC) has been overlooked by the literature so far, and few studies focus on their outcomes and evaluation. This study addresses this issue by conceptualizing Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies whose value proposition includes the (re)generation of IC at the system level. Based on this conceptualization, we leverage the authors' participant observation through active involvement in 57 Hackathons globally with various roles (i.e., participant, mentor, facilitator, jury, and organizer) between 2014-2020. Through iterative qualitative analysis carried out on the literature and empirical material, we identify 32 distinctive critical attributes through which Hackathons may differ from one another. We leverage the literature and the empirical material to highlight how each of these 32 attributes may influence the three key dimensions of IC (i.e., Human, Relational, and Structural). Our analysis offers a framework that can be useful for practitioners when approaching Hackathons and serve as a foundation for design and evaluation instruments, while opening the way for future research on Hackathons as emerging organizational forms specifically devoted to IC (re)generation.","Grande, Simona and Franco, Mattia and De Bernardi, Paola and Ricciardi, Francesca",,10.1109/ICTMOD49425.2020.9380595,2020,5
article,Curricular Hackathons for Engineering Design Learning: The Case of Engineering Design Days,"Contribution: This article defines “curricular hackathons” and describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and integrative design problems. Background: Design is an essential part of engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for formative design practice. Research Question: How can the hackathon format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology: The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and implementation. Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some level of integration and/or embedding in a program’s curriculum.","Rennick, Christopher and Litster, Greg and Hulls, C.

inproceedings,A systematic review for organizing hackathons and code camps in Covid-19 like times: Literature in demand to understand online hackathons and event result continuation,"The hackathons related systematic literature review findings, from the past 15 years, show that academics mostly focus on giving overview, describing and explaining the events. It also seems to be quite popular to present an overview of event arrangements. The research, which appears to be missing, is the new style of hackathons, which were a requirement for online hackathons and remote events because of the social distancing, e.g., what covid-19 did demand from global society. By core design, hackathons have always been social gatherings and innovation events. Especially in these exceptional times with social distancing requirements, hackathon organizers turned towards online models. As this is not the original way these events have been organized, it was hard to get the best practices to how to proceed as there are few to none general guidelines and models for online/remote hackathons. By studying the current academic literature, our systematic literature review concludes that contemporary academic literature does not give too much guidance either. This review concludes that more practical, on-site, and educational problem-based development research studies about online and remote hackathon events are needed. Especially research on means and tools to utilize to organize them and handle exceptions and be successful in new normal.","Happonen, Ari and Tikka, Matvei and Usmani, Usman Ahmad",,10.1109/ICoDSE53690.2021.9648459,2021,6
inproceedings,Community-based Hackathon as a Problem Identification Tool for Capstone Projects,"Hackathons can be defined as platforms for fostering the innovation of small, focused teams who come together to collaborate in solving a particular problem built through a new or existing technology. A community-based hackathon for problem identification was explored in a bid to advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) on ending poverty, attaining equitable quality education and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth as articulated in, “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” by the United Nations continue to be inspire impactful research on how to attain these by the target year 2030. The aim of the study was to identify the problems faced by local communities; craft proposed solutions to create a knowledge base which could be used as input for the capstone projects in the year 2023 at university X. This study used focus groups within the hackathons to gather data from three communities in the KZN, GP and WC provinces of South Africa as part of its effort to understand the application domain and associated requirements. In the paper we present the results of the hackathons. The study found that the attaining of sustainability in communities through poverty eradication and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth can only be achieved if communities sit at the centre of initiatives that seek to improve the lives of ordinary community members. Secondly the study showed the important role communities can play in their development and the power of collaboration between the local community and the universities in solving societal problems. The study also displayed the clear benefits of communities of practice and presents a foundation to sustainable development projects in the community. The study also found that communities are not short of brilliance and with some assistance they can identify and classify their problems as well as develop paper prototypes in a bid to solve the identified problems. The researchers conclude that future collaboration between the local communities and universities could be a game changer for the inclusion of real-life challenges for an authentic student learning experience.","Risinamhodzi, David T. and Heymann, Reolyn",,10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125204,2023,8
inproceedings,Edison High School WiSTEM | FOCUS: Addressing Female Underrepresentation in STEM,"Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. STEM research has the potential to revolutionize a variety of fields, alleviating real-world problems on a global scale. Yet, half of the world’s population seems to be excluded from input on the technology that is meant to change their lives. Women are chronically underrepresented in STEM fields due to gender stereotypes and a lack of self-confidence in a male-dominated sector (Ertl, Luttenberger, & Paechter, 2017). Noticing this gender disparity within their own community, Edison High School STEM Academy juniors Vasumathi Venkat and Ishani Kunadharaju formed a club based on the principles of activism and passion for STEM. Mirroring the initiative at the Rutgers WiSTEM2D Conference, which featured the work and journeys of female professionals in the STEM fields, WiSTEM | FOCUS (Women-in-STEM | Female Opportunities Created Using STEM) was created. Mission: The purpose of this club is to empower girls through STEM. Our club hosts various projects that focus on allowing students, especially future women leaders in STEM, to find more opportunities in STEM fields. Additionally, we aim to introduce the mission and resources of the global WiSTEM (Women-in-STEM) movement to our local community. Community Outreach: This year, our club launched Project I3, an initiative in which our members host informative STEM-based seminars for middle schoolers. These mini-lessons aim to teach middle schoolers niche topics that are not covered in the school curriculum, including the COVID-19 vaccine, CRISPR Cas-9 technology, chemical crime-scene analysis, and lucid dreaming science. Currently, the presentations are being delivered through Zoom due to remote learning. However, more lab-based activities will be conducted as school returns to an in-person format. Throughout the year, our club will incorporate one-day activities, such as Scratch Night to teach coding to elementary schoolers and a STEM Trivia Bowl to encourage connections between middle and high school students. Together, these programs make STEM more accessible to students from a young age. Developing Opportunities: Simultaneously, our club runs projects to augment the skills of our own members. Some members participated in HackJA 2021, a virtual beginner-level hackathon. After this experience, our club plans to promote interest in computer science through Hackathon 101 sessions for aspiring coders. To motivate our members, we also host female Edison High School alum in STEM fields as guest speakers. Additionally, our club will join several team-based competitions such as the Thomas Edison Pitch Contest and the iGEM competition. The goal of participating in these competitive activities is to help eliminate the stereotype that STEM and competition is designed only for males (Meyer, Cimpian, & Leslie, 2015).","Venkat, Vasumathi and Kunadharaju, Ishani",,10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764075,2021,1
inproceedings,Are Hackathons the New e-Learning Environments? On the Outcome of the #WirVsVirus Hackathon From a Learning Outcome Perspective,"The unprecedented situation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic holds seed grains for novel phenomena in the field of innovative learning experiences: Virtual hackathon events might represent a new form of remote co-creation, learning and upskilling. The #WirVsVirus hackathon event in Germany has been initiated by the government to compensate the lockdown-related absence of physical innovation experiences. By analyzing the data set of projects initialized during the hackathon event (n = 1,499), plus the qualitative survey feedback from 956 participants, we found that the learning curve as well as the individual learning outcome for the participates is substantial. Our findings presented in this paper lead to the conclusion that hackathons are a prosperous learning environment, even more out-come oriented than other e-Learning formats.","Krüger, Nicolai and Teuteberg, Frank",,10.1109/econf51404.2020.9385424,2020,4
inproceedings,Utilizing Hackathons to Foster Sustainable Product Innovation - The Case of a Corporate Hackathon Series,"In order to remain competitive, software companies need to continuously develop new or advance existing products. In recent years, they have increasingly turned towards organizing hackathons for this purpose. During such events, teams of employees engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. While research on hackathons has been growing steadily in recent years, there is a lack of studies focusing on the continuation of hackathon projects after an event has ended in particular in a corporate context. Our study aims to contribute to existing work in this area by focusing on a corporate hackathon series that was organized by a medium-sized Eastern European software company. Our findings support and extend prior research by indicating that teams consisting of members who aim to improve their skills, that engage in project focused preparation, focus on developing a functioning prototype that is aimed at the current customer base, easy to integrate, and related to existing products during the hackathon, had their projects continued in the case we studied. Moreover, we found indications for organizational commitment in the form of resources to continue a project after an event to predicate project integration. We also identified potential barriers towards this resource allocation related to prioritization and prior commitments of the organizational unit that was projected to continue a hackathon project after the event in the case we studied.","Leemet, Alar and Milani, Fredrik and Nolte, Alexander",,10.1109/CHASE52884.2021.00014,2021,10
inproceedings,A Systematic Mapping Study on the Organisation of Corporate Hackathons,"The hackathon phenomenon has just completed twenty years. During this period, it shifted from an event where highly skilled developers searched for bugs or randomly created a software solution to an organised event for exploring a set of technologies, challenges or themes. When promoted by software companies, these events are called corporate hackathons and mainly seek to improve their business activities by getting new ideas, prototypes or even business plans. By involving third parties, corporate hackathons become an open innovation strategy used by companies to ultimately leverage platforms and build a community of users around them, as a mechanism to establish a software ecosystem. This paper results from our motivation to understand how corporate hackathons are organised in IT industry. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study on corporate hackathons, focusing on their process (i.e. steps involved in before, during and after a hackathon) and their main characteristics (goals, participants, duration, location, and application domain). As main contribution, we reveal organisation patterns and provide recommendations for companies aiming to conduct hackathons.","Valença, George and Lacerda, Nycolas and de Souza, Cleidson R B. and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00074,2020,8
inproceedings,Hackathons in Software Engineering Education - Lessons Learned from a Decade of Events,"Hackathons are currently a hot topic in industrial learning settings. Like intensive collaborative courses (e.g. code camps), hackathons have been shown to be successful tools for learning. However, current research has failed to adequately compare the two approaches with respect to who benefits, which stakeholders are involved, and what the practical arrangement differences are. We used a literature review, our own multi-year learning experiences, and written and interview material from students and industry participants to present an overview of hackathons and code camps. Based on the results of our analysis, we present a taxonomy, based on our experiences, to help practitioners decide which kind of intensive event approach is suitable for them, depending on their industry and educational needs. This synthesis and the study results provide the first steps towards a functional definition that covers intensive collaborative working events involving real-life problems, such as code camps, hackathons, and 24-hour innovation workshops. Currently, the terminology is diverse, but there are commonalities and differences across each of these events and their purposes.","Porras, Jari and Khakurel, Jayden and Ikonen, Jouni and Happonen, Ari and Knutas, Antti and Herala, Antti and Drögehorn, Olaf",,,2018,8
inproceedings,Student perception of the contribution of Hackathon and collaborative learning approach on computer programming pass rate,"According to [8] the student's learning inspiration and adequacy can be influenced by several environmental factors which includes the learning approach and social pressure from class mates. The aim of this study is to investigate students' perceptions about the contribution of collaborative learning and the Hackathon to improve computer programming pass rate. The study included both the undergraduate and post-graduate full-time, Information Technology (IT) students at the Durban University of Technology and a selfadministered survey was used. Social cognitive theory and collaborative learning are the core theoretical frameworks that underpins this study. The outcome of students' perception was analyzed using IBM SPSS. It was found that students that collaborated with others on assignments felt that their computer programming marks would improve when participating in Hackathons. The results from this study also revealed that a high number of students are satisfied with their collaborative learning experience.","Sakhumuzi, Mhlongo Donald and Emmanuel, Oyetade Kayode",,10.1109/ICTAS.2017.7920524,2017,5
inproceedings,Effects of a Hackathon on the Motivation and Grades of CS1 Students,"Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.","Bonilla, Rafael I. and Granda, Roger and Lozano, Estefanía",,10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125187,2020,6
inproceedings,Hackathon as a Project Based Teaching Tool : Employing Programming Challenge in the Class,"Project Based Learning (PBL) develops student knowledge and skills through solving authentic, engaging and complex challenge in a fixed time span. Academic literature reports its application over a wide variety of disciplines, having both immediate and long-lasting positive effect on team working, project management, and creativity when applying technical skills. We aim to enhance student learning in software engineering. 80% of student respondents up to the date feel that programming assignments that last longer than a week overlap with other subjects enough to draw dedication away. While it unquestionably develops transferable skills, such as time management, it also might not necessarily be good through introductory courses, where students face completely new material. As a result, our aim is to employ “hackathon” - a gathering, where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over 12 to 24 hours – as a teaching tool. While there is a precedent of hackathon being used at University level, it was employed to substitute classic approach via excluding lecturing and lab work completely. Current paper presents research design and relevant discussion on measuring and validating learning outcomes when blending hackathon into traditional programming class as one of the components, not a substitute to other types of classes.","Kumalakov, Bolatzhan and Kim, Alla and Mukhtarova, Salima and Shukurova, Assel and Khon, Natalya",,10.1109/ICAICT.2018.8747149,2018,5

The hackathon served as a pivot-point from bachelor studies and challenged students to collaborate, in a time-stressed situation, for achieving a common result. Within a time-bound of 2 days competitive event, participants have to collaborate to build proofs of concept and minimum viable products for specific topics with innovative perspectives. This type of hackathon realized with e.DO Cube offered various advantages, among them the inclusivity (gender gap) and agility, it promotes multidisciplinary collaboration, and it is an innovative method to promote new ideas and original POCs (Proof of Concepts) within Manufacturing 4.0 scope. The proposal also includes a study done by POLIMI to measure the effectiveness of this specific pedagogical approach towards specific learning outcomes.","Sullivan, Brendan P. and Rossi, Monica and Ramundo, Lucia and Rosa, Paolo and Terzi, Sergio",,10.1109/ICE/ITMC-IAMOT55089.2022.10033249,2022,6
inproceedings,A social-cognitive analysis of a female-focused hackathon,"Hackathons are thematic events of short duration that focus on the development of software prototypes. These events normally last from one to three days and they are increasingly popular. However, the interest of women in these events is still low. This paper aims to investigate, from a social-cognitive perspective, how experiences of more inclusive hackathon formats affect interest in hackathons themselves. We adopted autoethnography to systematize the first author's experience as a team participant in a female-focused hackathon. The results suggest that event formats can affect participants’ self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations and goals. These beliefs may influence perceptions of their potential performance on the team, confidence in their own skills in the technology and perceptions of opportunities in the technology market.

article,Crowdsourcing Properties and Mechanisms of Mega Hackathons: The Case of Junction,"Hackathons are time-bounded crowdsourcing events, which have recently prospered in many technology and science domains across the globe. We study Europe’s largest hackathon, Junction, to better understand the distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of this type of hackathon as a form of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Moreover, we determined how they add value to attending companies and participants. In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed. Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection, strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential, and pervasive information technology. Based on our findings, we argue that these properties and mechanisms increase the possibility of finding innovative solutions to companies’ problems in Junction-like mega hackathons. This article concludes with managerial implications for companies to consciously plan and prepare while knowing what to expect during the hackathon.","Jaribion, Alireza and Khajavi, Siavash H. and Järvihaavisto, Ulriikka and Nurmi, Iiro and Gustafsson, Robin and Holmström, Jan",,10.1109/TEM.2021.3079107,2023,15
inproceedings,Opportunities and constraints of women-focused online hackathons,"Hackathons are often viewed as not being inclusive to women, who have low participation in these events. Reasons for this include low self-esteem in STEM fields, toxic environments, bad sleeping habits during the event, and a competitive atmosphere. Hackathons also can be a valuable opportunity for undergraduate students to improve their skills, but a lack of gender diversity can prevent women from taking advantage of these opportunities. Recently, initiatives have been implemented to increase the number of women participating in hackathons, such as women-only events, balancing participants by gender during the selection process, and using feminist and social themes for the hackathon. Our qualitative study investigated how event design choices (Focus on Women; Event support activities such as mentoring and pre-pitch; and Event warm-up activities) can influence the participant’s experience in a women-focused hackathon. Data was collected through surveys and semi-structured interviews with participants.","Paganini, Lavínia and Gama, Kiev and Nolte, Alexander and Serebrenik, Alexander",,10.1109/GEICSE59319.2023.00009,2023,8

inproceedings,Experiences and Lessons Learned from Onsite and Remote Teamwork Based Courses in Software Engineering,"Education is changing rapidly towards digital and online forms in universities. E.g. digitalization and Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)s evolve remote education tools, which changes the teaching approaches. Covid-19 accelerated digital transition from classroom-based education towards hybrid models, then online classes and finally to fully online education. While the education has moved from classrooms to Internet environment, the suitability of this transition has not really been evaluated. This is especially important to teamwork based courses in which the collaboration within teams and between teams is considered a major part of the learning outcomes of the course. Our study presents experiences on transforming a set of software engineering courses from a fully onsite course to a fully online course and lessons we have learned on that transition. We analyze hackathon and capstone style courses for traditional and remote execution modes. We have used hackathons for decades and have experience of different types of implementations. For capstones we have two different courses that we have experience with. Analyzing the team-based courses shows focal points which area hard to solve with online approaches. Online environment does not only make students faceless to the teacher but also to other teammates. This is especially visible in the long-lasting capstone courses.","Porras, Jari and Happonen, Ari and Khakurel, Jayden",,10.1109/ICoDSE53690.2021.9648490,2021,9
inproceedings,Short Datathon for the Interdisciplinary Development of Data Analysis and Visualization Skills,"Understanding the major fraud problems in the world and interpreting the data available for analysis is a current challenge that requires interdisciplinary knowledge to complement the knowledge of computer professionals. Collaborative events (called Hackathons, Datathons, Codefests, Hack Days, etc.) have become relevant in several fields. Examples of fields which are explored in these events include startup development, open civic innovation, corporate innovation, and social issues. These events have features that favor knowledge exchange to solve challenges. In this paper, we present an event format called Short Datathon, a Hackathon for the development of exploratory data analysis and visualization skills. Our goal is to evaluate if participating in a Short Datathon can help participants learn basic data analysis and visualization concepts. We evaluated the Short Datathon in two case studies, with a total of 20 participants, carried out at the Federal University of Technology - Paraná. In both case studies we addressed the issue of tax evasion using real world data. We describe, as a result of this work, the qualitative aspects of the case studies and the perception of the participants obtained through questionnaires. Participants stated that the event helped them understand more about data analysis and visualization and that the experience with people from other areas during the event made data analysis more efficient. Further studies are necessary to evolve the format of the event and to evaluate its effectiveness.","Noguera Salinas, Myrian Raquel and Figueiredo Pereira Emer, Maria Claudia and Serra Seca Neto, Adolfo Gustavo",,10.1109/CHASE.2019.00031,2019,4

article,A Study of Cybersecurity Education Using a Present-Test-Practice-Assess Model,"Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats; consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance; 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance; and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities.","Workman, Michael D. and Luévanos, J.

Working closely with a partner NGO, we provided students with ideas, a sample database, programming tutorials and design feedback. Our hackathon was very successful, resulting in high-quality work and student engagement. In addition to reporting on lessons learned, we will also discuss the top two projects. One was Homeless Helpline, an automated voice system that allows homeless clients to call in and receive information about the services available to them in their area. This project ties into our partner NGO's existing database to automatically extract the information needed for the user, allowing anyone with access to a phone - even a payphone or a feature cell phone - to get access to this information, with very little cost to the NGO. The other project we discuss takes a different approach, making the same information available as a smartphone app, allowing the user to get more precise information about the services closest to their current location, alongside directions, etc. The hackathon was successful enough that we intend to make it an annual event. The paper will also discuss our thoughts on how to host your own successful socially-motivated hackathon for undergraduates.","Linnell, Natalie and Figueira, Silvia and Chintala, Neil and Falzarano, Lauren and Ciancio, Vincente",,10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970341,2014,8
inproceedings,Cybersecurity Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Proactive and Collaborative Learning Paradigm,"This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.","Wei-Kocsis, Jin and Sabounchi, Moein and Yang, Baijian and Zhang, Tonglin",,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962643,2022,5

article,An Exploration of Hackathons as Time Intense and Collaborative Forms of Crowdsourcing,"Crowdsourcing has attracted increasing attention as an open innovation tool that enables firms to access the ideas and solutions of external crowds of participants. Among various crowdsourcing formats, hackathons have emerged as a form of collaborative crowdsourcing that emphasizes team-based collaboration among participants to co-create solutions to firms’ challenges under intense time pressures. Despite their increasing popularity, limited focus has been placed on understanding how hackathons should be organized and managed and the challenges that these time-intense collaborative events generate for both firms and participants. Based on a qualitative, multiple case study of six on-site hackathons, we identify and discuss four key design practices that shape these collaborative crowdsourcing forms, namely 1) problem formulation; 2) participant attraction and team composition; 3) developing the evaluation system; and 4) facilitating idea development. We show that these design practices are interrelated, with decisions about one design practice having important implications for the others, and discuss key challenges that arise from their combination. Overall, our findings highlight how organizing and managing hackathons is a complex matter that requires firms to adopt a more holistic and complementary approach. Implications for innovation management research and practice are discussed.","Beretta, Michela and Obwegeser, Nikolaus and Bauer, Stefan",,10.1109/TEM.2022.3174712,2022,15

The novelty of the approach is that we organize the technical workshop at our regular project progress meetings as a challenge-based contest involving all partners in the project. Case study partners submit their challenges related to the project goals and their use cases in advance. These challenges are concise enough to be experimented within approximately 4 hours. Teams are then formed to address those challenges. The teams include tool/method providers, case study owners and researchers/developers from other consortium members. On the hackathon day, partners work together to come with results addressing the challenges that are both interesting to encourage collaboration and convincing to continue further deeper investigations. Obtained results demonstrate that the hackathon approach stimulated knowledge exchanges among project partners and triggered new collaborations, notably between tool providers and use case owners.","Sadovykh, Andrey and Truscan, Dragos and Pierini, Pierluigi and Widforss, Gunnar and Ashraf, Adnan and Bruneliere, Hugo and Smrz, Pavel and Bagnato, Alessandra and Afzal, Wasif and Hortelano, Alexandra Espinosa",,10.23919/DATE.2019.8715247,2019,6

inproceedings,Encourage students to apply their knowledge and think “out of the box” while collaborating with local industry - Case Study Industrial Seminar,"Our societies require talented engineers, who are trained in different engineering fields. Simultaneously these students should have the ability to collaborate and work with people of different disciplines and be able to look for innovation. Engineering programs have been developing different approaches to enhance these required skills, for example through capstones and hackathons. Capstones projects, which are often several months long, aim to prepare students for the transition from school to work. Frequently, these projects are designed to serve companies or startups. Hackathon events are intense and short sessions where students solve a challenge in short periods of time, often between 24 to 36 hours. However, it is needed an approach that exposes students, of different disciplines, to a wider number of industries with a more collaborative approach. We need interventions in which students can experience how their knowledge contributes to the innovation and visions of different stakeholders. Furthermore, these learning interventions, where we promote a collaborative experience among the participants where everybody learns from everybody, should require less time than with capstones or hackathons. The University of Turku developed the Industrial Seminar on Future Technologies course for master and phd advanced students, where we address: multidisciplinarity, collaboration, connection with engineering industry and innovation. Students in this course are exposed to challenges and visions of different companies in diverse domains, e.g. biotechnology, metal industry, maritime. Each seminar session focuses on one company, and we work together to address the session's aim in at most four hours. For each session participants have a pre-assignment, which is aligned to the objective of the session, and a post-assignment that focuses on the session's reflection. An important aspect to make each session successful is the preparation of the session with the local company. Hence this course addresses different objectives: (i) Expose students to industry, (ii) Students gain awareness of how their knowledge is relevant for different industry challenges and visions, (iii) Collaboration between session participants (from different backgrounds and from the guest company), (iv) Possibility to innovate (“think out of the box”), (v) University of Turku builds bridges with the local industry, as together with each guest company we go through a process of “sharpening” the company's challenge or vision for this particular seminar session. In this paper we analyze this course with its outcomes, utilizing the final results of each session, and the feedback from students and industry representatives.","Sedano, Carolina Islas and Vasankari, Timo",,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637449,2021,8

article,An IoT and Wearable Technology Hackathon for Promoting Careers in Computer Science,"This paper explores the use of a constructivist 21st-century learning model to implement a week-long workshop, delivered as a “hackathon,” to encourage preuniversity teenagers to pursue careers in STEM, with a particular emphasis on computer science. For Irish preuniversity students, their experience of computing can vary from word processing to foundational programming, and while many schools are looking to introduce more ICT into the classroom, many students are left with a narrow view of what computer science is all about. Twenty-one students participated in the workshop and completed pre- and post-surveys, and a free word association exercise in the areas of computing and careers in computing. Analysis revealed that students’ motivation to learn about the design process, programming, inputs and outputs, and wearable technology (wearables)/Internet of Things (IoT) increased following participation. There were also increases in confidence in inputs and outputs and wearables/IoT following participation, as well as changes in the computing word associations, with students associating computing more with computer programming terms rather than general terms such as the Internet. The findings suggest that the combination of a hackathon event and a model for 21st century learning can be effective in motivating and increasing the self-efficacy of preuniversity teenagers in a number of emerging technological contexts such as IoT and wearables.","Byrne, Jake Rowan and O’Sullivan, Katriona and Sullivan, Kevin",,10.1109/TE.2016.2626252,2017,9
inproceedings,Quantum computing online workshops and hackathon for Spanish speakers: A case study,"We discuss the challenges and findings of organizing an online event in Spanish, consisting of a series of introductory workshops leading up to a quantum hackathon for Latin America. 220 Spanish speakers were registered, 66% of whom self-identified as being at an introductory level of quantum computing. We gain a better picture of the impact of quantum computing in Latin America, and the importance of generating educational resources in Spanish about quantum computing. Additionally, we report results on surveying the participants by country; educational status; self-reported levels of quantum computing, linear algebra, and Python competency; and their areas of interest within quantum.This event was organized by Quantum Universal Education with the Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CIC-IPN) as the host institution, in collaboration with a number of organizations and companies: IBM Quantum, Xanadu, Multiverse Computing, Quantum Universal Education, Quantum Hispano, QMexico, Haq.ai, Dive in Learning. This was part of a larger event, the Qiskit Fall Fest 2021, as one of several hackathons organized around the world in a similar span of time.

article,LYSTO: The Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon and Benchmark Dataset,"We introduce LYSTO, the Lymphocyte Assessment Hackathon, which was held in conjunction with the MICCAI 2019 Conference in Shenzhen (China). The competition required participants to automatically assess the number of lymphocytes, in particular T-cells, in images of colon, breast, and prostate cancer stained with CD3 and CD8 immunohistochemistry. Differently from other challenges setup in medical image analysis, LYSTO participants were solely given a few hours to address this problem. In this paper, we describe the goal and the multi-phase organization of the hackathon; we describe the proposed methods and the on-site results. Additionally, we present post-competition results where we show how the presented methods perform on an independent set of lung cancer slides, which was not part of the initial competition, as well as a comparison on lymphocyte assessment between presented methods and a panel of pathologists. We show that some of the participants were capable to achieve pathologist-level performance at lymphocyte assessment. After the hackathon, LYSTO was left as a lightweight plug-and-play benchmark dataset on grand-challenge website, together with an automatic evaluation platform. LYSTO has supported a number of research in lymphocyte assessment in oncology. LYSTO will be a long-lasting educational challenge for deep learning and digital pathology, it is available at https://lysto.grand-challenge.org/.","Jiao, Yiping and van der Laak, Jeroen and Albarqouni, Shadi and Li, Zhang and Tan, Tao and Bhalerao, Abhir and Cheng, Shenghua and Ma, Jiabo and Pocock, Johnathan and Pluim, Josien P.W. and Koohbanani, Navid Alemi and Bashir, Raja Muhammad Saad and Raza, Shan E Ahmed and Liu, Sibo and Graham, Simon and Wetstein, Suzanne and Khurram, Syed Ali and Liu, Xiuli and Rajpoot, Nasir and Veta, Mitko and Ciompi, Francesco",,10.1109/JBHI.2023.3327489,2023,12
article,A Systems Engineering Hackathon – A Methodology Involving Multiple Stakeholders to Progress Conceptual Design of a Complex Engineered Product,"This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and communication of information across traditional engineering and operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured around the technical functions within an engineering company has the capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80% reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with using current/regular internal methods.","Saravi, S. and Joannou, D. and Kalawsky, R.

inproceedings,Improving Student’s Learning and Cooperation Skills Using Coding Dojos (In the Wild!),"Collaborative development approaches (e.g., pair programming, coding dojo, and hackathons) have gained increasing attention in recent years, mostly because they help to share knowledge during software development activities and might shorten development cycles and increase the quality of software products. Collaborative development approaches bring also the potential benefit to contribute to learning activities. For instance, novices might participate on collaborative development sessions in order to learn new development practices, tools, and techniques used in a software development project. Besides these potential benefits, little is known about the perception of students engaged in collaborative development efforts. Therefore, in this paper we investigate whether or not the engagement of students in collaborative development efforts contributes to the learning process of software development practices and techniques, as well as the perceived benefits and challenges related to collaborative software development activities. To this end, we first performed several of coding dojo sessions during a period of 18 months. These development sessions have been conducted within the context of a real software modernization effort, which aims to modernize two enterprise systems of the Brazilian Army. After that, we carried out a qualitative study where the participants (students, software developers, and software architects) answered a survey, in order to understand the learning benefits of using coding dojo in software development activities. The results so far are encouraging. Coding Dojos allowed professors and software architects to seamless share their experience in software development with the students. According to the answers, the methodology created a better environment for the team, allowing better discussions and ideas to be shared and implemented. This has helped the team members to solve problems easier than by themselves, bringing additional benefits, such as steep the learning curve in programming languages, usage of development tools, understanding the requirements, and code refactoring.","de Oliveira, Caio Matheus Campos and Canedo, Edna Dias and Faria, Henrique and Amaral, Luis Henrique Vieira and Bonifácio, Rodrigo",,10.1109/FIE.2018.8659056,2018,8

inproceedings,Teaching Entrepreneurship for Computer Science and Engineering Students Using Active Learning Pedagogical Strategies,"Contribution: This innovative practice full paper presents a novel approach based on active learning pedagogical strategies and entrepreneurship programmes to teach entrepreneurship to computer science and engineering students. The proposed approach has been tailored for undergraduate classes in order to provide the students with the initial stages of developing a technological startup. Background: Within the computer science and engineering literature, there are some interesting works that deal with entrepreneurial education in different levels and concepts. However, there has not been a paper describing a hands-on approach that makes them experience the important initial stages of a startup. Intended Outcomes: By the end of the course the students will be able to: (1) Validate whether or not their idea can become a business; (2) Build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for their solution; (3) Elaborate a Business Model Canvas (BMC); (4) Present their solution and BMC to potential investors. Application Design: There are some very interesting approaches to teach entrepreneurship in programmes outside of the university, such as the startup weekend, which has created several successful startups. Findings: Before taking this module the majority of the students did not have any contact with any type of entrepreneurship education programme or startup related event such as hackathons. While taking the module, several students attended related events. Some of them got involved with other university entrepreneurship initiates.","Silla, Carlos N.",,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637243,2021,6

inproceedings,"Motivating and Demystifying IoT Learning with Hackathons in a Maker Space, Low-code Development and Rapid Prototyping","The ACM Computing Curricula 2020 states that the Internet of Things (IoT) is a field in computing that currently lacks an officially endorsed curriculum. This means that it is not yet considered a fully established academic discipline with a widely accepted curriculum that has been recognized or approved by organizations like ACM or IEEE. Given the rapid evolution and interdisciplinary nature of IoT, it can be challenging to determine the most appropriate content to include or exclude in IoT courses. This paper presents an elective course designed to quickly introduce students from Computer Science and Information Systems to the world of IoT. The course focuses on learning application-level communication protocols, the basics of rapid hardware prototyping with Raspberry Pi, and a low-code development tool (Node-RED) to quickly develop IoT applications. For their course project, students worked in teams during a weekend hackathon to build a working prototype of an IoT device with a Raspberry Pi, sensors, and actuators. The hackathon took place in a maker space in the information technology innovation park of the region. The paper provides feedback from 29 students from the two cohorts that took the course, and the qualitative data analysis shows that this approach indeed lowered the barrier to computer science and information systems students having their first contact with IoT development.","Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/SERP4IoT59158.2023.00009,2023,8

inproceedings,"EnerGyan: A Portable Platform for Microgrid Education, Research, and Development","Energy management for microgrids is becoming an increasingly important topic for effective integration of diverse electricity sources and loads. Real-world deployment of microgrids requires hands-on experience in three key areas: education, research, and development. Most undergraduate and graduate classes on microgrids today take a theoretical learning approach, and the few that offer laboratory sessions often use analog based systems. In the microgrid research community, advanced control and optimization are often validated using numerical simulations or very specific and expensive lab hardware. This area of study also lacks a development platform for users to do rapid prototyping of microgrid solutions, making real-world implementation challenging. This paper introduces EnerGyan [1], a low-cost platform for education, research, and development for energy management in microgrids. It is a portable end-to-end platform which integrates energy infrastructure (energy sources, converters, storage, loads), communication and computing infrastructure (on-board computer, communication modules, user interfaces), and an energy management system, making it a programmable electricity-grid-in-a-box. EnerGyan also provides a software toolkit called EnerGyanToolKit, allowing users to develop and deploy energy applications. EnerGyan has been used for microgrid research, in teaching (workshops, lab course, hackathons), and as development tool (for managing a building microgrid).","Manur, Ashray and Sehloff, David and Venkataramanan, Giri",,10.1109/PEDES.2018.8707745,2018,6

inproceedings,Development of individual learning paths system in engineering education,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents development of individual learning paths system in engineering education using the example of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). A set of technological approaches, called Industry 4.0, appeared about 10 years ago. The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future. The system of engineering education is based on the principles of individualization of educational and professional paths, practical orientation, development of soft skills, mobility. Personal education path - it's not just a student's choice, but it's very labor-intensive, properly designed work of educational institution, where not only the whole university is engaged, but also its partner employers.The Moscow Aviation Institute is implementing the integrated concept of ""personalization"". The peculiarity of individual learning path at the university is that at the first stage of its formation the potential direction and place of professional activity are determined, the necessary competencies to be acquired are accounted, and an individual development plan is formed. The holders of the typical student paths at Moscow Aviation Institute are the internal employer-divisions - Competency Centers, which have become the integrators of forward-looking technologies and are conducting a large number of projects commissioned by the industry. Also, the MAI Competence Centers help students to form the path to the professions in demand in the future, providing an opportunity for practice and mastering additional engineering, technological and managerial competences.Students comprehend their personal learning pathways at three levels. First at the level of the educational program through the identification of elective courses and places of practice after consultation with the tutor. Second, at the academic level, they master the chapters and topics that are the most relevant to student's current or future professional activity. Finally, a committed student can use internships, hackathons, Academic exchange and many other ways to form a unique path, outside the formal learning process.At the same time, an important task is the formation of healthy competition between students in obtaining access to certain modules of individual path.","Pogosyan, Mikhail A.",,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274140,2020,8

Each social organization was allocated with several teams that addressed its challenges, considered in our context as a micro-crowd (MC). We performed a study for examining the influence of the collaborative environment on the MCs’ requirements engineering (RE) activities, and specifically how the structured online boards facilitate the DT process. Following a qualitative analysis of the shared boards, our findings indicate the ways in which the shared collaborative tool and the multidisciplinary nature of the MCs contributed to the high-quality outcomes developed by the teams.

This activity was organized thanks to a three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving problem: Lane Departure detection. This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting, but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to expect outstanding results ? the best one was only slightly over 3% above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking into consideration for example computer power load of the different algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of view.","Alekseenko, Andrey and Dang, Hien Q. and Bansal, Gaurav and Sanchez-Medina, Javier and Miyajima, Chiyomi and Hirayama, Takatsugu and Takeda, Kazuya and Ide, Ichiro",,10.1109/MITS.2018.2880264,2019,16

The data set has nine features. In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XG Boost). Such models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on the predictive errors obtained between these models.

article,Video Game Development in a Rush: A Survey of the Global Game Jam Participants,"Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several studies have reported that periods of “crunch time” are prevalent in the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration, minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities. Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic “crunch time” and argue that game jam organizers are in a good position to problematize the phenomenon.","Borg, Markus and Garousi, Vahid and Mahmoud, Anas and Olsson, Thomas and Stålberg, Oskar",,10.1109/TG.2019.2910248,2020,14

The development of apps during events planned and conducted by DevRel team (e.g., hackathons or developer conferences) requires an approach that allows developers to achieve the expected performance into the MSECO. However, there is a quality contribution barrier, the App Store, the App Store's criteria do not guarantee that apps certified by these criteria have good performance in number of downloads and positive reviews into the MSECO. Aims: We present an evaluation of a mobile certification approach for the MSECO context, called MSECO-CERT (Mobile Software ECOsystem app CERTification), in terms of mobile application downloads, ratings and changes in developers' attitudes. MSECO-CERT comprises support (MSECO-SUP) and development (MSECO-DEV) processes. We describe two empirical studies: feasibility and observational. MSECO-CERT produced a growth coefficient of downloads (363%) and average user ratings (28%) when compared to an ad hoc approach. We observed that the DevRel practitioners (i.e., developer evangelists) and most of the developers (70%) considered MSECO-SUP and MSECO-DEV processes easy to use. They indicate that they would use both processes in the future. The results indicate that a keystone needs to invest in the analysis of their certification processes considering the ecosystem elements and also create mechanisms that allow monitoring the effect of DevRel activities. Our studies also helped to evolve MSECO-CERT by refining roles, activities and artifacts.","Fontão, Awdren and Paes, Pedro and Ekwoge, Oswald and Santos, Rodrigo Pereira Dos and Dias-Neto, Arilo Claudio",,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009921,2020,15

article,Advanced Ensemble Model for Solar Radiation Forecasting Using Sine Cosine Algorithm and Newton’s Laws,"As research in alternate energy sources is growing, solar radiation is catching the eyes of the research community immensely. Since solar energy generation depends on uncontrollable natural variables, without proper forecasting, this energy source cannot be trusted. For this forecasting, the use of machine learning algorithms is one of the best choices. This paper proposed an optimized solar radiation forecasting ensemble model consisting of pre-processing and training ensemble phases. The training ensemble phase works on an advanced sine cosine algorithm (ASCA) using Newton’s laws of gravity and motion for objects (agents). ASCA uses sine and cosine functions to update the agent’s position/velocity components by considering its mass. The training ensemble model is then developed using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression. The performance of the proposed ensemble model is measured using a dataset from Kaggle (Solar Radiation Prediction, Task from NASA Hackathon). The proposed ASCA algorithm is evaluated in comparison with the Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Hybrid Greedy Sine Cosine Algorithm with Differential Evolution (HGSCADE), Hybrid Modified Sine Cosine Algorithm with Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HMSCACSA), Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), and Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA). Obtained results of the proposed ensemble model are compared with those of state-of-the-art models, and significant superiority of the proposed ensemble model is confirmed using statistical analysis such as ANOVA and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests.","El-Kenawy, El-Sayed M. and Mirjalili, Seyedali and Ghoneim, Sherif S.

The aim of this research is to identify problems in the employers' circle when it comes to hiring fresh graduates. The educational system is critical to information about the needs of employers in order to adapt educational programs to the needs of the labor market, to formulate learning outcomes in education programs and define occupational standards. The focus is on key competencies of candidates that are indispensable in today's labor market. The paper will show: what are the expectations of companies that actively seek workers? What are the priority competencies? Is there a scale of expected competencies? We want to find out how participants in the labor market are thinking about cooperation with educational institutions and which concrete ways of cooperation are considered effective in terms of training. What is the relationship between business and institutional education in defining and developing competency requirements? We proceed from the assumption that key skills create the competitive advantage of graduates because they talk about how they use their expertise.

inproceedings,Role of Indian Higher Education Institutions towards Aatmanirbhar India: Government Policies and Initiatives to promote Entrepreneurship and Innovation,"The Prime Minister of India in 2020 announced his vision of Aatmanirbhar India to make India an economically self-reliant nation. He shared this vision while announcing the 1st economic package to support the Indian population during the COVID19 pandemic. He believed Aatmanirbhar India could be achieved through pursuing policies that are competent, efficient, and resilient along with being self-generating and self-sustaining. This vision was well aligned and would contribute significantly to India's plan of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025. However, achieving this vision would have required systemic changes in India's DNA as a larger section of the India population needed to become Innovators and Entrepreneurs. One element of adapting to this new DNA was envisioned through the development of innovation and entrepreneurial mindset among the youth of the country. It was important to capitalize on the potential of the young minds and awaken the innovators among the students in K-12 and especially higher education. In the last 3 years, the Ministry of Education (previously Ministry of Human Resource Development) along with other central organizations such as the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) etc have come up with a range of policies and initiatives, all strategically aligned to foster an ecosystem for entrepreneurship and innovation (I&E) in higher education institutions (HEIs). In this paper, we highlight a set of initiatives and policies launched up by the government of India to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in HEI's. We elaborate on the National Startup and Innovation Policy, New Education Policy (NEP) along with national initiatives such as Smart India Hackathon, ARIAA (National I&E ranking) and others. Case-studies are presented of noteworthy HEI's who have transformed themselves by using the government's efforts as catalysts to nurture I&E. At the end, we highlight the potential of HEI's in India to collectively contribute to helping India become Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) in the post-Pandemic world.","Kandakatla, Rohit and Aluvalu, Rajanikanth and Devireddy, Sreedevi and Kulkarni, Nitin and Joshi, Gopal",,10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657261,2021,7

limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance
in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for
teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for
some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited
to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to
investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the
academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research
was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South

article,"Healthcare hackathons: fostering medical education through innovation in
a developing country: a case study from Pakistan","Background Hackathons aim to develop solutions to preidentified problem
domains and catalyse startup cultures. Recently, the teaching and
learning potential of hackathons has also been documented. In this
study, we make the case for utilisation of hackathons as an alternative
teaching and learning tool geared towards entrepreneurship and as an
opportunity for interprofessional integration.
Methods This research study followed up with participants from the third
hackathon at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. Hack MedEd
was about solutions to problems of undergraduate and postgraduate
medical education with an emphasis on low--income to middle-income
countries. Participant evaluation data were filled at the end of the
hackathon and gathered from three focused group discussions (FGDs):
immediately before and after the event, a delayed follow-up after 11
months was recorded.
Results Of 116 participants, the majority (71\%) were under 30 years
old, and over half were female. The evaluations provided by hackers were
positive overall with a mean score of 4.37 out of 5 on a Likert Scale.
During the FGDs, participants spoke positively of the process and felt
that, by the end of the hackathon, they had learnt something new. In the
delayed follow-up FGD, teams that had undergone incubation expressed
that they had gained a critical and simple skillset that they might not
have acquired otherwise.
Conclusion Hackathons business incubation programmes may be considered
an alternative teaching and learning tool-especially for individuals
studying or working within the healthcare discipline within
low--resource settings.","Butt, Waqaas Akmal and Shahood, Qurratulain and Farooqi, Walid Hussain

article,Using the Hackathon Model in Social Work Education,"A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer
hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by
problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop
creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the
evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed
practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57)
developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented
in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5),
evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The
evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon
promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of
concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged
were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred
that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More
research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of
social work curricula including the teaching of various research
methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work
profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt
social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and

article,Hackathons: what do engineering educators think about it?,"Purpose With past studies indicating a lack of skill development in
engineering education, there is a need for new pedagogical tools that
are application and skill-oriented. Hackathons are widely accepted in
the corporate world, in the engineering domain for skill development and
recruitment but have not gained acceptance in mainstream engineering
education. Very few studies have discussed engineering educator views
regarding hackathons and their benefits. This paper intends to study
engineering educators' perception of the hackathon and its benefits
after participating in it. The findings could support hackathons as a
pedagogical tool to develop an industry-oriented and skill-based
engineering education. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods
design was employed where initially qualitative study was conducted. Its
findings were used to conduct survey of 162 engineering educators who
had participated in a hackathon. A five point Likert scale was employed
for data collection. Findings The findings reveal that engineering
educators who participated in the hackathon perceived hackathons to
support industry-focused learning, problem-solving and new skill
development. They also acknowledged its role in their professional
development. The further discussion suggests that engineering educators
and institutes may collaborate with industry to design and use
hackathons as a teaching tool to develop industry-ready graduates.
Research limitations/implications The study was not designed to study
how different aspects of hackathon lead to different benefits derived
from participating in it. There is a need to study hackathons as a tool
of pedagogy and assessment, focusing on how variables linked to it
facilitate, moderate and hinder the learning and assessment process in
participants. More in-depth studies need to be conducted to adopt the
hackathon as a pedagogy and assessment tool in higher education.
Practical implications The discussion suggests that designing hackathons
effectively as a tool for learning and skill development will result in
skilled graduates. Engineering educators should adopt hackathons as a
pedagogy for their students. Management and policymakers of engineering
institutes should consider hackathons as a part of pedagogy for students
besides conducting hackathons for educators for their professional
development that will be investment in skills helpful at workplace.
Originality/value The notable contribution of this paper is to document
perceptions of engineering educators regarding hackathons and their
benefits after participating in a hackathon. The paper proposes that
hackathons can be introduced in the engineering curriculum as they would
offer educators a novel method of teaching and assessment and support
engineering graduates in recruitment and making them industry-ready.","Mehta, Neha and Bist, Siddarth Singh and Shah, Priya","Engineering educators; Hackathon; Pedagogical tool; Professional

article,"An Extended Hackathon Model for Collaborative Education in Medical
Innovation","To support the next generation of healthcare innovators - whether they
be engineers, designers, clinicians, or business experts by training -
education in the emerging field of medical innovation should be made
easily and widely accessible to undergraduate students, graduate
students, and young professionals, early in their careers. Currently,
medical innovation curricula are taught through semester-long courses or
year-long fellowships at a handful of universities, reaching only a
limited demographic of participants. This study describes the structure
and preliminary outcomes of a 1-2week extended hackathon course that
seeks to make medical innovation education and training more accessible
and easily adoptable for academic medical centers. Eight extended
hackathons were hosted in five international locations reaching 245
participants: Beijing (June 2015 and August 2016), Hong Kong (June 2016,
2017, and 2018), Curitiba (July 2016), Stanford (October 2017), and SAo
Paulo (May 2018). Pre- and post-hackathon surveys asking respondents to
self-assess their knowledge in ten categories of medical innovation were
administered to quantify the perceived degree of learning. Participants
hailed from a diverse range of educational backgrounds, domains of
expertise, and academic institutions. On average, respondents (n=161)
saw a greater than twofold increase (114.1\%, P<0.001) from their pre-
to post-hackathon scores. In this study, the extended hackathon is
presented as a novel educational model to teach undergraduate and
graduate students a foundational skillset for medical innovation.
Participants reported gaining significant knowledge across all ten
categories assessed. To more robustly assess the educational value of
extended hackathons, a standardized assessment for medical innovation
knowledge needs to be developed, and a larger sample size of
participants surveyed.","Wang, Jason K. and Pamnani, Ravinder D. and Capasso, Robson and Chang,

article,"Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease
Outbreaks Through Hackathons","Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is
one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of
teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from
this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching
topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period
of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the
essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in
controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally
do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a
critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate
engineering students about public health without interfering with
required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons,
short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an
engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge
of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the
effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of
engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application
Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were
engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused
hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was
assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre-
and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the
hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering
students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an
increased understanding of public health professions and how they can
contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore,
hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering
students about topics outside of their discipline.","Pakpour, Nazzy and Nouredini, Sahar and Tandon, James","Public healthcare; Engineering students; Diseases; Medical services;

article,"The Effects of Hackathons on the Entrepreneurial Skillset and Perceived
Self-Efficacy as Factors Shaping Entrepreneurial Intentions","Purpose: While traditional university programs primarily use regularly
scheduled classes as the primary means for developing students, this
program evaluation explores the direct effects of intensive
entrepreneurial learning activity in the format of a hackathon. This is
one of the first papers to explore the learning outcomes of hackathons
as an intensive entrepreneurial pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach:
The researchers implemented a pre-test/post-test model with students
participating in an entrepreneurship hackathon and tested the changes in
their confidence levels in the ability to craft a successful
entrepreneurial venture. Findings: The results support a hackathon model
of entrepreneurial learning. As the result of a one-day workshop,
significant results were achieved for self-reported ability in
identifying a viable entrepreneurial concept, and for having the ability
to successfully launch a new venture. Further, class standing and prior
entrepreneurial courses, as well as gender did not influence the
learning outcomes. Importantly, while hackathon-generated increases in
entrepreneurial self-efficacy proved to be statistically significant,
same gains proved not to be significant in a traditional
entrepreneurship class setting. Authors conclude that short, intensive
entrepreneurship learning methods like hackathons may be more effective
in developing entrepreneurial self-efficacy than semester long courses.
Originality/value: A hackathon is likely an effective entrepreneurial
learning methodology suitable for a general student population which
includes students with limited knowledge of and interest in
entrepreneurship. The usefulness of a hackathon for entrepreneurial
learning has potential implications for educators, scholars and policy
makers. For educators, a hackathon approach may outperform a number of
traditional entrepreneurship pedagogies in the form of lectures, case
studies, class discussions or even a business plan development over a
semester-long course. A hackathon may also allow students to gain
entrepreneurial skills and self-confidence much quicker and using less
resources than in a traditional entrepreneurial course. The potential
reasons for these findings as well as their implications are discussed
along with future research areas.","Szymanska, Izabela and Sesti, Tom and Motley, Hali and Puia, George","entrepreneurial learning; hackathons; entrepreneurial self-efficacy;

embedded in the working cultures of film and TV professionals impeded
the team's ability to involve all participants on an equal footing. As

Methodology: In this study, we developed a 3 day event consisting of
guest lectures, a documentary screening and a hackathon supported by
academics and experts in the field, to provide students with the
opportunity to learn more about and work in interdisciplinary teams
within global surgery. Students had the option to attend just the
lectures or both the lectures and hackathon. Quantitative and
qualitative results were collected through a pre and post session
survey.
Results: A total of 21 responses were received for the hackathon and 26
responses for the general event (response rate for event = 26 \%,
response rate for hackathon = 24.7 \%). There was a significant
improvement in understanding of interdisciplinary working in global
surgery between the pre and post-session survey, with an increase in
median from 3 (IQR = 2-3.5, n = 21) to 4 (IQR = 4-5, n = 21) (p < 0.05).
Respondents noted that the benefits of a hackathon were that it was very
engaging, and brought in diversity of thought and expertise. The
drawbacks to the hackathon were that it was fast-paced, required prior
knowledge and the virtual platform it was hosted on.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that hackathons are an effective,

Steering planetary and human health towards a more sustainable future
demands educated and prepared health professionals.
Aim
This research aimed: to explore health professions educators'
sustainable healthcare education (SHE) knowledge, attitudes,
self-efficacy and teaching practices across 13 health professions
courses in one Australian university.
Methods
Utilising a sequential mixed-methods design: Phase one (understanding)
involved an online survey to ascertain educators' SHE knowledge,
attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices to inform phase two
(solution generation), `Teach Green' Hackathon. Survey data was
descriptively analysed and a gap analysis performed to promote
generation of solutions during phase two. Results from the hackathon
were thematically analysed to produce five recommendations.
Results
Regarding SHE, survey data across 13 health professions disciplines (n =
163) identified strong content knowledge (90.8\%); however, only
(36.9\%) reported confidence to `explain' and (44.2\%) to `inspire'
students. Two thirds of participants (67.5\%) reported not knowing how
best to teach SHE. Hackathon data revealed three main influencing
factors: regulatory, policy and socio-cultural drivers.
Conclusions

Transferable knowledge and skills, and (3) Expectations about
hackathons. These themes highlight strengths and potential barriers when
bringing this multidisciplinary approach to high school students and the
healthcare community.
Conclusion: This study found that students were empowered by the
interdisciplinary experience during a hackathon and felt that the
knowledge and skills gained could be applied in real world settings.
However, addressing student expectations of hackathons prior to the
event is an area for improvement. These findings have implications for
future hackathons and can spur further research into using the hackathon
model as an educational experience for learners of all ages.","Lyndon, Mataroria P. and Cassidy, Michael P. and Celi, Leo Anthony and

``smart{''} cities","This paper investigates the opportunities of leveraging a hackathon
format to empower citizens by increasing their abilities to use open
data to improve their neighbourhoods and communities. The presented
discussion is grounded in five civic hackathon case studies organised in
five European cities. The research revealed specialised learning and
collaborative alignment as two mutually complementary aspects of the
involved learning processes, which were achieved with the help of
high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes, respectively. Consequently,
the paper identifies and discusses three main factors required to
sustain social learning ecosystems beyond hackathon events, and with the
purpose of democratising smart city services. These factors include a)
supporting individuals in obtaining specific expert knowledge and
skills, b) nurturing data-literate activist communities of practice made
up of citizens with complementary expert skillsets, and c) enabling
members of these communities to generate prototypes of open-data

article,Design at hackathons: new opportunities for design research,"Hackathons are short-term events at which participants work in small
groups to ideate, develop and present a solution to a problem. Despite
their popularity, and significant relevance to design research, they
have only recently come into research focus. This study presents a
review of the existing literature on the characteristics of designing at
hackathons. Hackathon participants are found to follow typical
divergence-convergence patterns in their design process throughout the
hackathon. Unique features include the initial effort to form teams and
the significant emphasis on preparing and delivering a solution demo at
the final pitch. Therefore, hackathons present themselves as a unique
setting in which design is conducted and learned, and by extension, can
be studied. Overall, the review provides a foundation to inform future
research on design at hackathons. Methodological limitations of current
studies on hackathons are discussed and the feasibility of more
systematic studies of design in these types of settings is assessed.
Further, we explore how the unique nature of the hackathon format and
the diverse profiles of hackathon participants with regards to subject

article,"Platform diffusion at temporary gatherings: Social coordination and
ecosystem emergence","Research Summary Software platforms create value by cultivating an
ecosystem of complementary products and services. Existing explanations
for how a prospective complementor chooses platforms to join assume the
complementor has rich information about the range of available
platforms. However, complementors lack this information in many
ecosystems, raising the question of how complementors learn about
platforms in the first place. We investigate whether attending a
temporary gathering-a hackathon-impacts the platform choices of software
developers. Through a large-scale quantitative study of 1,302 developers
and 167 hackathons, supported by qualitative research, we analyze the
multiple channels-sponsorship, social learning, knowledge exchange, and
social coordination-through which hackathons serve as a social forum for
the diffusion of platform adoption among attendees. Managerial Summary A
software platform such as Windows, iOS, or Amazon Web Services relies on
third-party developers to create applications that complement the
platform and make it valuable for end users. However, developers face a
wide range of possible platforms, and they may have limited information
about which platforms would be worthwhile to develop for. A software
platform business can educate and encourage developers to adopt their
platform by supporting in-person software development competitions,
known as hackathons. Developers learn about prospective platforms that
advertise at the hackathon. Developers also learn whether and how to use
a platform by observing and teaching one other. Hackathons are
particularly useful for spreading platform technologies: developers
prefer to adopt widely used platforms, and hackathons permit developers
to identify and join fashionable platforms.","Fang, Tommy Pan and Wu, Andy and Clough, David R.","complex contagions; hackathons; innovation ecosystems; multisided

nutrition. The Hackathon occurred in the sixth and seventh weeks of the
course; the last 4 weeks provided 10\% of class time for ITO projects.
All enrolled students participated in the pilot study (n = 6; M age =

changes in perspective (n = 7). Additionally, nontransformative changes
were found in confidence (n = 1), identity (n = 2), perspective (n = 4),
and skills (n = 9). This pilot work suggests that the Hackathon and ITO
contributed to perceived skill-building in problem-solving and teamwork,

study of medical students' perspectives","Objective Medical students, as clinicians and healthcare leaders of the
future, are key stakeholders in the clinical roll-out of artificial
intelligence-driven technologies. The authors aim to provide the first
report on the state of artificial intelligence in medical education
globally by exploring the perspectives of medical students. Methods The
authors carried out a mixed-methods study of focus groups and surveys
with 128 medical students from 48 countries. The study explored
knowledge around artificial intelligence as well as what students wished
to learn about artificial intelligence and how they wished to learn
this. A combined qualitative and quantitative analysis was used. Results
Support for incorporating teaching on artificial intelligence into core
curricula was ubiquitous across the globe, but few students had received
teaching on artificial intelligence. Students showed knowledge on the
applications of artificial intelligence in clinical medicine as well as
on artificial intelligence ethics. They were interested in learning
about clinical applications, algorithm development, coding and algorithm
appraisal. Hackathon-style projects and multidisciplinary education
involving computer science students were suggested for incorporation
into the curriculum. Conclusions Medical students from all countries
should be provided teaching on artificial intelligence as part of their
curriculum to develop skills and knowledge around artificial
intelligence to ensure a patient-centred digital future in medicine.
This teaching should focus on the applications of artificial
intelligence in clinical medicine. Students should also be given the
opportunity to be involved in algorithm development. Students in low-
and middle-income countries require the foundational technology as well
as robust teaching on artificial intelligence to ensure that they can
drive innovation in their healthcare settings.","Ejaz, Hamza and McGrath, Hari and Wong, Brian L. H. and Guise, Andrew

STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) disciplines to
be able to creatively approach and collaboratively address wicked
problems - complex problems with no ``right `` answer that span
disciplines. Hackathons are environments that leverage problem-based

collaboratively by developing a solution to given challenges using
engineering and computer science knowledge, skills, and abilities. The
purpose of this paper is to offer a framework for interdisciplinary
hackathon challenge development, as well as provide resources to aid
interdisciplinary teams in better understanding the context and needs of
a hackathon to evaluate and refine hackathon challenges. Three cohorts
of interdisciplinary STEAM researchers were observed and interviewed as
they collaboratively created a hackathon challenge incorporating all
cohort-member disciplines for an online high school hackathon. The
observation data and interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic
analysis to distill the processes cohorts underwent and resources that
were necessary for successfully creating a hackathon challenge. Through
this research we found that the cohorts worked through four sequential
stages as they collaborated to create a hackathon challenge. We detail
the stages and offer them as a framework for future teams who seek to
develop an interdisciplinary hackathon challenge. Additionally, we found
that all cohorts lacked the knowledge and experience with hackathons to
make fully informed decisions related to the challenge's topic, scope,

Education","Innovation is a crucial force underlying the organizational and societal
ability to survive and thrive in crisis times, especially in education.
However, not all challenges require creating novel solutions;
occasionally, combining pre-existing solutions-an approach known as the
mashup methodology-can provide equal benefit. Nevertheless, this
approach appears to be relatively unknown. In the current case study, we
provide an example of using a mashup of technologies to solve the
challenge of running a remote virtual hackathon under COVID-19 social
distancing regulations. Additionally, we argue that utilizing the mashup
is a form of modeling, in which students learn by witnessing its use.
Utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model, we show that by modeling the
use of the mashup methodology in this hackathon (Study 1-case), we
managed to improve students' attitudes towards the method and increase
its perceived usefulness and ease of use in their eyes. This, in turn,
raised their intention to use it as an innovation tool in the future.
Study 2 revealed that this effect on participants' intentions is more
significant than what would be achieved by merely teaching people about
the methodology. The results of these studies add to the growing

orientation behind student participation","The education sector is constantly progressing its competency paradigm
by establishing a nexus between practical, theoretical, and technical
dimensions of teaching and learning. In the modern age of education,
hackathons are becoming increasingly prominent in providing an optimal
academic environment that connects classroom learnings to real-life
scenarios. This study explored the motivational orientation behind
student participation in hackathons through the framework provided by
self-determination theory. Specifically, it investigated the role of
intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in encouraging initial and
continuous hackathon participation. The partial least squares-structural
equation modeling method was used to analyze data collected from 437
students in 12 countries. According to the findings, although intrinsic
motivation influences participation intention, extrinsic motivation
drives continuance participation. When intrinsic and extrinsic
motivational constructs were analyzed individually, it was found that
continuance participation demands both motivational orientations.
Comparisons of demographic characteristics indicate that older students
with more extensive educational experience may have higher intentions to
participate and continue participating in these events. This study
offers insights into how the education sector can increase hackathon
participation by tapping on students' motivational orientation. From a
methodological point of view, it is apparent to recommend the promotion
of hackathons as a core extracurricular activity at a school level, and
more indispensably, as pedagogy at a classroom level. In a world where

article,One-off events? An empirical study of hackathon code creation and reuse,"Context Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate
on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research
focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the
evolution of the hackathon code. Objective We aim to understand the
evolution of code used in and created during hackathon events, with a
particular focus on the code blobs, specifically, how frequently
hackathon teams reuse pre-existing code, how much new code they develop,
if that code gets reused afterwards, and what factors affect reuse.
Method We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from
Devpost and obtained related code blobs, authors, project
characteristics, original author, code creation time, language, and size
information from World of Code. We tracked the reuse of code blobs by
identifying all commits containing blobs created during hackathons and
identifying all projects that contain those commits. We also conducted a
series of surveys in order to gain a deeper understanding of hackathon
code evolution that we sent out to hackathon participants whose code was
reused, whose code was not reused, and developers who reused some
hackathon code. Result 9.14\% of the code blobs in hackathon
repositories and 8\% of the lines of code (LOC) are created during
hackathons and around a third of the hackathon code gets reused in other
projects by both blob count and LOC. The number of associated
technologies and the number of participants in hackathons increase reuse
probability. Conclusion The results of our study demonstrates hackathons

article,Characteristics of invention development during the hackathon,"The hackathon was developed by practitioners and it could be said that
they used structures and characteristics from other invention
development methods that intend to spark creativity. This paper aims to
define and evaluate those characteristics that serve as determinants of
invention. It analyses research performed on 14 different hackathons
with the following ethnographic approach: 1000 h of observation, 36
semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography (netnography).
Collected data has been analysed with the use of grounded theory methods
and machine learning, which has been introduced as a triangulation
method. As a result 9 main characteristics within the hackathon method
that serve as invention determinants were discovered and holistically
described. The identified elements have been backed by different
theoretical backgrounds, but as one they form a flexible and unique
mixture that helps to understand the hackathon phenomenon, potential
hazards and its inner mechanisms. The discovered characteristics can
help in effective organization of hackathons in the future.","Rys, Maciej","Creativity; determinants of invention; hackathon; invention; innovation;

Hackathon (MATDAT18) took place at the Residence Inn Alexandria Old
Town/Duke Street, Alexandria, VA over the period May 30-June 1, 2018.
This three-day collaborative ``hackathon{''} or ``datathon{''} brought
together teams of materials scientists and data scientists to
collaboratively engage materials science problems using data science
tools. The materials scientists brought a diversity of problems ranging
from inorganic material bandgap prediction to acceleration of ab initio
molecular dynamics to quantification of aneurysm risk from blood
hydrodynamics. The data scientists contributed tools and expertise in
areas such as deep learning, Gaussian process regression, and sequential
learning with which to engage these problems. Participants lived and
worked together, collaboratively ``hacked{''} for several hours per day,
delivered introductory, midpoint, and final presentations and were
exposed to presentations and informal interactions with NSF personnel.
Social events were organized to facilitate interactions between teams.
The primary outcomes of the event were to seed new collaborations
between materials and data scientists and generate preliminary results.
A separate competitive process enabled participants to apply for
exploratory funding to continue work commenced at the hackathon.

the temporary assistance was integrated in the educational process. As
shown by the results of the experimental learning, the second group,
where the IT students performed auxiliary roles and the duration of
scaffolding use was defined by both students and teachers, demonstrated
significantly better results than the first group, where the IT students
performed auxiliary roles and the duration of scaffolding use was
defined by IT students only. Scaffolding should be regulated by both the

article,"Application of MCAT questions as a testing tool and evaluation metric
for knowledge graph-based reasoning systems","``Knowledge graphs{''} (KGs) have become a common approach for
representing biomedical knowledge. In a KG, multiple biomedical data
sets can be linked together as a graph representation, with nodes
representing entities, such as ``chemical substance{''} or ``genes,{''}
and edges representing predicates, such as ``causes{''} or ``treats.{''}
Reasoning and inference algorithms can then be applied to the KG and
used to generate new knowledge. We developed three KG-based
question-answering systems as part of the Biomedical Data Translator
program. These systems are typically tested and evaluated using
traditional software engineering tools and approaches. In this study, we
explored a team-based approach to test and evaluate the prototype
``Translator Reasoners{''} through the application of Medical College
Admission Test (MCAT) questions. Specifically, we describe three
``hackathons,{''} in which the developers of each of the three systems
worked together with a moderator to determine whether the applications
could be used to solve MCAT questions. The results demonstrate
progressive improvement in system performance, with 0\% (0/5) correct
answers during the first hackathon, 75\% (3/4) correct during the second
hackathon, and 100\% (5/5) correct during the final hackathon. We
discuss the technical and sociologic lessons learned and conclude that
MCAT questions can be applied successfully in the context of moderated
hackathons to test and evaluate prototype KG-based question-answering
systems, identify gaps in current capabilities, and improve performance.

article,"Interdisciplinary Online Hackathons as an Approach to Combat the
COVID-19 Pandemic: Case Study","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the lives of millions of
people by causing a dramatic impact on many health care systems and the
global economy. This devastating pandemic has brought together
communities across the globe to work on this issue in an unprecedented
manner.
Objective: This case study describes the steps and methods employed in
the conduction of a remote online health hackathon centered on
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to deliver a clear
implementation road map for other organizations to follow.
Methods: This 4-day hackathon was conducted in April 2020, based on six
COVID-19-related challenges defined by frontline clinicians and
researchers from various disciplines. An online survey was structured to
assess: (1) individual experience satisfaction, (2) level of
interprofessional skills exchange, (3) maturity of the projects
realized, and (4) overall quality of the event. At the end of the event,
participants were invited to take part in an online survey with 17 (+5
optional) items, including multiple-choice and open-ended questions that
assessed their experience regarding the remote nature of the event and
their individual project, interprofessional skills exchange, and their
confidence in working on a digital health project before and after the
hackathon. Mentors, who guided the participants through the event, also
provided feedback to the organizers through an online survey.
Results: A total of 48 participants and 52 mentors based in 8 different
countries participated and developed 14 projects. A total of 75
mentorship video sessions were held. Participants reported increased
confidence in starting a digital health venture or a research project
after successfully participating in the hackathon, and stated that they
were likely to continue working on their projects. Of the participants
who provided feedback, 60\% (n=18) would not have started their project
without this particular hackathon and indicated that the hackathon
encouraged and enabled them to progress faster, for example, by building
interdisciplinary teams, gaining new insights and feedback provided by
their mentors, and creating a functional prototype.
Conclusions: This study provides insights into how online hackathons can
contribute to solving the challenges and effects of a pandemic in
several regions of the world. The online format fosters team diversity,
increases cross-regional collaboration, and can be executed much faster
and at lower costs compared to in-person events. Results on preparation,

Engineering Design Days","Contribution: This article defines ``curricular hackathons{''} and
describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the
hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience
implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students
with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and
integrative design problems.Background: Design is an essential part of
engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are
provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving
ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year
capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities
are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry
significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon
format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for
formative design practice.Research Question: How can the hackathon
format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology:
The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight
from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the
University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two
methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an
interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and
implementation.Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a
curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact
on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social
experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a
design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some
level of integration and/or embedding in a program's curriculum.","Rennick, Christopher and Litster, Greg and Hulls, C. C. W. and Hurst,

among men who have sex with men (MSM) is feasible in low- and
middle-income settings. However, many currently available mHealth tools
on the market were developed by the private sector for profit and have
limited input from MSM communities.
Objective: A health hackathon is an intensive contest that brings
together participants from multidisciplinary backgrounds to develop a
proposed solution for a specific health issue within a short period. The
purpose of this paper was to describe a hackathon event that aimed to
develop an mHealth tool to enhance health care (specifically HIV
prevention) utilization among Chinese MSM, summarize characteristics of
the final prototypes, and discuss implications for future mHealth
intervention development.
Methods: The hackathon took place in Guangzhou, China. An open call for
hackathon participants was advertised on 3 Chinese social media
platforms, including Blued, a popular social networking app among MSM.
All applicants completed a Web-based survey and were then scored. The
top scoring applicants were grouped into teams based on their skills and
content area expertise. Each team was allowed 1 month to prepare for the
hackathon. The teams then came together in person with on-site expert
mentorship for a 72-hour hackathon contest to develop and present
mHealth prototype solutions. The judging panel included experts in
psychology, public health, computer science, social media, clinical
medicine, and MSM advocacy. The final prototypes were evaluated based on
innovation, usability, and feasibility.
Results: We received 92 applicants, and 38 of them were selected to
attend the April 2019 hackathon. A total of 8 teams were formed,
including expertise in computer science, user interface design, business
or marketing, clinical medicine, and public health. Moreover, 24
participants self-identified as gay, and 3 participants self-identified
as bisexual. All teams successfully developed a prototype tool. A total
of 4 prototypes were designed as a mini program that could be embedded
within a popular Chinese social networking app, and 3 prototypes were
designed as stand-alone apps. Common prototype functions included
Web-based physician searching based on one's location (8 prototypes),
health education (4 prototypes), Web-based health counseling with
providers or lay health volunteers (6 prototypes), appointment
scheduling (8 prototypes), and between-user communication (2
prototypes). All prototypes included strategies to ensure privacy
protection for MSM users, and some prototypes offered strategies to
ensure privacy of physicians. The selected prototypes are undergoing

collaboration in medicine","BackgroundMedical students and healthcare professionals can benefit from
exposure to cross-disciplinary teamwork and core concepts of medical
innovation. Indeed, to address complex challenges in patient care,
diversity in collaboration across medicine, engineering, business, and
design is critical. However, a limited number of academic institutions
have established cross-disciplinary opportunities for students and young
professionals within these domains to work collaboratively towards
diverse healthcare needs.MethodsDrawing upon best practices from
computer science and engineering, healthcare hackathons bring together
interdisciplinary teams of students and professionals to collaborate,
brainstorm, and build solutions to unmet clinical needs. Over the course
of six months, a committee of 20 undergraduates, medical students, and
physician advisors organized Stanford University's first healthcare
hackathon (November 2016). Demographic data from initial applications
were supplemented with responses from a post-hackathon survey gauging
themes of diversity in collaboration, professional development, interest
in medical innovation, and educational value. In designing and
evaluating the event, the committee focused on measurable outcomes of
diversity across participants (skillset, age, gender, academic degree),
ideas (clinical needs), and innovations (projects).ResultsDemographic
data (n=587 applicants, n=257 participants) reveal participants across
diverse academic backgrounds, age groups, and domains of expertise were
in attendance. From 50 clinical needs presented representing 19 academic
fields, 40 teams ultimately formed and submitted projects spanning web
(n=13) and mobile applications (n=13), artificial intelligence-based
tools (n=6), and medical devices (n=3), among others. In post-hackathon
survey responses (n=111), medical students and healthcare professionals
alike noted a positive impact on their ability to work in
multidisciplinary teams, learn from individuals of different
backgrounds, and address complex healthcare
challenges.ConclusionsHealthcare hackathons can encourage diversity

subset consisting of 2953 SRA data sets (approximately 55 million
contigs) was selected, which were further filtered for a minimal length
of 1 kb. This resulted in 4.2 million (Mio) contigs, which were aligned
using BLAST against all known virus genomes, phylogenetically clustered
and assigned metadata. Out of the 4.2 Mio contigs, 360,000 contigs were
labeled with domains and an additional subset containing 4400 contigs
was screened for virus or virus-like genes. The work yielded valuable
insights into both SRA data and the cloud infrastructure required to
support such efforts, revealing analysis bottlenecks and possible
workarounds thereof. Mainly: (i) Conservative assemblies of SRA data
improves initial analysis steps; (ii) existing bioinformatic software
with weak multithreading/multicore support can be elevated by wrapper
scripts to use all cores within a computing node; (iii) redesigning
existing bioinformatic algorithms for a cloud infrastructure to
facilitate its use for a wider audience; and (iv) a cloud infrastructure
allows a diverse group of researchers to collaborate effectively. The
scientific findings will be extended during a follow-up event. Here, we
present the applied workflows, initial results, and lessons learned from
the hackathon.","Connor, Ryan and Brister, Rodney and Buchmann, Jan P. and Deboutte, Ward

article,A classification of Challenges encountered in Complex Teamwork Settings,"Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments may at
times become socio-emotionally tense and pose challenges that may have
detrimental effects on mutual trust and shared mental models. Objective.
This study aims to examine and classify general teamwork challenges in a
novel but authentic CSCL setting (hackathon) to identify challenges that
impede the development of key team coordination mechanisms (i.e., mutual
trust and shared mental models). Methods. Multimodal data including
responses to an adapted questionnaire (AIRE), post-competition interview
data, and videos of team interaction were collected during an
international hackathon event (N=48, 71\% male, M=22 years age).
Qualitative theory-driven coding and theme development were used to
analyze the multimodal dataset (Greeno, 2006; Jarvenoja et al., 2013).
Results. Our analyses revealed 16 general challenges that hamper
teamwork in a hackathon. A model of team challenges was developed to
categorize challenges into macro level themes including cognitive,
motivational, emotional and behavioral challenges. We also identified
which challenges hindered the development of mutual trust, and which
challenges hindered the development of shared mental models.
Conclusions. These findings provide important insights for educators and
mentors in understanding the types of teamwork challenges that may occur
in CSCL settings. The results also inform educators which challenges
likely lead to mutual trust breakdown and weaken shared mental model
bonds.","Kazemitabar, Maedeh A. and Lajoie, Susanne P. and Li, Tianshu","Cognitions; Emotions; Mutual trust; Shared mental models; Hackathon;

COVID-19 pandemic","PurposeThis study aims to document students' supply chain solutions
developed through the internship hackathon program. The study profiled
innovative solutions developed by university students in Kenya to solve
health supply chain logistics challenges during and beyond COVID-19.
This is done by exploring students' experience in developing sustainable
logistics and supply chain management capacity-building programs in a
low-middle-income country (LMIC). Design/methodology/approachThis study
used a qualitative approach to explore the experiences and perceptions
of students and mentors who participated in a hackathon program. The
study followed a cross-sectional descriptive survey design, collecting
data from the participants through online questionnaires. The data were
analyzed and presented using thematic analysis and narrative techniques.
FindingsFindings provide preliminary evidence for narrowing the gap
between theory and practice through a hackathon internship blended with
a mentorship program. Assessment of this program provides evidence for
developing solutions toward ensuring the availability of essential
medicine in LMICs during a pandemic such as COVID-19 by students. The
profiled solutions demonstrate a broader perspective of innovative
solutions of university students, mentors and potential opportunities
for a triple helix approach to innovation for health supply chain system
strengthening. Research limitations/implicationsThis original study
provides evidence for advancing contribution to developing innovative
solutions through partnerships between investors, universities and
industry practitioners interested in mentoring students in the
health-care supply chain during COVID-19 in LMICs. Specifically,
contingency factors that affect the implementation of innovative
programs during and beyond global pandemics such as COVID-19 by
students' innovators are identified, and implications for policy action
are discussed based on the praxis of sensemaking. Practical
implicationsThis study examines a novel approach that combines
internship, mentorship and hackathon projects for logistics and supply
chain students in LMICs. The approach aims to bridge the gap between
theory and practice and to create innovative solutions for essential
medicines during and after COVID-19. The study urges more resources for
supporting such programs, as they benefit both academia and industry.
The study also argues that hackathon internship programs can help the
logistics and supply chain industry adapt to the post-pandemic era. The
study offers insights for investors, universities and practitioners in
the health-care industry. Originality/valueThis study shows how to
develop innovative solutions for the health-care supply chain during
COVID-19 in an LMIC through partnerships between investors, universities

Stakeholders to Progress Conceptual Design of a Complex Engineered
Product","This paper describes a novel hackathon-style system engineering process
and its value as an agile approach to the rapid generation and
development of early design concepts of complex engineered products-in
this case a future aircraft. Complex product design typically requires a
diverse range of stakeholders to arrive at a consensus of key decision
criteria and design factors, which requires effective articulation and
communication of information across traditional engineering and
operational disciplines. The application of the methodology is
highlighted by means of a case study inspired by Airbus where
stakeholder involvement and internal collaboration among team members
were essential to achieve a set of agreed goals. This paper shows that a
hackathon grounded on systems engineering approaches and structured
around the technical functions within an engineering company has the
capability and capacity to communicate a coherent vision and rationale
for the conceptual design of a complex engineered product. The hackathon
method offers significant benefits to these stakeholders to better
manage, prioritize, and decrease excessive complexities in the overall
design process. A significant benefit of this agile process is that it
can achieve useful results in a very short timeframe (i.e., 80\%
reduction), where it could take up to a year to accomplish compared with
using current/regular internal methods.","Saravi, S. and Joannou, D. and Kalawsky, R. S. and King, M. R. N. and

patients in structured and unstructured routine care data: results from
a hackathon","Background The new concept of difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis
(D2T RA) refers to RA patients who remain symptomatic after several
lines of treatment, resulting in a high patient and economic burden.
During a hackathon, we aimed to identify and predict D2T RA patients in
structured and unstructured routine care data. Methods Routine care data
of 1873 RA patients were extracted from the Utrecht Patient Oriented
Database. Data from a previous cross-sectional study, in which 152 RA
patients were clinically classified as either D2T or non-D2T, served as
a validation set. Machine learning techniques, text mining, and feature
importance analyses were performed to identify and predict D2T RA
patients based on structured and unstructured routine care data. Results
We identified 123 potentially new D2T RA patients by applying the D2T RA
definition in structured and unstructured routine care data.
Additionally, we developed a D2T RA identification model derived from a
feature importance analysis of all available structured data (AUC-ROC
0.88 (95\% CI 0.82-0.94)), and we demonstrated the potential of
longitudinal hematological data to differentiate D2T from non-D2T RA
patients using supervised dimension reduction. Lastly, using data up to
the time of starting the first biological treatment, we predicted future
development of D2TRA (AUC-ROC 0.73 (95\% CI 0.71-0.75)). Conclusions
During this hackathon, we have demonstrated the potential of different
techniques for the identification and prediction of D2T RA patients in

expertise. Global surgery is an emerging field with a huge burden of
disease and massive implications for bettering health care. In this
study, we describe the first Global Surgery Hackathon held in Pakistan
and analyze the impacts of the hack and post-hack incubation. Methods.
This research study used data collected from a Hackathon held at the Aga
Khan University (AKU) in Karachi, Pakistan, and progress from the
post-hack incubation teams. Data were collected from applications, from
sign-in attendance, via evaluation forms, and milestone tracking of the
incubation teams. A list of factors such as sectors addressed by winning
projects and grants received was made. Results. The evaluations provided
by the participants were positive, with mean scores of 4.00 (SD = .78)

participants were sorted into 5 categories: workplace, access, quality,
safety, and design. Fifteen teams were formed, out of which 5 were
accepted for incubation. All teams had a minimum viable product at the

Iceland conveyed through the implementation and perceived outcomes of
the hackathon Hacking Hekla. Digitalisation is often proposed as a new,
all-purpose tool for regional development that responds to rural
challenges innovatively. However, the digital role is often less clear
when examining finer development practices. Hackathons are frequently
applied to achieve instant economic and societal change. Through the
example of Hacking Hekla, we research the challenges and outcomes of
creative interventions and critically explore the value of innovation
and digitalisation in the context of rural development in Iceland. Based
on action research, we use the hackathon as a tool for knowledge
generation and intervention in regional policy discourse with the
intention to foster applied digital innovation. Data were collected

DesignShop Design Thinking Workshop","Education in America can benefit from innovation. Inventive thinking
from a diverse array of people and experiences can help redefine and
reinvent this important public mission. Hackathons are collaborative,
short sprints that offer such collaboration opportunities. While usually
coding marathons, hackathon-type events like the Education DesignShop
have been developed to address broad, systemic issues, tools, and
processes from design thinking. Two research questions are explored: How
do non-designers transform into design thinkers? and How do educational
projects address systemic changes? The Education DesignShop introduced
new ways to collaborate and form sustainable solutions. Eight key
structural components are identified around just-in-time modules
teaching design thinking in an educational context. Projects from the
Education DesignShop show a larger number of designerly attributes and
are farther along Anderson's Continuum of Systemic Change. Policy

a case study of Scandic hotels","Education for sustainability (EfS) in the hospitality sector is
increasingly recognised as one of the driving forces for sustainable
development. One way of fostering sustainability in the hospitality
industry is through sustainability hackathons, which are intensive

bridge publication and data gaps across world regions are still unclear.
To address this issue, we conducted a hackathon at the Society for the
Improvement of Psychological Science 2021 conference to develop
guidelines to improve international representation of authors and
participants, adapted for various stakeholders in the production of
psychological knowledge. Based on this hackathon, we discuss specific

article,"Hackathons as Stepping Stones in Health Care Innovation: Case Study With
Systematic Recommendations","Background: Until recently, developing health technologies was
time-consuming and expensive, and often involved patients, doctors, and
other health care professionals only as passive recipients of the end
product. So far, users have been minimally involved in the ideation and
creation stages of digital health technologies. In order to best address
users' unmet needs, a transdisciplinary and user-led approach, involving
cocreation and direct user feedback, is required. In this context,
hackathon events have become increasingly popular in generating
enthusiasm for user-centered innovation.
Objective: This case study describes preparatory steps and the
performance of a health hackathon directly involving patients and health
care professionals at all stages. Feasibility and outcomes were
assessed, leading to the development of systematic recommendations for
future hackathons as a vehicle for bottom-up innovation in health care.
Methods: A 2-day hackathon was conducted in February 2017 in Berlin,
Germany. Data were collected through a field study. Collected field
notes were subsequently discussed in 15 informal meetings among the
research team. Experiences of conducting two further hackathons in
December 2017 and November 2018 were included.
Results: In total, 30 participants took part, with 63\% (19/30) of
participants between 25 and 34 years of age, 30\% (9/30) between 35 and
44 years of age, and 7\% (2/30) younger than 25 years of age. A total of
43\% (13/30) of the participants were female. The participation rate of
medical experts, including patients and health care professionals, was
30\% (9/30). Five multidisciplinary teams were formed and each tackled a
specific health care problem. All presented projects were apps: a
chatbot for skin cancer recognition, an augmented reality exposure-based
therapy (eg, for arachnophobia), an app for medical neighborhood
connectivity, a doctor appointment platform, and a self-care app for
people suffering from depression. Patients and health care professionals
initiated all of the projects. Conducting the hackathon resulted in
significant growth of the digital health community of Berlin and was
followed up by larger hackathons. Systematic recommendations for
conducting cost-efficient hackathons (n <= 30) were developed, including
aspects of community building, stakeholder engagement, mentoring,
themes, announcements, follow-up, and timing for each step.
Conclusions: This study shows that hackathons are effective in bringing
innovation to health care and are more cost- and time-efficient and
potentially more sustainable than traditional medical device and digital
product development. Our systematic recommendations can be useful to
other individuals and organizations that want to establish user-led
innovation in academic hospitals by conducting transdisciplinary
hackathons.","Poncette, Akira-Sebastian and Rojas, Pablo-David and Hofferbert, Joscha

Comparison of best and worst teams","Research has demonstrated the power of emotion regulation in managing
challenges students face in different learning contexts. However,
emotion research in team-learning where challenges become more evident
is yet in its infancy. The current study examines case studies of two
teams (high and low performing) in a hackathon where the task involved
building a novel computer program to demonstrate a physics phenomenon;
and explores how shared emotion regulation impacts teamwork and the
types of challenges teams face (e.g., different goals/priorities;
unreliable members; emotional imbalance; being off track, inefficient
communication). Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyze team
interactions in terms of emotion regulation strategies student teams
apply and the challenge types/levels they encounter. Comparative
excerpts as well as descriptive statistics based on video data of
student interactions, interview inputs, and responses to several
questionnaires are provided to show differences among the cases. The
team with higher shared emotional regulation mainly had external
challenges that were less frustrating and demanding than relational
challenges, while the team with lower shared regulation had internal
challenges as well as external challenges and thus performed poorly. Our
findings showed that when team members apply shared emotion regulation
strategies, they build a cohesive atmosphere and synergistic team
relationships that enable them to contribute to the overall team goals.
This study also has implications for assisting educational teams in
challenging environments. We hope that our paper will generate new ways
of understanding and seeing shared emotion regulation in team settings.","Kazemitabar, Maedeh and Lajoie, Susanne P. and Doleck, Tenzin","Hackathons; Computer programming competitions; Emotion regulation;

article,"Global Leaders for Global Teams: Leaders with Multicultural Experiences
Communicate and Lead More Effectively, Especially in Multinational Teams","In an era of globalization, it is commonly assumed that multicultural
experiences foster leadership effectiveness. However, little research
has systematically tested this assumption. We develop a theoretical
perspective that articulates how and when multicultural experiences
increase leadership effectiveness. We hypothesize that broad
multicultural experiences increase individuals' leadership effectiveness
by developing their communication competence. Because communication
competence is particularly important for leading teams that are more
multinational, we further hypothesize that individuals with broader
multicultural experiences are particularly effective when leading more
versus less multinational teams. Four studies test our theory using
mixed methods (field survey, archival panel, field experiments) and
diverse populations (corporate managers, soccer managers, hackathon
leaders) in different countries (Australia, Britain, China, America). In
Study 1, corporate managers with broader multicultural experiences were
rated as more effective leaders, an effect mediated by communication
competence. Analyzing a 25-year archival panel of English Premier League
soccer managers, Study 2 replicates the positive effect of broad
multicultural experiences using a team performance measure of leadership
effectiveness. Importantly, this effect was moderated by team national
diversity: soccer managers with broader multicultural experiences were
particularly effective when leading teams with greater national
diversity. Study 3 (digital health hackathon) and Study 4 (COVID-19
policy hackathon) replicate these effects in two field experiments, in
which individuals with varying levels of multicultural experiences were
randomly assigned to lead hackathon teams that naturally varied in
national diversity. Overall, our research suggests that broad

lead more effectively, especially when leading multinational teams.","Lu, Jackson G. and Swaab, Roderick I. and Galinsky, Adam D.","globalization; culture; diversity; multicultural experiences;

skills after using authentic, online learning modules on hydrology and
water resources","The need to adapt quickly to online or remote instruction has been a
challenge for instructors during the COVID pandemic. A common issue
instructors face is finding high-quality curricular materials that can
enhance student learning by engaging them in solving complex, real-world
problems. The current study evaluates a set of 15 web-based learning
modules that promote the use of authentic, high-cognitive demand tasks.
The modules were developed collaboratively by a group of instructors
during a HydroLearn hackathon-workshop program. The modules cover
various topics in hydrology and water resources, including physical
hydrology, hydraulics, climate change, groundwater flow and quality,
fluid mechanics, open channel flow, remote sensing, frequency analysis,
data science, and evapotranspiration. The study evaluates the impact of
the modules on students' learning in terms of two primary aspects:
understanding of fundamental concepts and improving technical skills.
The study uses a practical instrument to measure students' perceived
changes in concepts and technical skills known as the Student Assessment
of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. The survey was used at two-time points
in this study: before the students participated in the module (pre) and
at the conclusion of the module (post). The surveys were modified to
capture the concepts and skills aligned with the learning objectives of
each module. We calculated the learning gains by examining differences
in students' self-reported understanding of concepts and skills from
pre- to post-implementation on the SALG using paired samples t-tests.
The majority of the findings were statistically at the 0.05 level and
practically significant. As measured by effect size, practical
significance is a means for identifying the strength of the conclusions
about a group of differences or the relationship between variables in a
study. The average effect size in educational research is d = 0.4. The
effect sizes from this study {[}0.45, 1.54] suggest that the modules
play an important role in supporting students' gains in conceptual

understanding design effort-influencing factors (objective
considerations that are universally accepted to exert influence on a

All finalists were invited to attend a 1day online civic hackathon.
Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the
post-COVID world=76; youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17; youth-led
social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused
on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon
provided the participants mentorship for further development of their
ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication
campaigns and improved social innovations.
Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response
to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth
voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation
call is recommended.","Ulitin, Allan and Mier-Alpano, Jana Deborah and Labarda, Meredith and

for virtual teams to share knowledge among their team members and

lens, the current study investigates how social media affordances affect
individual evaluations of TMS development and perceived team
effectiveness in virtual teams. Survey data from 339 virtual team
members across 92 hackathon events reveal that types of affordances have
differing impacts on each of the three dimensions of TMS (perceptions of
accuracy, sharedness, and validation). Furthermore, each dimension of
perceived TMS mediates the relationship between its related social media
affordance types and perceived team effectiveness. These findings
suggest that virtual teams may need to adopt different social media

Naturalistic Driving Data","On October 16th, 2017, in Yokohama, Japan, from 8:00 to 18:00, the first
Intelligent Transportation Systems plus Data Mining challenge was
organized under the umbrella of the 2017 IEEE Intelligent Transportation
Systems Conference, the flagship conference of the IEEE Intelligent
Transportation Systems Society. This activity was organized thanks to a
three way collaboration between the ITS Society, Nagoya University, and
the IEEE ITSC 2017 organizers. The twenty-three contestants, coming from
eleven different countries, faced a classic Naturalistic Driving
problem: Lane Departure detection.
This paper presents the three best solutions produced. The solutions
submitted by most of the participants were very diverse and interesting,
but overall, the top ones concurred in the use of ensemble learning
after a very interesting feature engineering phase. This hackathon
formulation was complex in several ways. It was complex in terms of
class imbalance, the challenge time duration and the fact that the
provided dataset included only numerical measurements coming from the
inertial unit in the testing car. That restriction made it difficult to
expect outstanding results - the best one was only slightly over 3\%
above baseline. However, the organizers thought that such complexities
pushed participants to show their repertoire as data scientists, taking
into consideration for example computer power load of the different
algorithms tested, and overall yielding more interesting approaches to
share with the community. Additionally, the most interesting learned
lessons were shared, from both an organizational and technical point of
view.","Alekseenko, Andrey and Dang, Hien Q. and Bansal, Gaurav and

article,"Learning Models for Traumatic Brain Injury Mortality Prediction on
Pediatric Electronic Health Records","BackgroundTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of
injury related mortality in the world, with severe cases reaching
mortality rates of 30-40\%. It is highly heterogeneous both in causes
and consequences, complicating medical interpretation and prognosis.
Gathering clinical, demographic, and laboratory data to perform a
prognosis requires time and skill in several clinical specialties.
Machine learning (ML) methods can take advantage of the data and guide
physicians toward a better prognosis and, consequently, better
healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop and test a wide
range of machine learning models and evaluate their capability of
predicting mortality of TBI, at hospital discharge, while assessing the
similarity between the predictive value of the data and clinical
significance. MethodsThe used dataset is the Hackathon Pediatric
Traumatic Brain Injury (HPTBI) dataset, composed of electronic health
records containing clinical annotations and demographic data of 300
patients. Four different classification models were tested, either with
or without feature selection. For each combination of the classification
model and feature selection method, the area under the receiver operator
curve (ROC-AUC), balanced accuracy, precision, and recall were
calculated. ResultsMethods based on decision trees perform better when
using all features (Random Forest, AUC = 0.86 and XGBoost, AUC = 0.91)
but other models require prior feature selection to obtain the best
results (k-Nearest Neighbors, AUC = 0.90 and Artificial Neural Networks,
AUC = 0.84). Additionally, Random Forest and XGBoost allow assessing the
feature's importance, which could give insights for future strategies on
the clinical routine. ConclusionPredictive capability depends greatly on
the combination of model and feature selection methods used but,
overall, ML models showed a very good performance in mortality
prediction for TBI. The feature importance results indicate that
predictive value is not directly related to clinical significance.","Fonseca, Joao and Liu, Xiuyun and Oliveira, Helder P. and Pereira, Tania","machine learning; feature selection; feature importance; Traumatic Brain

about new capabilities in iCn3D for analyzing the interactions between
amino acids in the paratopes of antibodies with amino acids in the
epitopes of antigens and predicting the effects of mutations on binding.
Additionally, new sequence alignment tools in iCn3D support aligning
protein sequences with sequences in structure models. We used these
methods to create a new undergraduate research project, that students
could perform online as part of a course, by combining the use of new
features in iCn3D with analysis tools in NextStrain, and a data set of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We present results from an example project
to illustrate how students would investigate the likelihood of
SARS-CoV-2 variants escaping from commercial antibodies and use chemical
interaction data to support their hypotheses. We also demonstrate that
online tools (iCn3D, NextStrain, and the NCBI databases) can be used to
carry out the necessary steps and that this work satisfies the

hackathons are gaining more attention in innovation management. However,
within the design domain such activities are often considered as a way
for mass generation of ideas, rather than processes for developing
proper design solutions. Information acquisition, gaining sufficient

collective design. In this study we applied three strategies of rapid
design, informed participation, and knowledge sharing to overcome these
challenges. During a one- week design hackathon, we conducted a
collective design project in which three teams of participants conducted
autoethnography research, shared their findings by an idea crowdsourcing
platform, and tested their 3D printed prototypes with potential users.
Although the tests showed efficiency of rapid design and informed

article,Mining citizen emotions to estimate the urgency of urban issues,"Crowdsourcing technology offers exciting possibilities for local
governments. Specifically, citizens are increasingly taking part in
reporting and discussing issues related to their neighborhood and
problems they encounter on a daily basis, such as overflowing trashbins,
broken footpaths and lifts, illegal graffiti, and potholes. Pervasive
citizen participation enables local governments to respond more
efficiently to these urban issues. This interaction between citizens and
municipalities is largely promoted by civic engagement platforms, such
as See-Click-Fix, FixMyStreet, CitySourced, and OpenIDEO, which allow
citizens to report urban issues by entering free text describing what
needs to be done, fixed or changed. In order to develop appropriate
action plans and priorities, government officials need to figure out how
urgent are the reported issues. In this paper we propose to estimate the
urgency of urban issues by mining different emotions that are implicit
in the text describing the issue. More specifically, a reported issue is
first categorized according to the emotions expressed in it, and then
the corresponding emotion scores are combined in order to produce a
final urgency level for the reported issue. Our experiments use the
SeeClickFix hackathon data and diverse emotion classification
algorithms. They indicate that (i) emotions can be categorized
efficiently with supervised learning algorithms, and (ii) the use of
citizen emotions leads to accurate urgency estimates. Further, using
additional features such as the type of issue or its author leads to no
further accuracy gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Masdeval, Christian and Veloso, Adriano",Emotion classification; Networked citizenship; Crowdsourcing,10.1016/j.is.2015.06.008,2015,9

issue for the management of open innovation. Insufficient compensation
for created value may hinder the participation of a firm or individual

for studying value appropriation in open innovation by actors of
different types and with varying bargaining power. We define hackathons
as idea competitions on specific topics in the form of a time-limited

years and have recently become more prominent. Therefore, an abductive
empirical study was carried out in an international set-up with multiple
embedded cases of hackathons. Results indicate that hackathons offer
coupled open innovation processes. The value captured by the initiator
of a hackathon in the form of inbound open innovation is balanced by
outbound knowledge flows towards participants as well as with sideways
knowledge flows between participants, which are a result of the
generation of collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is thus

water-deficient region. Ironically, the Gulf States count among the few
places with the highest per capita water consumption and low tariff.
Since a few decades ago, seawater desalination has been the most
reliable source of portable water in the Gulf. Recently, many critical
scholars raise concerns about the rising levels of brine discharge,
effects of water intake and outfall systems infrastructure, plants' high
energy consumption and fragmented regulatory and policy frameworks. In
this study, we explore the potentials of environmental governance in
addressing sustainability risks of seawater desalination projects. The
DPSIR model and the Earth system governance framework guided and
supported our analysis of several multidimensional issues that underlie
the characteristics of this industry. Thus, we identified 29 cause and
effect factors as well as nine environmental governance intervention
strategies. The study suggests that the industry's network of
stakeholders can develop good ideas for fostering sustainability by
using innovative tools such as hackathon-an interdisciplinary,
participatory, solution-oriented, and consensus building platform.
Finally, this study enjoins policymakers, businesses, and scientists to
embrace more transparent, practical and holistic ideas in designing,
executing and assessing technological innovations and interventions in
national and regional water security initiatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

article,"Assessing accessibility: an instrumental case study of a community music
group","Creating accessible events is a pressing issue for many music
organisations. In the United States, the term accessibility has strong
ties to disability, and it is an important concept because what is
deemed accessible directly impacts who is included and excluded from
music experiences. Music Community Lab (MCL) runs a series of events in
New York City called Monthly Music Hackathon NYC. They aim to promote
`diversity across backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities'. This
instrumental case study sought to examine how MCL participants
conceptualise accessibility as well as analyze participants' suggestions
for improving the accessibility of MCL events. Sixty-two people who
attended one of three MCL events completed a demographic survey and 57
of those respondents participated in an interview. Findings reveal that
63\% (n = 36) of participants associated accessibility with inclusivity
and 35\% (n = 20) of participants associated accessibility with ease of
access to resources, places, and experiences. Participants' suggestions
for improving accessibility included social media marketing (n = 23;
40\%) and ease of access approaches (n = 11; 19\%) including CART, ASL,
and live streaming events. Accessibility is challenging for community
music groups like MCL to navigate because it is a complex construct with
varied interpretations.","Bell, Adam Patrick and Datoo, Atiya and Matterson, Brent and Bahhadi,

article,"Multi-faceted informatics system for digitising and streamlining the
reablement care model","Reablement is new paradigm to increase independence in the home amongst
the ageing population. And it remains a challenge to design an optimal
electronic system to streamline and integrate reablement into current
healthcare infrastructure. Furthermore, given reablement requires
collaboration with a range of organisations (including national
healthcare institutions and community/voluntary service providers), such
a system needs to be co-created with all stakeholders involved. Thus,
the purpose of this study is, (1) to bring together stakeholder groups
to elicit a comprehensive set of requirements for a digital reablement
system, (2) to utilise emerging technologies to implement a system and a
data model based on the requirements gathered and (3) to involve user
groups in a usability assessment of the system. In this study we
employed a mixed qualitative approach that included a series of
stakeholder-involved activities. Collectively, 73 subjects were
recruited to participate in an ideation event, a quasi-hackathon and a
usability study. The study unveiled stakeholder-led requirements, which
resulted in a novel cloud-based system that was created using emerging
web technologies. The system is driven by a unique data model and
includes interactive features that are necessary for streamlining the
reablement care model. In summary, this system allows community based
interventions (or services) to be prescribed to occupants whilst also
monitoring the occupant's progress of independent living. (C) 2015

article,Crowdsourcing Team Formation With Worker-Centered Modeling,"Modern crowdsourcing offers the potential to produce solutions for
increasingly complex tasks requiring teamwork and collective labor.
However, the vast scale of the crowd makes forming project teams an
intractable problem to coordinate manually. To date, most crowdsourcing
collaborative platforms rely on algorithms to automate team formation
based on worker profiling data and task objectives. As a top-down
strategy, algorithmic crowd team formation tends to alienate workers
causing poor collaboration, interpersonal clashes, and dissatisfaction.
In this paper, we investigate different ways that crowd teams can be
formed through three team formation models namely bottom-up, top-down,
and hybrid. By simulating an open collaboration scenario such as a
hackathon, we observe that the bottom-up model forms the most
competitive teams with the highest teamwork quality. Furthermore, we
note that bottom-up approaches are particularly suitable for populations
with high-risk appetites (most workers being lenient toward exploring
new team configurations) and high degrees of homophily (most workers
preferring to work with similar teammates). Our study highlights the
importance of integrating worker agency in algorithm-mediated team
formation systems, especially in collaborative/competitive settings, and
bears practical implications for large-scale crowdsourcing platforms.","Vinella, Federica Lucia and Hu, Jiayuan and Lykourentzou, Ioanna and

Controlled Trial Using the Hackathon Format","Background: Mapping out the research landscape around a project is often
time consuming and difficult.
Objective: This study evaluates a commercial artificial intelligence
(AI) search engine (IRIS.AI ) for its applicability in an automated
literature search on a specific medical topic.
Methods: To evaluate the AI search engine in a standardized manner, the
concept of a science hackathon was applied. Three groups of researchers
were tasked with performing a literature search on a clearly defined
scientific project. All participants had a high level of expertise for
this specific field of research. Two groups were given access to the AI
search engine IRIS.AI . All groups were given the same amount of time
for their search and were instructed to document their results. Search
results were summarized and ranked according to a predetermined scoring

article,Iterative Coordination and Innovation: Prioritizing Value over Novelty,"An innovating organization faces the challenge of how to prioritize
distinct goals of novelty and value, both of which underlie innovation.
Popular practitioner frameworks like Agile management suggest that
organizations can adopt an iterative approach of frequent-meetings to
prioritize between these goals, a practice we refer to as iterative
coordination. Despite iterative coordination's widespread use in
innovation management, its effects on novelty and value in innovation
remain unknown. With the information technology firm Google, we embed a
field experiment within a hackathon software development competition to
identify the effect of iterative coordination on innovation. We find
that iterative coordination causes firms to implicitly prioritize value
in innovation: Although iteratively coordinating firms develop more
valuable products, these products are simultaneously less novel.
Furthermore, by tracking software code, we find that iteratively
coordinating firms favor integration at the cost of knowledge-creating
specialization. A follow-on laboratory study documents that increasing
the frequency and opportunities to reprioritize goals in iterative
coordination meetings reinforces value and integration, while reducing
novelty and specialization. This article offers three key contributions:
highlighting how processes to prioritize among multiple performance
goals may implicitly favor certain outcomes; introducing a new empirical
methodology of software code version tracking for measuring the
innovation process; and leveraging the emergent phenomenon of hackathons
to study new methods of organizing.","Ghosh, Sourobh and Wu, Andy","innovation; novelty; value; organizations; goals; integration;

article,"Development of an online research platform for use in a large-scale
multicentre study","Participation in research in beneficial but can be challenging at a
participant, clinician and organisation level. A novel online
recruitment and data collection platform has been designed to improve
accessibility to research and reduce the burden for participants and
centres. The pilot study has demonstrated the platform to be feasible,
acceptable to patients and accurate. Useful template when resources
limited.
Background Participation in research can be beneficial for patients and
healthcare providers, but may prove demanding at patient, clinician and
organizational levels. Patient representatives are supportive of online
research to overcome these challenges. The aim of this pilot study was
to develop an online recruitment platform and test its feasibility and
acceptability while evaluating the accuracy of participant-reported
data.
Methods The online research platform was developed in a 1-day
`hackathon' with a digital design company. Women who underwent
implant-based breast reconstruction in 2011-2016 were invited by letter
containing the web address (URL) of the study site and their unique
study number. Once online, participants learned about the study,
consented, entered data on demographics, treatment received and
patient-reported outcome measures (BREAST-Q (TM)), and booked an
appointment for a single hospital visit for three-dimensional surface
imaging (3D-SI). Real-time process evaluation was performed. The primary
endpoint was recruitment rate.
Results The recruitment rate was 40 per cent. Of the 100 women, 50
logged on to the platform and 40 completed the process through to 3D-SI.
The majority of discontinuations after logging on occurred between
consenting and entering demographics (3 women, 6 per cent), and between
completing the BREAST-Q and booking an appointment for 3D-SI using the
online calendar (3 women, 6 per cent). All women completed the online
BREAST-Q (TM) once started. Participants took a median of 23 minutes to
complete the online process. Patient-reported clinical data were
accurate in 12 of 13 domains compared with electronic records (95 per
cent concordance). Process evaluation demonstrated acceptability.
Conclusion The results of this pilot demonstrate the online platform to
be acceptable, feasible, and accurate for this population from a single
institution. The low-burden design may enable participation from centres
with less research support and participants from hard-to-reach groups or
dispersed geographical locations, but with online access.","Godden, A. R. and Micha, A. and Pitches, C. and Barry, P. A. and Krupa,

article,<i>EviAtlas</i>: a tool for visualising evidence synthesis databases,"Systematic mapping assesses the nature of an evidence base, answering
how much evidence exists on a particular topic. Perhaps the most useful
outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and

rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis method,
there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing
interactive visualisations of systematic map databases. In April 2018,
as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis
Hackathon in Stockholm, we decided to address this issue by developing
an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use) and
Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible)
tool for producing interactive, attractive tables and figures that
summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes
the ability to generate vital visualisations for systematic maps and
reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit
geographical information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that
cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of studies
belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing
the nature of the evidence base, for example the number of studies
published per year or number of studies per country. We believe that

images and clinical metadata aiming at accuracy and explainability","In the past few years COVID-19 posed a huge threat to healthcare systems

Italy severely resulting in high casualties and in the near breakdown of
primary care. Due to these facts, the Covid CXR Hackathon-Artificial
Intelligence for Covid-19 prognosis: aiming at accuracy and

our techniques at correctly diagnosing chest X-ray images collected upon
admission for severity of COVID-19 outcome. In addition to X-ray
imagery, clinical metadata was provided and the challenge also aimed at
creating an explainable model. We created a best-performing, as well as,
an explainable model that makes an effort to map clinical metadata to
image features whilst predicting the prognosis. We also did many
ablation studies in order to identify crucial parts of the models and
the predictive power of each feature in the datasets. We conclude that
CXRs at admission do not help the predicting power of the metadata
significantly by itself and contain mostly information that is also
mutually present in the blood samples and other clinical factors
collected at admission.","Olar, Alex and Biricz, Andras and Bedohazi, Zsolt and Sulyok, Bendeguz

article,Inter-Model Comparison for Tsunami Debris Simulation,"Assessing the risk of tsunami-driven debris has increasingly been
recognized as an important design consideration. The recent ASCE/SEI7-16
standard Chapter 6 requires all the areas included within a 22.5.
spreading angle from the debris source to consider the debris impact.
However, it would be more reasonable to estimate the risks using
numerical simulation models. Although a number of simulation models to
predict tsunami debris transport have been proposed individually,
comparative studies for these simulation models have rarely been
conducted. Thus, in the present study, an inter-model comparison for
tsunami debris simulation model was performed as a part of the virtual
Tsunami Hackathon held in Japan from September 1 to 3 in 2020. The blind
benchmarking experiment, which recorded the transport of three container
models under a tsunami-like bore, was conducted to generate a unique
dataset. Then, four different numerical models were applied to reproduce
the experiments. Simulated results demonstrated considerable differences
among the simulation models. Essentially, the importance of accurate
modelling of a flow field, especially a tsunami front, was confirmed to
be important in simulating debris motion. Parametric studies performed
in each model and comparisons between different models also confirmed
that a drag coefficient and inertia coefficient would influence the
simulated debris trajectory and velocity. It was also shown that two-way
coupled modelling to express the interaction between debris and a
tsunami is important to accurately model the debris motion.","Takabatake, Tomoyuki and Stolle, Jacob and Hiraishi, Koji and Kihara,

article,"Transactive Memory Systems, Temporary Teams, and Conflict:
Innovativeness During a Hackathon","The transactive memory system has been studied extensively, yet we still
know little about how it influences the effectiveness of temporary
teams. Additionally, little is known about the boundary conditions of
the well-established benefits of transactive memory systems on team
performance. Our primary goal in this study is to build and test a
theory that investigates the influence of a transactive memory system on
the performance of temporary teams while accounting for conditional
effects of both task and relationship conflict. On the surface, a
transactive memory systems perspective may seem incompatible with
temporary teams. Transactive memory systems typically require time or
team member familiarity to develop. However, team members on temporary
teams often are selected because of their expertise, not team member
familiarity, and often must quickly and effectively operate under time
and outcome pressures. We present a theory that suggests transactive
memory systems should have a meaningful influence on temporary teams,
and its effect is accentuated in the presence of task conflict and
attenuated in the presence of relationship conflict. We test our theory
using a sample of 202 teams participating in the Global Game Jam, the
world's largest hackathon devoted to designing and developing games
within a 48-h period. In addition to implications for literatures on
transactive memory systems and temporary teams, our study adds to a

article,VARMAN: Multi-plane security framework for software defined networks,"In the context of future networking technologies, Software-Defined
paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic
orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable
control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN
operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities,
security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture
itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data
centers, we propose a collaborative ``Network Security and Intrusion
Detection System(NIDS){''} scheme called ``VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne
secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks'. The SDN security
scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the
dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric
DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained
hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It
is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of
NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory
requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these
problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid
model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are
implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack
prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering,
feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the
practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters,
we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset,
and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of
normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by
organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network
hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is
capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98\%
under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller
interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70\% on an
average, and controller response time reduces by 40\%, without incurring
additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in
SDN stack. The comparisons of VARMAN under similar attack scenarios and
test environment, with related recent works that utilized ML-based NIDS,
demonstrate that our scheme offers higher accuracy, less than 5\% false
positive rate for various attack intensities and significant training

article,Entrofy your cohort: A transparent method for diverse cohort selection,"Selecting a cohort from a set of candidates is a common task within and
beyond academia. Admitting students, awarding grants, and choosing
speakers for a conference are situations where human biases may affect
the selection of any particular candidate, and, thereby the composition
of the final cohort. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,entrofy,
designed to be part of a human-in-the-loop decision making strategy
aimed at making cohort selection as just, transparent, and accountable
as possible. We suggest embeddingentrofyin a two-step selection
procedure. During a merit review, the committee selects all applicants,
submissions, or other entities that meet their merit-based criteria.
This often yields a cohort larger than the admissible number. In the
second stage, the target cohort can be chosen from this meritorious pool
via a new algorithm and software tool calledentrofy.entrofyoptimizes
differences across an assignable set of categories selected by the human
committee. Criteria could include academic discipline, home country,
experience with certain technologies, or other quantifiable
characteristics. Theentrofyalgorithm then yields the approximation of
pre-defined target proportions for each category by solving the
tie-breaking problem with provable performance guarantees. We show
howentrofyselects cohorts according to pre-determined characteristics in
simulated sets of applications and demonstrate its use in a case study
of Astro Hack Week. This two stage candidate and cohort selection
process allows human judgment and debate to guide the assessment of
candidates' merit in step 1. Then the human committee defines relevant
diversity criteria which will be used as computational parameters
inentrofy. Once the parameters are defined, the set of candidates who
meet the minimum threshold for merit are passed through theentrofycohort
selection procedure in step 2 which yields a cohort of a composition as
close as possible to the computational parameters defined by the
committee. This process has the benefit of separating the meritorious
assessment of candidates from certain elements of their diversity and
from some considerations around cohort composition. It also increases
the transparency and auditability of the process, which enables, but
does not guarantee, fairness. Splitting merit and diversity
considerations into their own assessment stages makes it easier to
explain why a given candidate was selected or rejected, though it does
not eliminate the possibility of objectionable bias.","Huppenkothen, Daniela and McFee, Brian and Noren, Laura",No data,10.1371/journal.pone.0231939,2020,No data

PREVENT A NEW OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The purpose of this study was to determine the possibility of practical
use of the Hackathon Platform for ecological protection of the
university biosystem to prevent a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affects companies and population's
behaviour. The most significant change occurred in the attitude of
companies to the environment from technical and technological points of
view. To increase their production sustainability, these companies are
looking at the possibilities of waste recovery through sustainable
recycling, or recovery of waste as a source of secondary raw material.
One of the simplest ways is to use agricultural waste for energy
purposes, bringing bioenergy to the forefront as a new area of Industry
4.0. The ALARA model was used to assess the quality of six biosystem
components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, the level of
land pollution with chemicals and littering by the unauthorized dumps;
sufficient volume of green planting on the territory). This allowed the
development of management decisions and environmental protection
measures based on the system of calculated indicators of potential
environmental damage for each of six biosystem components. The forecast
of plan implementation: the quality of four from among six biosystem
components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, sufficient
volume of green planting on the territory) will increase on average by
30-40\%. A minor improvement in the quality of the other biosystem
components (approx. by 10\%) raises concerns about the high probability

There is broad consensus amongst these scholars that stakeholders and
their values and concerns should be included in decision-making about
technological risks. It has also been argued that the emotional
responses of people can shed important light on the ethical aspects of
risk and uncertainty. However, people's emotions can be narrowly focused
and biased. This article therefore assesses the role that
technology-inspired artworks can play in overcoming such biases, by
challenging our imagination and providing us with different perspectives
on possible technological developments and their implications for
society. Philosophers have not yet studied such artworks, so this
constitutes an entirely new field of research for scholars of risk and
moral theory. In particular, we focus on the case of BNCI (Brain/Neural
Computer Interface) technologies and related artworks. These
technologies and artworks touch on questions of what it means to be
human, thereby raising profound ethical and philosophical challenges. We
discuss the experiences of artists, scientists, and engineers who are
directly involved with BNCI technologies, and who were interviewed
during a Hackathon at Amsterdam's Waag Society in June 2016. Their views
are analyzed in light of philosophical and aesthetic theories, which
allows us to consider relevant ethical and conceptual issues as well as
topics for further investigation.","Roeser, Sabine and Alfano, Veronica and Nevejan, Caroline","Risk; Controversial technologies; Art; Aesthetics; Emotions; Ethics;

article,"Perspectives on Great Lakes coastal management: A case study of the
Point Pelee foreland, Canada","Coastal systems on the Laurentian Great Lakes are highly affected by
meter scale variability in water levels that occur across a range of
temporal scales, from hourly wind set-up and seiches to inter-annual
highs and lows driven by longer-term patterns of precipitation and
evaporation. High lake level periods are often associated with increased
coastal erosion and flooding, stress on sensitive wetland ecosystems,
and damage to infrastructure. During the late 2010s, water levels on the
Great Lakes neared or exceeded record highs, initiating a renewed
interest in coastal management across the region. The objective of this
study was to inform and engage regional experts and local interest
groups and to examine their perspectives on the important processes,
coastal man-agement solutions, and applied research needed for the
conservation of the Point Pelee (PP) foreland in Lake Erie. A virtual
conference, the Point Pelee `Hackathon,' used a crowd-sourced approach
to problem solving where participants were presented `the sum of the
discourse,' or the current state of knowledge on coastal processes and
management affecting the region. The conference covered a range of
topics through invited speaker pre-sentations, followed by individual
surveys and moderated group discussions. Q-methodology surveys
incorpo-rated concepts informed by the sum of the discourse and
identified statistically significant sources of agreement and
disagreement on management challenges and solutions among `like-minded'
individuals. Common view-points identified harbours \& jetties and
sediment nourishment projects as an important cause of erosion and
mitigation strategy, whereas highly opposed viewpoints were held on the
importance of sediment supply and adopting a `do-nothing' approach for
coastal management. Emergent and more nuanced viewpoints were also found
within group discussions, highlighting important considerations that can
be used to advance the discourse on proposed management solutions. The
results of this study can be used to guide the development of a regional
coastal management strategy, and a similar methodology can be used to
inform and engage stakeholders and examine perspectives on a range of
issues affecting the world's marine and lacustrine coasts.","Smith, Alex and Houser, Chris","Coastal management; Great lakes; Geomorphology; Climate change;

article,Promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African context,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an intervention strategy
for promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African
context, followed by a reflection thereof based on qualitative data
collected from students. Career awareness during study has shown to be a
factor in the work-readiness of IT graduates.
Design/methodology/approach The paper suggests an intervention strategy
aimed at promoting IT students' career awareness. It provides context of
the exit-level higher education (HE) module used to implement the
intervention. Career awareness is achieved by industry talks, projects
and events. Interpretive data collection and content analysis are used
to understand the impact of the intervention from the students'
perspective. Findings Recommendations are made towards productive
interventions for raising career awareness among IT students using
industry participation in higher education. The proposed intervention
comprises of a combination of industry talks, capstone projects and
specific events. Students had largely positive reactions and made
suggestions for additional interventions they would find beneficial. A
hackathon attended proved the most influential where seven out of eight
involved students received job offers from one company. Other students
became aware of their own employability, limitations and preferred
career paths. Originality/value Findings provide confirmation on
existing feasible approaches and also introduces new interventions that
may be generalised to other fields of study. The paper not only provides
an instructional design for a module to raise career awareness but also
reflects on the feedback of the students. The reflection provided by
students acts as a point of reference to ensure that the process
followed for the intervention is practical within a South African
context. The paper highlights the perceived benefits of involving
industry in higher education to raise career awareness, factors that may
prevent career awareness among IT students and valuable suggestions made
by students to further enhance the intervention strategy. An implication
of the research is a set of guidelines identified towards bridging the
IT theory-practice gap. These guidelines can be used by many educators
in similar environments to justify their interventions.","van Rensburg, J. T. Janse and Goede, Roelien","Career awareness; Reflective practice; Industry involvement; Higher

article,"Developing reproducible bioinformatics analysis workflows for
heterogeneous computing environments to support African genomics","Background: The Pan-African bioinformatics network, H3ABioNet, comprises
27 research institutions in 17 African countries. H3ABioNet is part of
the Human Health and Heredity in Africa program (H3Africa), an
African-led research consortium funded by the US National Institutes of
Health and the UK Wellcome Trust, aimed at using genomics to study and
improve the health of Africans. A key role of H3ABioNet is to support
H3Africa projects by building bioinformatics infrastructure such as
portable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows for use on
heterogeneous African computing environments. Processing and analysis of
genomic data is an example of a big data application requiring complex
interdependent data analysis workflows. Such bioinformatics workflows
take the primary and secondary input data through several
computationally-intensive processing steps using different software
packages, where some of the outputs form inputs for other steps.
Implementing scalable, reproducible, portable and easy-to-use workflows
is particularly challenging.
Results: H3ABioNet has built four workflows to support (1) the calling
of variants from high-throughput sequencing data; (2) the analysis of
microbial populations from 16S rDNA sequence data; (3) genotyping and
genome-wide association studies; and (4) single nucleotide polymorphism
imputation. A week-long hackathon was organized in August 2016 with
participants from six African bioinformatics groups, and US and European
collaborators. Two of the workflows are built using the Common Workflow
Language framework (CWL) and two using Nextflow. All the workflows are
containerized for improved portability and reproducibility using Docker,
and are publicly available for use by members of the H3Africa consortium
and the international research community.
Conclusion: The H3ABioNet workflows have been implemented in view of
offering ease of use for the end user and high levels of reproducibility
and portability, all while following modern state of the art
bioinformatics data processing protocols. The H3ABioNet workflows will
service the H3Africa consortium projects and are currently in use. All
four workflows are also publicly available for research scientists
worldwide to use and adapt for their respective needs. The H3ABioNet
workflows will help develop bioinformatics capacity and assist genomics
research within Africa and serve to increase the scientific output of
H3Africa and its Pan-African Bioinformatics Network.","Baichoo, Shakuntala and Souilmi, Yassine and Panji, Sumir and Botha,

article,"A `Grantathon' model to mentor new investigators in mental health
research","Background: There is a critical gap between needs and available
resources for mental health treatment across the world, particularly in
low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). In countries committed to
increasing resources to address these needs it is important to conduct
research, not only to assess the depth of mental health needs and the
current provision of public and private mental health services, but also
to examine implementation methods and evaluate mental health approaches
to determine which methods are most effective in local contexts.
However, research resources in many LMICs are inadequate, largely
because conventional research training is time-consuming and expensive.
Adapting a hackathon model may be a feasible method of increasing
capacity for mental health services research in resource-poor countries.
Methods: To explore the feasibility of this approach, we developed a
`grantathon', i.e. a research training workshop, to build capacity among
new investigators on implementation research of Indian government-funded
mental health programmes, which was based on a need expressed by
government agencies. The workshop was conducted in Delhi, India, and
brought together junior faculty members working in mental health
services settings throughout the country, experienced international
behavioural health researchers and representatives of the Indian Council
for Medical Research (ICMR), the prime Indian medical research funding
agency. Pre- and post-assessments were used to capture changes in
participants' perceived abilities to develop proposals, design research
studies, evaluate outcomes and develop collaborations with ICMR and
other researchers. Process measures were used to track the number of
single-or multi-site proposals that were generated and funded.
Results: Participants (n = 24) generated 12 single-or multi-site
research grant applications that will be funded by ICMR.
Conclusion: The grantathon model described herein can be modified to
build mental health services research capacity in other contexts. Given
that this workshop not only was conceptualised and delivered but also
returned results in less than 1 year, this model has the potential to
quickly build research capacity and ultimately reduce the mental health
treatment gap in resource-limited settings.","Hawk, Mary and Nimgaonkar, Vishwajit and Bhatia, Triptish and Brar,

article,"Situational Awareness of Large Infrastructures Using Remote Sensing: The
Rome-Fiumicino Airport during the COVID-19 Lockdown","Situational awareness refers to the process of aggregating
spatio-temporal variables and measurements from different sources,
aiming to improve the semantic outcome. Remote Sensing satellites for
Earth Observation acquire key variables that, when properly aggregated,
can provide precious insights about the observed area. This article
introduces a novel automatic system to monitor the activity levels and
the operability of large infrastructures from satellite data. We
integrate multiple data sources acquired by different spaceborne
sensors, such as Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series,
Sentinel-2 multispectral data, and Pleiades Very-High-Resolution (VHR)
optical data. The proposed methodology exploits the synergy between
these sensors for extracting, at the same time, quantitative and
qualitative results. We focus on generating semantic results, providing
situational awareness, and decision-ready insights. We developed this
methodology for the COVID-19 Custom Script Contest, a remote hackathon
funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission
(EC), whose aim was to promote remote sensing techniques to monitor
environmental factors consecutive to the spread of the Coronavirus
disease. This work focuses on the Rome-Fiumicino International Airport
case study, an environment significantly affected by the COVID-19
crisis. The resulting product is a unique description of the airport's
area utilization before and after the air traffic restrictions imposed
between March and May 2020, during Italy's first lockdown. Experimental
results confirm that the proposed algorithm provides remarkable insights
for supporting an effective decision-making process. We provide results
about the airport's operability by retrieving temporal changes at high
spatial and temporal resolutions, together with the airplane count and
localization for the same period in 2019 and 2020. On the one hand, we
detected an evident change of the activity levels on those airport areas
typically designated for passenger transportation, e.g., the one close
to the gates. On the other hand, we observed an intensification of the
activity levels over areas usually assigned to landside operations,
e.g., the one close to the hangar. Analogously, the airplane count and
localization have shown a redistribution of the airplanes over the whole
airport. New parking slots have been identified as well as the areas
that have been dismissed. Eventually, by combining the results from
different sensors, we could affirm that different airport surface areas
have changed their functionality and give a non-expert interpretation
about areas' usage.","Pulella, Andrea and Sica, Francescopaolo","situational awareness; COVID-19; activity monitoring; Synthetic Aperture

article,"Public sector, open innovation, and collaborative governance in lockdown
times. A research of Spanish cases during the COVID-19 crisis","Purpose
This paper aims to study the results of open innovation initiatives in
Spain under the lockdown during the first stages of the COVID-19 crisis.
Based on the most recent literature on open innovation in the public
sector, this paper explores the following research questions, namely,
what are the key features of collaborative governance processes that
guided open innovation initiatives in the Spanish public sector during
the COVID-19 crises? How open public innovation cases generated public
value to the society during the COVID-19 crises in Spain?
Design/methodology/approach
The study is based on two in-depth case studies of open innovation in
the public sector: the collaborative platform Frena la Curva and the
hackathon Vence al Virus, both launched during the first moments of the
COVID-19 crisis. The methodology is based on 13 semi-structured
interviews, content observation and documentary analysis. The data were
interpreted according to the dimensions described in the analytical
framework: descriptive dimensions of both initiatives but also their
degree of elaboration, incentives and objectives, characteristics of
governance and collaboration between actors and challenges for the
accountability processes; and finally, their procedural legitimacy,
considering the COVID-19 crisis context.
Findings
The results of the study show that citizens have played a key role
during the hardest stage of the crisis, collaborating with governments
and advancing their innovative capabilities, mostly in the digital
sphere. The analysis also identified different outcomes, including the
improvement of citizen's involvement, deliberation practices or network
building. Besides, this paper has identified some limitations and
barriers to open innovation and collaborative governance processes in
terms of accountability and legitimacy of these initiatives. Here, their
contribution was constrained by the emerging stage of implementation and
by the unique circumstances of the lockdown under the COVID-19 crisis.
Research limitations/implications
Future advancements of open innovation initiatives to consolidate
collaborative governance processes will need further exploration.
Although this paper diversified the contacts and the data collection in
the fieldwork to avoid social biases, the results of the interviews
might reflect very positive outcomes. Despite the case studies that took
place during the COVID-19 crisis and their planned actions to maintain
their existence, the post-crisis analysis will be needed to assess the
impact of these open innovation cases in collaborative governance
structures.
Practical implications
Open innovation is an emerging narrative and practice in the public
sector requiring time and energy from public officials and managers. The
study also highlighted the problem of how to legitimate open innovation
cases in the public sector and the implications for their
institutionalization. Public managers involved in these types of
initiatives need to keep the momentum both inside and outside their
organizations. Regarding the utilization of information and
communications technologies (ICTs), open innovation processes do not
need technology to develop their full potential, whereas the COVID-19
crisis and the ongoing digitalization of work settings, accessibility,
etc., could transform ICTs into a critical tool for public managers
leading innovation initiatives within their organizations.
Social implications
The social implications of this paper are manifold. This study provides
evidence of one of the future avenues of public management: open
innovation.
New avenues for the involvement and collaboration of citizens with
public authorities are another social implication pinpointed by this
paper. Democratic legitimacy and procedural accountability are assessed
using the open innovation case studies during the COVID-19 crisis.
Finally, transforming governments using collaborative platforms deserves
social oversight understanding if they really contribute to build trust
in political institutions.
Originality/value
Despite their differences, both Frena la Curva and Vence al Virus
demonstrated the potential and limitations of public innovation and
collaborative governance to cope with an unprecedented crisis such as
the COVID-19. The special features of this emergency, including the long
period of confinement, posed challenges and also opportunities to
develop these initiatives: as several interviewees stated, these
projects helped to channel the civic energy to co-produce solutions in
collaboration with a wide range of actors. Data allow us to identify the
key features of collaborative governance that guided open innovation
initiatives in the Spanish public sector during the COVID-19 crisis.","Ignacio Criado, J. and Guevara-Gomez, Arian","Trust; Collaboration; Accountability; Open innovation; Public
