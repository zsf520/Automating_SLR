inproceedings,Hackathons as a Pedagogical Strategy to Engage Students to Learn and to Adopt Software Engineering Practices,"Teaching Software Engineering is not a trivial duty since several pedagogical strategies can be used and sometimes the impact of these on students is uncertain. Hackathons are similar to marathons, however used to produce solutions to solve a specific problem in a short period of time and based on intense collaboration. Educational hackathons aim to promote learning in such an environment. The Undergraduate computing programs of PUCRS decided to use a hackathon as a pedagogical strategy aiming to motivate the students to practice the adoption of software development practices and to work in groups as a means to practice the development of social skills. Therefore, we conducted a case study to investigate: 1) The motivations to students to attend or not attend an educational hackathon, 2) The students perceptions about this hackathon, 3) The Software Engineering practices adopted by students. In this study, we identified factors that may affect students motivation to participate (e.g., improve the teamwork skills), some students expectations about the hackathon (e.g., work in teams), and the practices adopted by the students (e.g., pair programming). Some of our findings include that students enjoy participating in an informal educational environment (e.g., hackathons) to improve their technical skills and to build network with some colleagues. This study can provide insights to teachers that wants to organize some activity than traditional teaching and the students perspective about this kind of strategy.","Steglich, Caio and Salerno, Larissa and Fernandes, Tha\'{\i}s and Marczak, Sabrina and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana Paula and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio","Student Motivation, Case Study, Software Engineering Education, Educational Hackathon",10.1145/3422392.3422479,2020,10
inproceedings,An Online Educational Hackathon to Foster Professional Skills and Intense Collaboration on Software Engineering Students,"The global pandemic of COVID19 demanded that professors rethink teaching strategies considering the use of online environments due to the social isolation stipulated to reduce the rate of contagion of the disease. A challenge for software engineering professors is to develop fundamental professional skills in students who are in the process of learning using these virtual environments. The purpose of this study is to identify how an online educational hackathon can support students of a Software Engineering program to develop professional skills. We also seek to understand how intense collaboration takes place between student teams, considering the digital context for the production of a technological solution. We conducted a Case Study on an educational hackathon that took place in the online context, collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, and observations. As some results, the skills that students most considered that this hackathon helped them to develop were communication, initiative, and creativity/innovation, among others. Also, the strategies of collaboration adopted by the students during this competition, considering the remote context. Therefore, the main contribution is the identification of how the realization of this event supported students to develop professional skills and to practice collaboration skills with each other.","Steglich, Caio and Marczak, Sabrina and Guerra, Luiz and Trindade, C\'{a}ssio and Dutra, Alessandra and Bacelo, Ana","Case Study, Educational Hackathon, Software Engineering Education, Intense Collaboration",10.1145/3474624.3476973,2021,10
inproceedings,Hackathon Approach: Its Contributions on Collaboration and Teamwork Skills: A Case Study in Maritime Sector,"The main objective of this study was to examine how the use of a hackathon approach impacts the collaboration and teamwork skills. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from an observation carried out during a hackathon conducted in France with 70 participants. A survey was also developed to analyse the participants’ perception of the different dimensions of the intra-team collaboration. In this study a positive impact of a hackathon was observed on the intra-team collaboration and on the development of hard and soft skills of the participants. The format of a hackathon could be used at the company scale to speed up employees’ learning process. Thus, team learning could be improved and accelerated by the hackathon approach, through the sharing of experience and knowledge of people with various backgrounds, the caring nature of the team, and their willingness to meet the challenge all together.","Lyonnet, Barbara","Information system management, Ccollaborative learning, Skills, Hackathon approach",10.1145/3510309.3510324,2022,8
inproceedings,Online Hackathons as an Engaging Tool to Promote Group Work in Emergency Remote Learning,"In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational activities had to be done remotely as a way to avoid the spread of the disease. Instead of shifting to an online learning model, it consisted of a transition to what was called Emergency Remote Teaching. This is a strategy to keep activities going on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of universities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and students. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles for students to continue engaged.Before the pandemic, hackathons -- short-lived events (1 to 3 days) of intensive collaboration to develop software prototypes -- were being explored as an alternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical skills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an online hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their semester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency remote teaching period. We describe the intervention and analyze the students' perspective of the approach. One of the findings was the importance of the Discord communication tool -- used by students for playing games -- which helped them socialize and be engaged in synchronous group work, ""virtually collocated"".","Gama, Kiev and Zimmerle, Carlos and Rossi, Pedro","hackathons, emergency remote teaching, online learning",10.1145/3430665.3456312,2021,7
inproceedings,Integrating Hackathons into an Online Cybersecurity Course,"Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.","Affia, Abasi-amefon Obot and Nolte, Alexander and Matulevi\v{c}ius, Raimundas","educational hackathon, online learning, cybersecurity education",10.1145/3510456.3514151,2022,12
inproceedings,Evaluating Effectiveness of Innovative Education Formats for 21st Century Skills: The Example of DaVinciLab YouthHackathon Workshops 2019/2020,"It has become increasingly important for youngsters to acquire digital competencies and 21st century skills. Schools across different countries have introduced in their curricula activities and topics on these efforts, however, to varying degrees and with varying effectiveness, depending on a number of reasons. In this paper we report on a study on the effectiveness of the DaVinciLab Youth Hackathon (YH) workshops as a form of intervention in the school system in order to increase digital competencies and 21st skills (4Cs - Communication, Collaboration, Critical Reflection and Creativity) among students and teachers as part of the implementation of basic digital education (Digitale Grundbildung) in Austrian schools. Our methodical research approach included participating observations of YH workshops in and outside the school setting, quantitative surveys and a literature review in the field of learning science. Our evaluation showed that the workshops can be an effective addition and support for schools to close current gaps in the curriculum for basic digital education and to implement parts of the curriculum through project and team-based teaching and learning methods. In order to integrate the format more strongly into the Austrian educational ecosystem, longer-term funding and better integration into training programs for teachers/in-service teachers would be needed. Finally, long-term support through research studies that are carried out in cooperation with different educational institutions could be helpful in future improvements.","Dorn, Amelie and Wandl-Vogt, Eveline and Romano, Anna and Jekel, Thomas and Gawin, Anna","Basic Digital Education, Innovative Education formats, Team-based learning, Hackathons, Scaffolding",10.1145/3434780.3436671,2021,7
inproceedings,Post-Hackathon Learning Circles: Supporting Lean Startup Development,"Hackathons provide rapid, hands-on opportunities to explore innovative solutions to problems, but provide little support to teams in moving those solutions into practice. We explore the use of post-hackathon Learning Circles to connect hackathon teams with key stakeholders, to reflect on prototypes and consider business models. We conducted a qualitative field study with 4 post-hackathon teams on the theme of technology, social isolation, and aging. Our results show that Learning Circles are an effective way to involve stakeholders early in the development process, and to develop a deeper understanding of users, markets, and technology.","Chan, Tina and McMurray, Josephine and Levy, AnneMarie and Sveistrup, Heidi and Wallace, James","hackathon, social isolation, aging, participatory design",10.1145/3334480.3375216,2020,8
inproceedings,Pros and Cons of Running Educational Hackathons in a Gender-Neutral Fashion,"Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This research provides practices to implement hackathon courses gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.","Kovaleva, Yekaterina and Happonen, Ari and Hasheela-Mufeti, Victoria","stereotype, code camp, project-based, education, time pressure, gender-neutral, female, intensive event, hackathon",10.1145/3524501.3527603,2022,8
inproceedings,VR Hackathon with Goethe Institute: Lessons Learned from Organizing a Transdisciplinary VR Hackathon,"In this article we report a case study of a Language Learning Bauhaus VR hackathon with Goethe Institute. It was organized as an educational and research project to tap into the dynamics of transdisciplinary teams challenged with a specific requirement. In our case, it was to build a Bauhaus-themed German Language Learning VR App. We constructed this experiment to simulate how representatives of different disciplines may work together towards a very specific purpose under time pressure. So, each participating team consisted of members of various expert-fields: software development (Unity or Unreal), design, psychology and linguistics. The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes. We also provide guidelines on how to prepare the participants to work in rapid prototyping VR environments and benefit from such experiences in the long term.","Kope\'{c}, Wies\l{}aw and Kalinowski, Krzysztof and Kornacka, Monika and Skorupska, Kinga H. and Paluch, Julia and Jaskulska, Anna and Pochwatko, Grzegorz and Mo\.{z}aryn, Jakub Filip and Kobyli\'{n}ski, Pawe\l{} and Gago, Piotr","participatory design, language learning, hackathon, VR, teamwork",10.1145/3411763.3443432,2021,7
inproceedings,On Hackathons: A Multidisciplinary Literature Review,"The number of hackathon events worldwide has nearly quadrupled in the last five years. Despite exponential growth across diverse industries and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas (purpose, format, processes, and outcomes). Research was first driven by a purpose (innovation, learning, and collaboration), followed by an examination of how formats adjust to purpose to influence what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical reviews of the hackathon phenomena. We contribute a unifying framework with these four core areas to inform future directions of hackathon research and practice, as well as a discussion of the need for longitudinal and multidisciplinary research of hackathons.","Chau, Connie W. and Gerber, Elizabeth M.","literature review, multidisciplinary, hackathons",10.1145/3544548.3581234,2023,21
article,How to Support Newcomers in Scientific Hackathons - An Action Research Study on Expert Mentoring,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.","Nolte, Alexander and Hayden, Linda Bailey and Herbsleb, James D.","learning, hackathon, mentoring, scientific communities",10.1145/3392830,2020,23

This novel ""touchless"" feedback can be used for various use cases but is not widely adopted nor incorporated in everyday products. The 2022 TOUCHLESS Hackathon aimed to enable novel practitioners to learn about touchless technology, generate new ideas, and implement prototypes. We invited participants to a 3-day hackathon in Copenhagen, Denmark, where we introduced touchless technology and provided novel touchless devices for prototyping use cases. Participants were joined by experts on ultrasound haptics, who helped them achieve their prototyping goals. Coming from various educational and national backgrounds, the participants approached the task in different ways and created four unique interactive prototypes.

article,Implementation and Evaluation of a Virtual Hackathon in an Urban HSI Community College during COVID-19,"This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.","Azhar, Mohammad Q. and Haynes, Ada and Day, Marisa and Wissinger, Elizabeth",No data,No data,2023,13
article,What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects? Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,"Time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.","Nolte, Alexander and Chounta, Irene-Angelica and Herbsleb, James D.","social computing, hackathon, project sustainability, project continuation",10.1145/3415216,2020,26
inproceedings,Engaging Women’s Participation in Hackathons: A Qualitative Study with Participants of a Female-Focused Hackathon,"Hackathons are a sort of application development marathon typically lasting between 24 and 48 hours. They are increasingly becoming an alternative and popular method for fast learning and networking, bringing people together in a short period to do creative projects. However, the number of women participating in such events is extremely low and worrying, and literature lacks empirical evidence about the reasons for that. This qualitative study gathers data and brings a discussion about this topic, as an attempt to understand better why women are not so interested in this type of event. We interviewed participants of a female-focused hackathon and tried to (1) understand reasons for women not participating in hackathons; (2) understand motivational aspects; and (3) understand the main problems concerning gender in hackathons.","Paganini, Lavinia and Gama, Kiev","hackathons, Time-bounded events, gender",10.1145/3409456.3409458,2020,8
inproceedings,"How Gender, Ethnicity, and Public Presentation Shape Coding Perseverance after Hackathons","Hackathon-style coding events are a popular and promising approach to broadening participation in computer science and engineering. We present a quantitative analysis of self-reported perseverance in coding after hackathon-style events for 4,703 hackathon participants run by the nonprofit organization CodeDay. Drawing from previous work on broadening participation in computing, we test hypotheses that seek to answer three questions about whether and how hackathon-style coding events support continued engagement in computing among young people: (1) Are participants from underrepresented groups as likely to continue to engage in coding after attending a hackathon-style event? (2) Are participants more likely to continue to code after hackathon-style events if they attend events with demographically similar peers? (3) Are participants more likely to continue to code after a hackathon-style event if they present their work? In line with many studies of broadening participation, we find that members of underrepresented groups are less likely to report continuing to engage in programming 10 weeks after hackathon-style events. However, we find that these participants are more likely to report continuing to code when a larger proportion of attendees at their event share their gender or ethnicity. We also find that membership in underrepresented groups is associated with a greater likelihood of continued engagement when participants present their work to others at the end of events. Our work contributes to the literature on both education and broadening participation in computing by outlining several conditions under which hackathon-style events may be effective in promoting continued engagement among underrepresented young people.","Gan, Emilia and Menezes, Tyler and Hill, Benjamin Mako","Inclusiveness, Gender and Diversity, Outreach, Coding Interest, Hackathons, Belonging",10.1145/3564721.3564727,2022,11
inproceedings,“Learning from Mistakes is the Best Thing”: Risk and Persistence at Hackathons,"Hackathons are time-bound collaborative computer science competitions increasingly popular at undergraduate institutions. It is often claimed that their failure-friendly environment helps students become better computer scientists. The same features which encourage risk-taking, however, may increase imposter syndrome and stereotype threat. Furthermore, if hackathons really do radically celebrate emergent projects, why do so many participants leave without showcasing their work? This work addresses two research questions: 1) Do students consider hackathons as a space which is safe for taking risks and learning through failure? And 2) How does participants’ perception of risk affect their decisions to persist or quit the main event competition? Extensive mixed methods data was collected from student attendees, professors, and industry sponsors of three undergraduate computer science hackathons. Constructionism was used to understand participant learning through making in a failure-friendly environment, and social cognitive career theory was used to determine how risk affects decisions on continued participation. Results showed participants largely felt that risk was good for learning, although they did worry about their classwork, health, meeting their own standards, and public embarrassment. They felt much more free to take risks than in their CS classes, and wanted 60% of the skills they used to be new. External conflicts or an unfinished project were the reasons that half of participants didn’t submit for judging. As almost 80% of hackathon attendees have CS related majors, these findings have implications for how risks can be productively used for learning both at hackathons and CS classes.","Hardin, Caroline D","Failure, Risk-Taking, Hackathon, Constructionism",10.1145/3488042.3490175,2021,10
article,Socio-Technical Constraints and Affordances of Virtual Collaboration - A Study of Four Online Hackathons,"Hackathons and similar time-bounded events have become a popular form of collaboration in various domains. They are commonly organized as in-person events during which teams engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. Most research to date has thus consequently focused on studying how teams collaborate in a co-located setting, pointing towards the advantages of radical co-location. The global pandemic of 2020, however, has led to many hackathons moving online, which challenges our current understanding of how they function. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting findings from a multiple-case study of 10 hackathon teams that participated in 4 hackathon events across two continents. By analyzing the collected data, we found that teams merged synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to maintain a common understanding of work progress as well as to maintain awareness of each other's tasks. Task division was self-assigned based on individual skills or interests, while leaders emerged from different strategies (e.g., participant experience, the responsibility of registering the team in an event). Some of the affordances of in-person hackathons, such as the radical co-location of team members, could be partially reproduced in teams that kept open synchronous communication channels while working (i.e., shared audio territories), in a sort of ""radical virtual co-location"". However, others, such as interactions with other teams, easy access to mentors, and networking with other participants, decreased. In addition, the technical constraints of the different communication tools and platforms brought technical problems and were overwhelming to participants. Our work contributes to understanding the virtual collaboration of small teams in the context of online hackathons and how technologies and event structures proposed by organizers imply this collaboration.","Mendes, Wendy and Richard, Albert and Tillo, T\""{a}he-Kai and Pinto, Gustavo and Gama, Kiev and Nolte, Alexander","online hackathons, time-bounded collaborative events",10.1145/3555221,2022,32

We present an overview of the program goals and implementation and share our reflections on the strengths and challenges surrounding the event as organizers, participants, and co-designers. Our reflections include that open communication between co-designers and participants is crucial, and that working on well-scoped, feasible projects is motivating for participants. From a survey (n=48) of ATHack participants from 2014-2019, 89% of respondents would recommend the event and 75% reported that they learned about disability and user-centered design. Our reflections suggest that the collaborative hackathon model can engage students spark innovations in accessible interfaces.

inproceedings,Do Hackathon Projects Change the World? An Empirical Analysis of GitHub Repositories,"Hackathons, the increasingly popular collaborative technology challenge events, are praised for producing modern solutions to real world problems. They have, however, recently been criticized for positing that serious real world problems can be solved in 24-48 hours of undergraduate coding. Projects created at hackathons are typically demos or proof-of-concepts, and little is known about the fate of them after the hackathon ends. Do they receive continued development in preparation for real world use and maintenance as part of actually being used, or are they abandoned? Since participants often use GitHub (Microsoft's popular version control system), it is possible to check. This quantitative, empirical study uses a series of Python scripts to complete a robust analysis of development patterns for all 11,889 of the U.S. based 2018-2019 Major League Hacking (MLH) affiliated hackathon projects which had GitHub repositories. Of these projects, approximately 85% of commits were made within the first month, and approximately 77% of the total commits occurred within the first week. Only 7% of projects had any activity 6 months after the event ended. Evaluated projects had an average of only 3.097 distinct commit dates, and the average of commits divided by the length of the development period was only 0.1. This indicates that few projects receive the post-event attention expected of an actively developed project. Finally, this study offers a dialogue of possible ways to reformat hackathons to help increase the average longevity of the development period for projects.","McIntosh, Lukas and Hardin, Caroline D.","informal education, github, computer science education, hackathons",10.1145/3408877.3432435,2021,7
inproceedings,What Do Hackathons Do? Understanding Participation in Hackathons Through Program Theory Analysis,"Hackathons are increasingly embraced across diverse sectors as a way of democratizing the design of technology. Several attempts have been made to redefine the format and desired end goal of hackathons in recent years thereby warranting closer methodological scrutiny. In this paper, we apply program theory to analyze the processes and effects of 16 hackathon case studies through published research literature. Building upon existing research on hackathons, our work offers a critical perspective examining the methodological validity of hackathons and exemplifies how specific processes for organizing hackathons are modified for different purposes. Our main contribution is a program theory analysis of hackathon formats that provides an exploration and juxtaposition of 16 case studies in terms of causal relations between the input, process and the effects of hackathons. Our cataloguing of examples can serve as an inspirational planning resource for future organizers of hackathons.","Falk, Jeanette and Kannabiran, Gopinaath and Hansen, Nicolai Brodersen","participatory design, research methods, hackathons, program theory",10.1145/3411764.3445198,2021,16
article,"""The Personal is Political"": Hackathons as Feminist Consciousness Raising","Initially conceived as problem-focused programming events, hackathons have expanded to encompass a range of issue areas, stakeholders and activities. There have been important critiques of hackathons in relation to their format and structure, their epistemological assumptions, and their outputs and impacts. Scholars working in Feminist HCI have proposed design considerations for more inclusive hackathons that focus on social justice outcomes for marginalized groups. Evaluative work on hackathons has assessed entrepreneurial contributions, skill development, and affective impacts, but largely absent from the analysis is a view of long-term personal impacts on participants. What kinds of lasting impacts (if any) do issue-focused hackathons have on participants themselves? In this paper, we describe a post-hoc qualitative study with participants and organizers of a postpartum health hackathon in the U.S., one year after the event took place. Our goals were to understand people's motivations for participating, what impact (if any) their participation had on their lives, and how (if at all) their participation shaped how they now understand postpartum health. Our findings indicate that the hackathon functioned as a space of ""feminist consciousness raising"" in that it provided space for navigating and sharing personal experiences, contextualizing and connecting those experiences to structural oppression, and developing participants' self- and collective-efficacy to create design interventions and enact social change. Feminist consciousness raising is not just ""awareness-raising"", but rather a specific historic and contemporary practice which we describe and situate in relation to personal experiences of oppression around stigmatized topics. With these findings, we situate feminist consciousness raising in relation to the literature on hackathons and feminist HCI, speculate which aspects of the design of the event led to it fostering feminist consciousness raising, and generate recommendations for how to intentionally bring feminist consciousness raising to the design of hackathons and innovation events.","D'Ignazio, Catherine and Michelson, Rebecca and Hope, Alexis and Hoy, Josephine and Roberts, Jennifer and Krontiris, Kate","hackathons, race, feminism, gender, health, feminist hci",10.1145/3415221,2020,23

The study is based on the thematic analysis of ten in-depth interviews with the hackathon organisers. The findings report how trust among the organisers was encapsulated in 1) the shared big goal, 2) the significance of real-life networks, 3) a strong lead organiser on the collaboration forming on the fly, and 4) the lack of face-to-face contact in relation to becoming familiar or staying unknown. Technology related findings showed that the collaboration platforms were selected based on familiarity and ease of use. The chosen communication channels created a split between age groups, and transparency of the communication suffered somewhat from one-to-one communications in the background and divided application use. However, trust between the organisers helped them to overcame the transparency challenges. The findings are applicable to societal crisis situations in which technologies are used to build collaboration in aim to address shared challenges.","Karhu, Mari and Karampela, Maria and H\""{a}kkil\""{a}, Jonna","trust, hackathon, COVID-19, crisis, pandemic, online collaboration, collaborative technologies",10.1145/3543758.3547538,2022,5
inproceedings,The Comfort of Distance: Student Choices and Soft Skill Development during a Hybrid Hackathon in Post-Pandemic Learning,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted traditional educational methods, forcing a quick transition to emergency remote learning. With the subsequent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, universities and society as a whole gradually resumed in-person activities. Students and university staff had to readjust to on-site learning and its associated challenges. This experience report specifically focuses on a course at University [omitted] dedicated to the design and development of Distributed Applications. Students engaged in a hybrid hackathon – an activity blending in-person and remote work – as part of the course. Despite their preferences for in-person collaboration, the majority of the students opted for remote participation. The goal of this report is to understand the students’ choices and adaptations to this new post-pandemic educational setting. We collected data through an anonymous survey and group interviews, revealing that the preference for remote work stemmed from convenience. Despite this, the distant collaboration allowed students to develop various soft skills. This exploration can shed light on future educational approaches in a world where online and in-person interactions can coexist.","Gama, Kiev and Zimmerle, Carlos and Paganini, Lavinia","soft skills, hackathons, hybrid learning, distant collaboration, collaborative learning",10.1145/3613372.3614201,2023,10
inproceedings,10 Years of Research With and On Hackathons,"Hackathon formats have been praised for their potential for promoting innovative thinking and making in a short time-frame. For this reason, hackathons have also been embraced by many researchers who use hackathons as part of their research in various ways. Through an extensive review of 381 publications published during a 10 year time span, we document the multiple ways in which hackathons are embraced and used by researchers The paper contributes to a better understanding of hackathons as part of research by providing a broad overview as a resource for researchers. We identify three main motivations for using hackathons as part of research: 1) Structuring learning, 2) structuring processes, and 3) enabling participation. For each of the motivations, we identify research with hackathons, and research on hackathons as two main categories. Drawing on several examples from the review we discuss benefits and challenges of using hackathons as part of research.","Falk Olesen, Jeanette and Halskov, Kim","hackathons, literature review, research method",10.1145/3357236.3395543,2020,16
inproceedings,Interactive Machine Learning for Embodied Interaction Design: A Tool and Methodology,"As immersive technologies are increasingly being adopted by artists, dancers and developers in their creative work, there is a demand for tools and methods to design compelling ways of embodied interaction within virtual environments. Interactive Machine Learning allows creators to quickly and easily implement movement interaction in their applications by performing examples of movement to train a machine learning model. A key aspect of this training is providing appropriate movement data features for a machine learning model to accurately characterise the movement then recognise it from incoming data. We explore methodologies that aim to support creators’ understanding of movement feature data in relation to machine learning models and ask how these models hold the potential to inform creators’ understanding of their own movement. We propose a 5-day hackathon, bringing together artists, dancers and designers, to explore designing movement interaction and create prototypes using new interactive machine learning tool InteractML.","Plant, Nicola and Hilton, Clarice and Gillies, Marco and Fiebrink, Rebecca and Perry, Phoenix and Gonz\'{a}lez D\'{\i}az, Carlos and Gibson, Ruth and Martelli, Bruno and Zbyszynski, Michael","performance, interactive machine learning, movement interaction, immersive media",10.1145/3430524.3442703,2021,5
article,Skill Development and Self-Efficacy for High School Girls via Virtual Hackathons,"This paper presents a virtual hackathon model for high school girls that was designed to mitigate the barriers to the gender gap in computer science. Through building Apps that solve real-world problems relevant to their communities, participants worked collaboratively to build competency, self-efficacy, and identity with computing. Six virtual hackathons were offered since summer 2020, successfully supporting 167 students, among them, 33% Latinas and 7.2% African Americans. Analyses of post-event survey responses, the Apps submitted by project teams, and judging scores and feedback pointed to students' growth in technical and professional skills, computing identity, and self-efficacy. Participants with little to no prior computing experience successfully demonstrated improved coding skills such as using variables, conditional and iterative statements, functions, and data tables. They also developed software engineering skills in teamwork, project management, and effective communication.","Gutta, Sreedevi and Ouyang, Youwen and Ochanji, Moses K.",No data,No data,2023,8
inproceedings,Performing Virtual Events During COVID-19 Pandemics: The Case of the Startups Fair and Hackathon for New Educational Technologies in the Campo Das Vertentes Region in Brazil,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought harsh social restrictions as part of the strategy to deal with the situation, which also required innovation to quickly adapt and keep providing substitutes through digital solutions. In response to this emergency, the local entrepreneurship ecosystem of S\~{a}o Jo\~{a}o del-Rei, Brazil, spent a great effort to tackle this new reality. This article presents the experience of performing virtual events to foster innovation and raise awareness of the local entrepreneurship culture. The first event was developed under the hackathon format, aiming to encourage the local community to propose technological innovation by developing solutions to assist distance learning in universities and high schools. The other event was a virtual fair presenting local startups to the audience, besides providing online courses related to entrepreneurship and new digital technologies. It is worth noting that those events were organized by a strategic coalition following the triple helix model of innovation, gathering universities, industry, and government. The results achieved through those events reinforce the importance of having an organized local strategic coalition to provide a fast response to social emergencies and provide better adaptation capability to society by creating innovations based on digital entrepreneurship.","B.

inproceedings,An Image Segment-Based Classification for Chest X-Ray Image,"In late 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has been rapidly growing since then. Molecular and antigen testing methods are very accurate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, with sudden increases of infected cases, laboratory-based molecular test and COVID-19 test kits are in short supply. Because the virus affects an infected patient’s lung, interpreting images obtained from Computed Tomography Scanners and Chest X-ray Radiography (CXR) machines can be an alternative for diagnosis. However CXR interpretation requires experts and the number of experts is limited. Therefore, automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images is required. We describe a system for automatic detection of COVID-19 from CXR images. It first segmented images to select only the lung. The segmented part was then fed into a multiclass classification module, which worked well with samples obtained from various sources, which had different aspect ratios, contrast and viewpoints. The system also handled the unbalanced dataset—only a small fraction of images showed COVID-19. Our system achieved 92% of F1-score and 88.1% Marco F1-score on the 3rd Deep Learning and AI Summer/Winter School Hackathon Phase 3—Multi-class COVID-19 Chest X-ray challenge public leaderboard.","Kittiworapanya, Phongsathorn and Pasupa, Kitsuchart","COVID-19, Imbalanced Data, Neural Networks, Coronavirus, Computer Vision",10.1145/3429210.3429227,2020,7
article,Exploring Participants’ Representations and Shifting Sensitivities in a Hackathon for Dementia,"Recent HCI research has addressed emerging approaches for public engagement. One such public-facing method which has gained popularity over the previous decade has been open design events, or hackathons. In this article, we report on DemVR, a hackathon event that invited designers, technologists, and students of these disciplines to design Virtual Reality (VR) environments for people with dementia and their care partners. While our event gained reasonable attraction from designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in representing and involving people with dementia in these events, which had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis presents insights into participants’ motivations, challenges participants faced when constructing their “absent user”, and the design features teams developed to address the social context of the user. We conclude the article by proposing a set of commitments for collaborative design events, community building through design, and reification in design.","Hodge, James and Foley, Sarah and Lambton-Howard, Dan and Booi, Laura and Montague, Kyle and Coulter, Sandra and Kirk, David and Morrissey, Kellie","hackathon, virtual reality, Dementia, social, care, community",10.1145/3571814,2023,35
inproceedings,Enabling Peer-Led Coding Camps by Creating a Seed Effect in Young Students,"During peer-led intensive events (such as hackathons and coding camps), students actively assist others to learn and, in turn, benefit from an effective learning environment. In this paper, we present the results of an observational study, having as a working setting a coding camp based on Computational Thinking (CT), to explore how peer-led coding camps can create a seed effect in young students. In particular, we analyze how a practical approach to convey CT skills motivates and effectively prepares student tutors. Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.","Fronza, Ilenia and Corral, Luis and Iaccarino, Gennaro and Pahl, Claus","coding camp, peer-assisted learning, computational thinking",10.1145/3450329.3476860,2021,6
inproceedings,An Empirical Study of the Characteristics of Popular Game Jams and Their High-Ranking Submissions on Itch.Io,"Game jams are hackathon-like events that allow participants to develop a playable game prototype within a time limit. They foster creativity and the exchange of ideas by letting developers with different skill sets collaborate. Having a high-ranking game is a great bonus to a beginning game developer’s r\'{e}sum\'{e} and their pursuit of a career in the game industry. However, participants often face time constraints set by jam hosts while balancing what aspects of their games should be emphasized to have the highest chance of winning. Similarly, hosts need to understand what to emphasize when organizing online jams so that their jams are more popular, in terms of submission rate. In this paper, we study 1,290 past game jams and their 3,752 submissions on itch.io to understand better what makes popular jams and high-ranking games perceived well by the audience. We find that a quality description has a positive contribution to both a jam’s popularity and a game’s ranking. Additionally, more manpower organizing a jam or developing a game increases a jam’s popularity and a game’s high-ranking likelihood. High-ranking games tend to support Windows or macOS, and belong to the “Puzzle”, “Platformer”, “Interactive Fiction”, or “Action” genres. Also, shorter competitive jams tend to be more popular. Based on our findings, we suggest jam hosts and participants improve the description of their products and consider co-organizing or co-participating in a jam. Furthermore, jam participants should develop multi-platform multi-genre games. Finally, jam hosts should introduce a tighter time limit to increase their jam’s popularity.","Vu, Quang N. and Bezemer, Cor-Paul","game jams, empirical software engineering, itch.io, game development, mining software repositories",10.1145/3402942.3402981,2020,11
inproceedings,Enhancing Data Education with Datathons: An Experience with Open Data on Renewable Energy Systems,"Data literacy and the fundamentals of big data management are becoming interdisciplinary in Higher Education curricula, also due to the widespread need of data science skills. This casts the need for presenting novel (and more engaging) learning activities to students. Data hackathons (also known as datathons) represent a viable option to allow students practicing with real use cases and datasets, as well as addressing their learning experiences collaboratively. Moreover, datathons promise to improve soft skills and offer hands-on learning opportunities. Therefore, we present in this paper a datathon on a publicly available dataset about renewable energy systems. The datathon involved students from three data-focused courses of three different M.S. degrees at the University of Salento (Italy). A detailed analysis of the design, implementation and evaluation choices is proposed, along with a series of gathered insights and lessons learned that might help systematizing the introduction and use of datathons in data education.","Longo, Antonella and Zappatore, Marco and Martella, Angelo and Rucco, Chiara","open data, datathon, renewable energy systems, data education curricula",10.1145/3531072.3535322,2022,6

In this paper, we will present the result of a study to assess the impact of integrating co-curricular activities and practical skills into the undergraduate CS curriculum. More than 500 senior CS students were surveyed over a span of four semesters about their comfort level, use of practical skills, and their experience in a sophomore-level required course which was redesigned a few years ago. The new course introduced practical skills such as version control, SQL, command line tools, and web development as a way to better engage the students and prepare them for co-curricular computing experiences. Our data analysis provides insight about when and where students use practical skills, how students feel about co-curricular activities, and the positive impact of the course redesign on the overall student experience.","Hooshangi, Sara and Buxton, Ryan and Ellis, Margaret","problem-solving skills, co-curricular activities, comfort level",10.1145/3502718.3524802,2022,7

The idea behind the patterns is to encourage discussion among students on-site and reach out to experts that would not be available otherwise. Inverted conferences are conference like settings on campus but the actual speakers are streamed from somewhere else. TED evenings or TED sessions are educational setups where docents are integrating TED talks into the course.

article,Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease Outbreaks Through Hackathons,"Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate engineering students about public health without interfering with required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons, short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre- and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an increased understanding of public health professions and how they can contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore, hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering students about topics outside of their discipline.","Pakpour, Nazzy and Nouredini, Sahar and Tandon, James",,10.1109/TE.2022.3159150,2022,9
inproceedings,Effectiveness of Hackathons in Software Engineering Education,"This Research Full Paper presents quantitative and qualitative data on the effectiveness of hackathons in Software Engineering Education. Hackathons have become a growing part of Software Engineering (SE) education in the past decade. Although the academic environment develops technical foundations, a hackathon can develop key competencies to hone lifelong learning. Improving interpersonal, entrepreneurial, and technical skills better prepare SE students for a career after graduation and reinforces engineering-relevant skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and management. This study examines students’ abilities to transfer relevant course skills into the hackathon environment, specifically those related to SE best practices such as software design, SOLID principles (Single-responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion Principle), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Furthermore, through faculty-led hackathon prep sessions and workshops, students are trained to follow an adapted design-thinking process known as the Hackathon Design Thinking Process (HDTP). This study directly addresses the following sub-questions: to what extent do participants feel that hackathons have a positive impact on their SE education, what are the participants’ perceptions of SOLID principles and OOP skill development during the hackathon, and how effectively are participants able to apple SOLID principles and OOP practices during the hackathon? The data is aggregated from a second-year SE undergraduate and a first-year SE masters cohort from participant perception surveys, judges, and project submissions from two hackathons. We utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Google’s Sentiment Analysis, conduct Kendall’s Tau-b Test using IBM’s SPSS Statistics Tool, and compare Class Diagrams with student-submitted code. Results confirm that participants believe hackathons positively impact their education and tend to sacrifice planning time to implement solutions, often disobeying SE design principles and best practices due to the fast-paced nature of hackathons.","Haque, Risat and Salmani, Ali and Raessinejad, Niyousha and Moshirpour, Mohammad",,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962527,2022,8
inproceedings,The Secret Life of Hackathon Code Where does it come from and where does it go?,"Background: Hackathons have become popular events for teams to collaborate on projects and develop software prototypes. Most existing research focuses on activities during an event with limited attention to the evolution of the code brought to or created during a hackathon. Aim: We aim to understand the evolution of hackathon-related code, specifically, how much hackathon teams rely on pre-existing code or how much new code they develop during a hackathon. Moreover, we aim to understand if and where that code gets reused, and what factors affect reuse. Method: We collected information about 22,183 hackathon projects from Devpost- a hackathon database - and obtained related code (blobs), authors, and project characteristics from the World of Code. We investigated if code blobs in hackathon projects were created before, during, or after an event by identifying the original blob creation date and author, and also checked if the original author was a hackathon project member. We tracked code reuse by first identifying all commits containing blobs created during an event before determining all projects that contain those commits. Result: While only approximately 9.14% of the code blobs are created during hackathons, this amount is still significant considering time and member constraints of such events. Approximately a third of these code blobs get reused in other projects. The number of associated technologies and the number of participants in a project increase reuse probability. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates to what extent pre-existing code is used and new code is created during a hackathon and how much of it is reused elsewhere afterwards. Our findings help to better understand code reuse as a phenomenon and the role of hackathons in this context and can serve as a starting point for further studies in this area.","Imam, Ahmed and Dey, Tapajit and Nolte, Alexander and Mockus, Audris and Herbsleb, James D.",,10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00020,2021,12
inproceedings,Integrating Hackathons into an Online Cybersecurity Course,"Cybersecurity educators have widely introduced hackathons to facilitate practical knowledge gaining in cybersecurity education. Introducing such events into cybersecurity courses can provide valuable learning experiences for students. The nature of the hackathon format encourages a learning-by-doing approach, and the hackathon outcomes can serve as evidence for students knowledge, capability and learning gains. Prior work on hackathons in education mainly focused on collocated hackathon events in the traditional classroom setting. These hackathon events often took place as a one-off event at the end of the course. However, one-off hackathon events at the end of a course might not be sufficient to improve learning. Instead, we focus on analyzing the integration of a series of online hackathon events into an online cybersecurity course and explore how this integration can address online education issues by encouraging collaboration and developing a practical understanding of the delivered course by solving real-world challenges. We evaluate interventions to foster learning and analyze its effect on collaboration and learning gains for students in the course. Our findings indicate that students attribute learning benefits to the introduced interventions that supported teamwork and collaboration, maintained student participation and interest in the course, and encouraged learning-by-doing.","Affia, Abasi-Amefon Obot and Nolte, Alexander and Matulevičius, Raimundas",,,2022,12
inproceedings,Promoting Game Jams and Hackathons as more Women-Inclusive Environments for Informal Learning,"Hackathons and game jams are informal venues to engage STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students in practical learning and nurturing interdisciplinary competencies (e.g., programming, design, communication). They also offer rich opportunities for networking and boosting the employability of participants. However, due to the not very inclusive culture created around them, these events may become hostile places for women. The low participation of women in hackathons and game jams may result in a loss of opportunity for them to improve their skills or to find jobs. Little is known about the motivations and perceptions of women participating in hackathons and game jams. We aimed at understanding (1) what are the typical gender-related problems women face in hackathons and game jams and how the perspective of men differ in regards to that problem; (2) how women perceive their motivations and their experience when participating in such events; and (3) what deters some women from participating. In this paper, we surveyed 211 participants of 8 events of this nature targeting higher education students with multidisciplinary backgrounds: 2 game jams (one of them women-focused) and 6 hackathons (one of them women-focused). Additionally, we applied a survey to hear the voice of 47 women who never attended these events to understand their lack of motivation. Through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, we compared the perspectives of men and women who participated in the studied hackathons and game jams. The qualitative data allowed us to investigate different experiences of women who reported discomfort in these events. As contributions of this paper, based on the collected data, we report different perspectives that men and women have about gender issues in these events and highlight the typical sexist behavior (bropriating, mansplaining, etc) of men participating in hackathons and game jams. Results showed that learning is the main motivation for both men and women to join these events. We also map the common reasons for women not being motivated to participate in these types of gatherings. Finally, we propose recommendations so that hackathons and game jams can increase gender equality. Our experience suggests these events, if well planned and executed, may become drivers to change attitudes and stereotypes regarding women in computing. By lowering those barriers, women can be more engaged and stimulated so they can also take advantage of more opportunities for STEAM learning in such informal settings.","Paganini, Lavínia and Ferraz, Cláudia and Gama, Kiev and Alves, Carina",,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637301,2021,9
inproceedings,Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies for Intellectual Capital (re)generation: An emerging framework,"Hackathons are events that bring together people with diverse backgrounds and expertise in a single location over a limited time to develop disruptive ideas and artifacts. The skyrocketing success of Hackathons across various domains and sectors is due to the opportunities they offer to leverage the creative and Intellectual capacity of the crowd, and to develop new relationships, skills, knowledge, solutions, and processes. However, Hackathons' potential in relation to Intellectual Capital (IC) has been overlooked by the literature so far, and few studies focus on their outcomes and evaluation. This study addresses this issue by conceptualizing Hackathons as ephemeral adhocracies whose value proposition includes the (re)generation of IC at the system level. Based on this conceptualization, we leverage the authors' participant observation through active involvement in 57 Hackathons globally with various roles (i.e., participant, mentor, facilitator, jury, and organizer) between 2014-2020. Through iterative qualitative analysis carried out on the literature and empirical material, we identify 32 distinctive critical attributes through which Hackathons may differ from one another. We leverage the literature and the empirical material to highlight how each of these 32 attributes may influence the three key dimensions of IC (i.e., Human, Relational, and Structural). Our analysis offers a framework that can be useful for practitioners when approaching Hackathons and serve as a foundation for design and evaluation instruments, while opening the way for future research on Hackathons as emerging organizational forms specifically devoted to IC (re)generation.","Grande, Simona and Franco, Mattia and De Bernardi, Paola and Ricciardi, Francesca",,10.1109/ICTMOD49425.2020.9380595,2020,5
article,Curricular Hackathons for Engineering Design Learning: The Case of Engineering Design Days,"Contribution: This article defines “curricular hackathons” and describes the features, challenges, and opportunities of adopting the hackathon format into engineering curricula. It is based on experience implementing a series of curricular hackathons which provide students with formative design experiences as they address ill-structured and integrative design problems. Background: Design is an essential part of engineering practice. However, undergraduate engineering students are provided few opportunities to develop the skills necessary for solving ill-structured and complex design problems prior to their final year capstone projects. Cornerstone projects and other summative activities are common attempts to introduce students to design, but often carry significant academic weight in the host course. Adapting the hackathon format into curricular elements could provide a useful pedagogy for formative design practice. Research Question: How can the hackathon format be effectively adapted into curricular activities? Methodology: The study uses a multiple case study research design to extract insight from 12 implementations of curricular hackathons in engineering at the University of Waterloo. The twelve cases were analyzed through two methods: 1) a synthesis of eight previous publications and 2) an interview study of 12 instructors involved in their design and implementation. Findings: Adapting the popular hackathon format to a curricular setting requires several adaptations to maximize the impact on students. Curricular hackathons: are a short, high intensity social experience; that guide students through the design-build-test cycle of a design problem, include opportunities for reflection; and achieve some level of integration and/or embedding in a program’s curriculum.","Rennick, Christopher and Litster, Greg and Hulls, C.

inproceedings,Designing an Effective Hackathon via University-Industry Collaboration for Data Science Education,"Hackathons have been used not only by enterprises for technological innovation and digital transformation, but also in academia for education innovation and programme promotion. This paper presents a hybrid approach for transforming an enterprise's workplace problem into a technology vendor-sponsored hackathon education. A real-life case study of a hackathon for college participants who are prospective students of a university data science programme is demonstrated. The university-industry collaborative approach of the hackathon provides several benefits for its stakeholders, namely promoting the reputation and recognition of the university's data science programme; offering creative and innovative solutions to the enterprise's workplace problems; encouraging the adoption of the technology vendor's platform, and finally, enhancing the teaching and learning experience for the college students and lecturers. This paper provides a structured framework and recommends practical principles and guidelines for designing effective hackathons that can bring about mind-set change and real-world business transformation.","Yuen, Kevin Kam Fung and Wong, Amy Ooi Mei",,10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678826,2021,6
inproceedings,A systematic review for organizing hackathons and code camps in Covid-19 like times: Literature in demand to understand online hackathons and event result continuation,"The hackathons related systematic literature review findings, from the past 15 years, show that academics mostly focus on giving overview, describing and explaining the events. It also seems to be quite popular to present an overview of event arrangements. The research, which appears to be missing, is the new style of hackathons, which were a requirement for online hackathons and remote events because of the social distancing, e.g., what covid-19 did demand from global society. By core design, hackathons have always been social gatherings and innovation events. Especially in these exceptional times with social distancing requirements, hackathon organizers turned towards online models. As this is not the original way these events have been organized, it was hard to get the best practices to how to proceed as there are few to none general guidelines and models for online/remote hackathons. By studying the current academic literature, our systematic literature review concludes that contemporary academic literature does not give too much guidance either. This review concludes that more practical, on-site, and educational problem-based development research studies about online and remote hackathon events are needed. Especially research on means and tools to utilize to organize them and handle exceptions and be successful in new normal.","Happonen, Ari and Tikka, Matvei and Usmani, Usman Ahmad",,10.1109/ICoDSE53690.2021.9648459,2021,6
inproceedings,Community-based Hackathon as a Problem Identification Tool for Capstone Projects,"Hackathons can be defined as platforms for fostering the innovation of small, focused teams who come together to collaborate in solving a particular problem built through a new or existing technology. A community-based hackathon for problem identification was explored in a bid to advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) on ending poverty, attaining equitable quality education and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth as articulated in, “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” by the United Nations continue to be inspire impactful research on how to attain these by the target year 2030. The aim of the study was to identify the problems faced by local communities; craft proposed solutions to create a knowledge base which could be used as input for the capstone projects in the year 2023 at university X. This study used focus groups within the hackathons to gather data from three communities in the KZN, GP and WC provinces of South Africa as part of its effort to understand the application domain and associated requirements. In the paper we present the results of the hackathons. The study found that the attaining of sustainability in communities through poverty eradication and the promotion of sustained inclusive and sustainable growth can only be achieved if communities sit at the centre of initiatives that seek to improve the lives of ordinary community members. Secondly the study showed the important role communities can play in their development and the power of collaboration between the local community and the universities in solving societal problems. The study also displayed the clear benefits of communities of practice and presents a foundation to sustainable development projects in the community. The study also found that communities are not short of brilliance and with some assistance they can identify and classify their problems as well as develop paper prototypes in a bid to solve the identified problems. The researchers conclude that future collaboration between the local communities and universities could be a game changer for the inclusion of real-life challenges for an authentic student learning experience.","Risinamhodzi, David T. and Heymann, Reolyn",,10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125204,2023,8
inproceedings,Utilizing Hackathons to Foster Sustainable Product Innovation - The Case of a Corporate Hackathon Series,"In order to remain competitive, software companies need to continuously develop new or advance existing products. In recent years, they have increasingly turned towards organizing hackathons for this purpose. During such events, teams of employees engage in intense collaboration over a short period of time to complete a project that is of interest to them. While research on hackathons has been growing steadily in recent years, there is a lack of studies focusing on the continuation of hackathon projects after an event has ended in particular in a corporate context. Our study aims to contribute to existing work in this area by focusing on a corporate hackathon series that was organized by a medium-sized Eastern European software company. Our findings support and extend prior research by indicating that teams consisting of members who aim to improve their skills, that engage in project focused preparation, focus on developing a functioning prototype that is aimed at the current customer base, easy to integrate, and related to existing products during the hackathon, had their projects continued in the case we studied. Moreover, we found indications for organizational commitment in the form of resources to continue a project after an event to predicate project integration. We also identified potential barriers towards this resource allocation related to prioritization and prior commitments of the organizational unit that was projected to continue a hackathon project after the event in the case we studied.","Leemet, Alar and Milani, Fredrik and Nolte, Alexander",,10.1109/CHASE52884.2021.00014,2021,10
inproceedings,A Systematic Mapping Study on the Organisation of Corporate Hackathons,"The hackathon phenomenon has just completed twenty years. During this period, it shifted from an event where highly skilled developers searched for bugs or randomly created a software solution to an organised event for exploring a set of technologies, challenges or themes. When promoted by software companies, these events are called corporate hackathons and mainly seek to improve their business activities by getting new ideas, prototypes or even business plans. By involving third parties, corporate hackathons become an open innovation strategy used by companies to ultimately leverage platforms and build a community of users around them, as a mechanism to establish a software ecosystem. This paper results from our motivation to understand how corporate hackathons are organised in IT industry. To achieve this goal, we performed a systematic mapping study on corporate hackathons, focusing on their process (i.e. steps involved in before, during and after a hackathon) and their main characteristics (goals, participants, duration, location, and application domain). As main contribution, we reveal organisation patterns and provide recommendations for companies aiming to conduct hackathons.","Valença, George and Lacerda, Nycolas and de Souza, Cleidson R B. and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/SEAA51224.2020.00074,2020,8
inproceedings,Effects of a Hackathon on the Motivation and Grades of CS1 Students,"Many educational institutions have modified their curricula to include computational thinking and coding courses for all students. However, it is not always easy to engage non-CS students in coding. Hackathons are often suggested as tools for exposing people to fun real challenges, promoting alternative ways of learning and increasing their interest in coding, and CS in general. Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students’ grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon. We also include suggestions as how to extend this study to further understand the effects of hackathons on the motivation and grades of CS1 students.","Bonilla, Rafael I. and Granda, Roger and Lozano, Estefanía",,10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125187,2020,6

The hackathon served as a pivot-point from bachelor studies and challenged students to collaborate, in a time-stressed situation, for achieving a common result. Within a time-bound of 2 days competitive event, participants have to collaborate to build proofs of concept and minimum viable products for specific topics with innovative perspectives. This type of hackathon realized with e.DO Cube offered various advantages, among them the inclusivity (gender gap) and agility, it promotes multidisciplinary collaboration, and it is an innovative method to promote new ideas and original POCs (Proof of Concepts) within Manufacturing 4.0 scope. The proposal also includes a study done by POLIMI to measure the effectiveness of this specific pedagogical approach towards specific learning outcomes.","Sullivan, Brendan P. and Rossi, Monica and Ramundo, Lucia and Rosa, Paolo and Terzi, Sergio",,10.1109/ICE/ITMC-IAMOT55089.2022.10033249,2022,6
article,Crowdsourcing Properties and Mechanisms of Mega Hackathons: The Case of Junction,"Hackathons are time-bounded crowdsourcing events, which have recently prospered in many technology and science domains across the globe. We study Europe’s largest hackathon, Junction, to better understand the distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of this type of hackathon as a form of tournament-based crowdsourcing. Moreover, we determined how they add value to attending companies and participants. In this regard, six qualitative and quantitative datasets from participants, companies, and the organizer were collected and analyzed. Our findings revealed five distinct crowdsourcing properties and mechanisms of mega hackathons, including intricate crowd selection, strong crowd vibe, instant crowd feedback, versatile crowd potential, and pervasive information technology. Based on our findings, we argue that these properties and mechanisms increase the possibility of finding innovative solutions to companies’ problems in Junction-like mega hackathons. This article concludes with managerial implications for companies to consciously plan and prepare while knowing what to expect during the hackathon.","Jaribion, Alireza and Khajavi, Siavash H. and Järvihaavisto, Ulriikka and Nurmi, Iiro and Gustafsson, Robin and Holmström, Jan",,10.1109/TEM.2021.3079107,2023,15
inproceedings,Opportunities and constraints of women-focused online hackathons,"Hackathons are often viewed as not being inclusive to women, who have low participation in these events. Reasons for this include low self-esteem in STEM fields, toxic environments, bad sleeping habits during the event, and a competitive atmosphere. Hackathons also can be a valuable opportunity for undergraduate students to improve their skills, but a lack of gender diversity can prevent women from taking advantage of these opportunities. Recently, initiatives have been implemented to increase the number of women participating in hackathons, such as women-only events, balancing participants by gender during the selection process, and using feminist and social themes for the hackathon. Our qualitative study investigated how event design choices (Focus on Women; Event support activities such as mentoring and pre-pitch; and Event warm-up activities) can influence the participant’s experience in a women-focused hackathon. Data was collected through surveys and semi-structured interviews with participants.","Paganini, Lavínia and Gama, Kiev and Nolte, Alexander and Serebrenik, Alexander",,10.1109/GEICSE59319.2023.00009,2023,8
inproceedings,Experiences and Lessons Learned from Onsite and Remote Teamwork Based Courses in Software Engineering,"Education is changing rapidly towards digital and online forms in universities. E.g. digitalization and Massively Open Online Course (MOOC)s evolve remote education tools, which changes the teaching approaches. Covid-19 accelerated digital transition from classroom-based education towards hybrid models, then online classes and finally to fully online education. While the education has moved from classrooms to Internet environment, the suitability of this transition has not really been evaluated. This is especially important to teamwork based courses in which the collaboration within teams and between teams is considered a major part of the learning outcomes of the course. Our study presents experiences on transforming a set of software engineering courses from a fully onsite course to a fully online course and lessons we have learned on that transition. We analyze hackathon and capstone style courses for traditional and remote execution modes. We have used hackathons for decades and have experience of different types of implementations. For capstones we have two different courses that we have experience with. Analyzing the team-based courses shows focal points which area hard to solve with online approaches. Online environment does not only make students faceless to the teacher but also to other teammates. This is especially visible in the long-lasting capstone courses.","Porras, Jari and Happonen, Ari and Khakurel, Jayden",,10.1109/ICoDSE53690.2021.9648490,2021,9
article,A Study of Cybersecurity Education Using a Present-Test-Practice-Assess Model,"Contribution: Based on a previous exploratory study, this research further investigated learning mode contributions from simulations and live competitive activities compared to a traditional classroom, laboratory, and testing approach to instruction in order to assess the applied behavioral contributions of each. Background: Cybersecurity capabilities in organizations lag behind the threats; consequently, there is a renewed emphasis on cybersecurity education. However, education appears to lack its full potential in most settings. Few empirical studies have systematically tested the efficacy of various training methods and modes, and those that have been conducted have yielded inconsistent findings. Recent literature on the use of gamified simulations have suggested that they may improve cybersecurity behaviors. Similarly, live activities, such as hackathons and capture the flag events, have been surmised to augment learning and capabilities. This study sought to systematically investigate this question. Research Questions: 1) Do cybersecurity simulations improve applied learning performance; 2) do live competitive activities improve applied learning performance; and 3) do any or each of these modes amplify applied learning performance when used in combination? Methodology: This study randomly assigned computer science students to one of four sections using different modalities. It used pretest scores on an applied exam as the co-variate, with post-test scores as the dependent variable. Results: Simulations improved learning performance over traditional classroom/lab instruction alone whereas live competitive activities did not. However, the greatest learning outcomes achieved was structured cybersecurity simulated environments combined with live competitive activities.","Workman, Michael D. and Luévanos, J.

inproceedings,Cybersecurity Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Proactive and Collaborative Learning Paradigm,"This Innovative Practice Work-in-Progress paper presents a virtual, proactive, and collaborative learning paradigm that can engage learners with different backgrounds and enable effective retention and transfer of the multidisciplinary AI-cybersecurity knowledge. While progress has been made to better understand the trustworthiness and security of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, little has been done to translate this knowledge to education and training. There is a critical need to foster a qualified cybersecurity workforce that understands the usefulness, limitations, and best practices of AI technologies in the cybersecurity domain. To address this import issue, in our proposed learning paradigm, we leverage multidisciplinary expertise in cybersecurity, AI, and statistics to systematically investigate two cohesive research and education goals. First, we develop an immersive learning environment that motivates the students to explore AI/machine learning (ML) development in the context of real-world cybersecurity scenarios by constructing learning models with tangible objects. Second, we design a proactive education paradigm with the use of hackathon activities based on game-based learning, lifelong learning, and social constructivism. The proposed paradigm will benefit a wide range of learners, especially underrepresented students. It will also help the general public understand the security implications of AI. In this paper, we describe our proposed learning paradigm and present our current progress of this ongoing research work. In the current stage, we focus on the first research and education goal and have been leveraging cost-effective Minecraft platform to develop an immersive learning environment where the learners are able to investigate the insights of the emerging AI/ML concepts by constructing related learning modules via interacting with tangible AI/ML building blocks.","Wei-Kocsis, Jin and Sabounchi, Moein and Yang, Baijian and Zhang, Tonglin",,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962643,2022,5
article,An Exploration of Hackathons as Time Intense and Collaborative Forms of Crowdsourcing,"Crowdsourcing has attracted increasing attention as an open innovation tool that enables firms to access the ideas and solutions of external crowds of participants. Among various crowdsourcing formats, hackathons have emerged as a form of collaborative crowdsourcing that emphasizes team-based collaboration among participants to co-create solutions to firms’ challenges under intense time pressures. Despite their increasing popularity, limited focus has been placed on understanding how hackathons should be organized and managed and the challenges that these time-intense collaborative events generate for both firms and participants. Based on a qualitative, multiple case study of six on-site hackathons, we identify and discuss four key design practices that shape these collaborative crowdsourcing forms, namely 1) problem formulation; 2) participant attraction and team composition; 3) developing the evaluation system; and 4) facilitating idea development. We show that these design practices are interrelated, with decisions about one design practice having important implications for the others, and discuss key challenges that arise from their combination. Overall, our findings highlight how organizing and managing hackathons is a complex matter that requires firms to adopt a more holistic and complementary approach. Implications for innovation management research and practice are discussed.","Beretta, Michela and Obwegeser, Nikolaus and Bauer, Stefan",,10.1109/TEM.2022.3174712,2022,15
inproceedings,Encourage students to apply their knowledge and think “out of the box” while collaborating with local industry - Case Study Industrial Seminar,"Our societies require talented engineers, who are trained in different engineering fields. Simultaneously these students should have the ability to collaborate and work with people of different disciplines and be able to look for innovation. Engineering programs have been developing different approaches to enhance these required skills, for example through capstones and hackathons. Capstones projects, which are often several months long, aim to prepare students for the transition from school to work. Frequently, these projects are designed to serve companies or startups. Hackathon events are intense and short sessions where students solve a challenge in short periods of time, often between 24 to 36 hours. However, it is needed an approach that exposes students, of different disciplines, to a wider number of industries with a more collaborative approach. We need interventions in which students can experience how their knowledge contributes to the innovation and visions of different stakeholders. Furthermore, these learning interventions, where we promote a collaborative experience among the participants where everybody learns from everybody, should require less time than with capstones or hackathons. The University of Turku developed the Industrial Seminar on Future Technologies course for master and phd advanced students, where we address: multidisciplinarity, collaboration, connection with engineering industry and innovation. Students in this course are exposed to challenges and visions of different companies in diverse domains, e.g. biotechnology, metal industry, maritime. Each seminar session focuses on one company, and we work together to address the session's aim in at most four hours. For each session participants have a pre-assignment, which is aligned to the objective of the session, and a post-assignment that focuses on the session's reflection. An important aspect to make each session successful is the preparation of the session with the local company. Hence this course addresses different objectives: (i) Expose students to industry, (ii) Students gain awareness of how their knowledge is relevant for different industry challenges and visions, (iii) Collaboration between session participants (from different backgrounds and from the guest company), (iv) Possibility to innovate (“think out of the box”), (v) University of Turku builds bridges with the local industry, as together with each guest company we go through a process of “sharpening” the company's challenge or vision for this particular seminar session. In this paper we analyze this course with its outcomes, utilizing the final results of each session, and the feedback from students and industry representatives.","Sedano, Carolina Islas and Vasankari, Timo",,10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637449,2021,8
article,Female Participation in Hackathons: A Case Study About Gender Issues in Application Development Marathons,"Hackathons are events that are a sort of application development marathons - lasting between 24 and 48 hours - that became increasingly popular as a method for fast learning and bring people in a short space of time to make creative projects. However, the number of women participating in these events is extremely low and worrying, even when considering multidisciplinary teams - including software engineers, designers, social educators, etc. This study is a step forward to understand the reasons for women being absent in this type of event. We sought for evidence on their behavior and concerns that could cause them avoiding such participation. For this, a case study was carried out in a female-focused hackathon, Hack Grrrl, which took place in the city of Recife, Brazil, in June 2019.","Paganini, Lavínia and Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/RITA.2020.3033209,2020,10

inproceedings,"Motivating and Demystifying IoT Learning with Hackathons in a Maker Space, Low-code Development and Rapid Prototyping","The ACM Computing Curricula 2020 states that the Internet of Things (IoT) is a field in computing that currently lacks an officially endorsed curriculum. This means that it is not yet considered a fully established academic discipline with a widely accepted curriculum that has been recognized or approved by organizations like ACM or IEEE. Given the rapid evolution and interdisciplinary nature of IoT, it can be challenging to determine the most appropriate content to include or exclude in IoT courses. This paper presents an elective course designed to quickly introduce students from Computer Science and Information Systems to the world of IoT. The course focuses on learning application-level communication protocols, the basics of rapid hardware prototyping with Raspberry Pi, and a low-code development tool (Node-RED) to quickly develop IoT applications. For their course project, students worked in teams during a weekend hackathon to build a working prototype of an IoT device with a Raspberry Pi, sensors, and actuators. The hackathon took place in a maker space in the information technology innovation park of the region. The paper provides feedback from 29 students from the two cohorts that took the course, and the qualitative data analysis shows that this approach indeed lowered the barrier to computer science and information systems students having their first contact with IoT development.","Gama, Kiev",,10.1109/SERP4IoT59158.2023.00009,2023,8

inproceedings,Development of individual learning paths system in engineering education,"This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents development of individual learning paths system in engineering education using the example of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI). A set of technological approaches, called Industry 4.0, appeared about 10 years ago. The modern technological era is inextricably linked with project management, integrated programs and research, IT solutions, including the use of artificial intelligence in all areas of activity, as well as with interdisciplinary approaches. Therefore, a new interactive environment of education and science is emerging among universities, research centers, industry and enterprises.The new environment puts forward new personnel training requirements. Taking into account the explosive pace of development and introduction of technologies, today advanced engineering universities together with the industry form a realtime forecast of personnel needs and the map of competencies of the future. The system of engineering education is based on the principles of individualization of educational and professional paths, practical orientation, development of soft skills, mobility. Personal education path - it's not just a student's choice, but it's very labor-intensive, properly designed work of educational institution, where not only the whole university is engaged, but also its partner employers.The Moscow Aviation Institute is implementing the integrated concept of ""personalization"". The peculiarity of individual learning path at the university is that at the first stage of its formation the potential direction and place of professional activity are determined, the necessary competencies to be acquired are accounted, and an individual development plan is formed. The holders of the typical student paths at Moscow Aviation Institute are the internal employer-divisions - Competency Centers, which have become the integrators of forward-looking technologies and are conducting a large number of projects commissioned by the industry. Also, the MAI Competence Centers help students to form the path to the professions in demand in the future, providing an opportunity for practice and mastering additional engineering, technological and managerial competences.Students comprehend their personal learning pathways at three levels. First at the level of the educational program through the identification of elective courses and places of practice after consultation with the tutor. Second, at the academic level, they master the chapters and topics that are the most relevant to student's current or future professional activity. Finally, a committed student can use internships, hackathons, Academic exchange and many other ways to form a unique path, outside the formal learning process.At the same time, an important task is the formation of healthy competition between students in obtaining access to certain modules of individual path.","Pogosyan, Mikhail A.",,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274140,2020,8

The design thinking (DT) methodology was followed, involving multidisciplinary teams of engineering and design students, who collaboratively proposed solutions presented with conceptual videos and posters. Each social organization was allocated with several teams that addressed its challenges, considered in our context as a micro-crowd (MC). We performed a study for examining the influence of the collaborative environment on the MCs’ requirements engineering (RE) activities, and specifically how the structured online boards facilitate the DT process. Following a qualitative analysis of the shared boards, our findings indicate the ways in which the shared collaborative tool and the multidisciplinary nature of the MCs contributed to the high-quality outcomes developed by the teams. We further propose the concept of parallel MC-based RE referring to teams of multidisciplinary developers working in parallel for developing many ideas in a timely and creative manner.","Levy, Meira and Hadar, Irit and Krebs, Assaf and Barak, Idit",,10.1109/REW53955.2021.00055,2021,7

The success of a smart city, however, also relies on the competencies of its citizens, suggesting a re-modelling of engineering education towards a learner-centred, competency-based education. This paper gives an overview of the challenges encountered throughout implementing the BIOART multinational curriculum development project. A project that tackled the challenges for an inclusive, resilient smart city concept by developing novel teaching and learning content and adopting innovative educational methodologies in biomedical engineering, a.o. in the context of an internationally organised summer school and online hackathon.","Luengo, David and Treytl, Albert and Nestawal, Stephanie and Arras, Peter and Korniejenko, Kinga and Tabunshchyk, Galyna and Trigano, Tom",,10.1109/E-TEMS53558.2022.9944453,2022,6
inproceedings,Hands-on Learning Modules for Upskilling in Industry 4.0 Technologies,"The Industry 4.0 (I4.0) advent is re-shaping the way systems and processes operate by considering Cyber- Physical Systems combined with a plethora of emergent Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Intelligent Robotics. However, the emergence of such disruptive technologies strongly establishes a demand for upskilling and requalification of active professionals and young undergraduate students. This means that the wide adoption of the 14.0 systems and related tech-nologies is dependent on the efficient implementation of lifelong learning and training initiatives that address these challenges. Having this in mind, this paper describes the implementation of a series of short learning modules and hackathons that relies on a strong hands-on practical experimentation, regarding the upskilling in emergent ICT technologies, particularly focusing on IoT, mobile robotics and Multi-agent Systems. The preliminary efforts contributed to qualify undergraduate students and active professionals in disruptive ICT, with the attendees' feedback illustrating the importance of these kind of short and hands-on learning modules to address towards the continuous demands associated to the diaital transformation.","Oliveira, Alexandre and Assumpcao, Heitor and Queiroz, Jonas and Piardi, Luis and Parra, Javier and Leitao, Paulo",,10.1109/ICPS51978.2022.9816909,2022,6
inproceedings,Machine Learning based Predicting House Prices using Regression Techniques,"Predictive models for determining the sale price of houses in cities like Bengaluru is still remaining as more challenging and tricky task. The sale price of properties in cities like Bengaluru depends on a number of interdependent factors. Key factors that might affect the price include area of the property, location of the property and its amenities. In this research work, an analytical study has been carried out by considering the data set that remains open to the public by illustrating the available housing properties in machine hackathon platform. The data set has nine features. In this study, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on the factors that affect the price. Modeling explorations apply some regression techniques such as multiple linear regression (Least Squares), Lasso and Ridge regression models, support vector regression, and boosting algorithms such as Extreme Gradient Boost Regression (XG Boost). Such models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on the predictive errors obtained between these models. Here, the attempt is to construct a predictive model for evaluating the price based on factors that affects the price.","Manasa, J and Gupta, Radha and Narahari, N S",,10.1109/ICIMIA48430.2020.9074952,2020,7
article,Video Game Development in a Rush: A Survey of the Global Game Jam Participants,"Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several studies have reported that periods of “crunch time” are prevalent in the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration, minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities. Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic “crunch time” and argue that game jam organizers are in a good position to problematize the phenomenon.","Borg, Markus and Garousi, Vahid and Mahmoud, Anas and Olsson, Thomas and Stålberg, Oskar",,10.1109/TG.2019.2910248,2020,14
article,Evaluating Processes to Certify Mobile Applications During Developer Relations Activities,"In a Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO), the software organizations have opened up their structures to third-party developers aiming to reach goals to ensure the MSECO is working properly, such as increasing number of users, mobile applications (apps) and developers. Thus, the management organization (keystone) by their Developer Relations (DevRel) teams must restructure its processes to support third-party developers and create ways to attract the development of apps. The development of apps during events planned and conducted by DevRel team (e.g., hackathons or developer conferences) requires an approach that allows developers to achieve the expected performance into the MSECO. However, there is a quality contribution barrier, the App Store, the App Store's criteria do not guarantee that apps certified by these criteria have good performance in number of downloads and positive reviews into the MSECO. Aims: We present an evaluation of a mobile certification approach for the MSECO context, called MSECO-CERT (Mobile Software ECOsystem app CERTification), in terms of mobile application downloads, ratings and changes in developers' attitudes. MSECO-CERT comprises support (MSECO-SUP) and development (MSECO-DEV) processes. We describe two empirical studies: feasibility and observational. MSECO-CERT produced a growth coefficient of downloads (363%) and average user ratings (28%) when compared to an ad hoc approach. We observed that the DevRel practitioners (i.e., developer evangelists) and most of the developers (70%) considered MSECO-SUP and MSECO-DEV processes easy to use. They indicate that they would use both processes in the future. The results indicate that a keystone needs to invest in the analysis of their certification processes considering the ecosystem elements and also create mechanisms that allow monitoring the effect of DevRel activities. Our studies also helped to evolve MSECO-CERT by refining roles, activities and artifacts.","Fontão, Awdren and Paes, Pedro and Ekwoge, Oswald and Santos, Rodrigo Pereira Dos and Dias-Neto, Arilo Claudio",,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009921,2020,15
article,Advanced Ensemble Model for Solar Radiation Forecasting Using Sine Cosine Algorithm and Newton’s Laws,"As research in alternate energy sources is growing, solar radiation is catching the eyes of the research community immensely. Since solar energy generation depends on uncontrollable natural variables, without proper forecasting, this energy source cannot be trusted. For this forecasting, the use of machine learning algorithms is one of the best choices. This paper proposed an optimized solar radiation forecasting ensemble model consisting of pre-processing and training ensemble phases. The training ensemble phase works on an advanced sine cosine algorithm (ASCA) using Newton’s laws of gravity and motion for objects (agents). ASCA uses sine and cosine functions to update the agent’s position/velocity components by considering its mass. The training ensemble model is then developed using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) regression. The performance of the proposed ensemble model is measured using a dataset from Kaggle (Solar Radiation Prediction, Task from NASA Hackathon). The proposed ASCA algorithm is evaluated in comparison with the Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Hybrid Greedy Sine Cosine Algorithm with Differential Evolution (HGSCADE), Hybrid Modified Sine Cosine Algorithm with Cuckoo Search Algorithm (HMSCACSA), Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA), Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), and Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA). Obtained results of the proposed ensemble model are compared with those of state-of-the-art models, and significant superiority of the proposed ensemble model is confirmed using statistical analysis such as ANOVA and Wilcoxon’s rank-sum tests.","El-Kenawy, El-Sayed M. and Mirjalili, Seyedali and Ghoneim, Sherif S.

inproceedings,Role of Indian Higher Education Institutions towards Aatmanirbhar India: Government Policies and Initiatives to promote Entrepreneurship and Innovation,"The Prime Minister of India in 2020 announced his vision of Aatmanirbhar India to make India an economically self-reliant nation. He shared this vision while announcing the 1st economic package to support the Indian population during the COVID19 pandemic. He believed Aatmanirbhar India could be achieved through pursuing policies that are competent, efficient, and resilient along with being self-generating and self-sustaining. This vision was well aligned and would contribute significantly to India's plan of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025. However, achieving this vision would have required systemic changes in India's DNA as a larger section of the India population needed to become Innovators and Entrepreneurs. One element of adapting to this new DNA was envisioned through the development of innovation and entrepreneurial mindset among the youth of the country. It was important to capitalize on the potential of the young minds and awaken the innovators among the students in K-12 and especially higher education. In the last 3 years, the Ministry of Education (previously Ministry of Human Resource Development) along with other central organizations such as the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) etc have come up with a range of policies and initiatives, all strategically aligned to foster an ecosystem for entrepreneurship and innovation (I&E) in higher education institutions (HEIs). In this paper, we highlight a set of initiatives and policies launched up by the government of India to promote entrepreneurship and innovation in HEI's. We elaborate on the National Startup and Innovation Policy, New Education Policy (NEP) along with national initiatives such as Smart India Hackathon, ARIAA (National I&E ranking) and others. Case-studies are presented of noteworthy HEI's who have transformed themselves by using the government's efforts as catalysts to nurture I&E. At the end, we highlight the potential of HEI's in India to collectively contribute to helping India become Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) in the post-Pandemic world.","Kandakatla, Rohit and Aluvalu, Rajanikanth and Devireddy, Sreedevi and Kulkarni, Nitin and Joshi, Gopal",,10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657261,2021,7
article,"Factors Influencing Hackathon Adoption for Learning Information
Technology (IT) Programming Modules","Hackathon as a social event has been identified as a method that assists
participants collaborate and solve technical design challenges in a
limited time. With the numerous hackathon potentials, its significance
in computer and IT programming courses have not been fully explored for
teaching and learning. The hackathon concept has been in existence for
some times, and research on the adoption of hackathon has been limited
to the industry but not much in education. This paper endeavours to
investigate the factors that influence hackathon adoption in the
academic sector particularly in higher education. Quantitative research
was undertaken; a survey was administered to a sample of 249 South
African IT programming students. The results indicate that relative
advantage (beta = 0.142, rho = 0.045), perceived usefulness (beta =
0.205, rho = 0.036), performance expectancy (beta = 0.205, rho = 0.002)
and self-efficacy (beta = 0.330, rho = 0.000) have a positive influence
on the behavioural intention of students to adopt hackathon for learning
IT programming. The hackathon adoption model was developed for higher
education. This research helps in the adoption of hackathons in higher

article,"Healthcare hackathons: fostering medical education through innovation in
a developing country: a case study from Pakistan","Background Hackathons aim to develop solutions to preidentified problem
domains and catalyse startup cultures. Recently, the teaching and
learning potential of hackathons has also been documented. In this
study, we make the case for utilisation of hackathons as an alternative
teaching and learning tool geared towards entrepreneurship and as an
opportunity for interprofessional integration.
Methods This research study followed up with participants from the third
hackathon at the Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. Hack MedEd
was about solutions to problems of undergraduate and postgraduate
medical education with an emphasis on low--income to middle-income
countries. Participant evaluation data were filled at the end of the
hackathon and gathered from three focused group discussions (FGDs):
immediately before and after the event, a delayed follow-up after 11
months was recorded.
Results Of 116 participants, the majority (71\%) were under 30 years
old, and over half were female. The evaluations provided by hackers were
positive overall with a mean score of 4.37 out of 5 on a Likert Scale.
During the FGDs, participants spoke positively of the process and felt
that, by the end of the hackathon, they had learnt something new. In the
delayed follow-up FGD, teams that had undergone incubation expressed
that they had gained a critical and simple skillset that they might not
have acquired otherwise.
Conclusion Hackathons business incubation programmes may be considered
an alternative teaching and learning tool-especially for individuals
studying or working within the healthcare discipline within
low--resource settings.","Butt, Waqaas Akmal and Shahood, Qurratulain and Farooqi, Walid Hussain

article,Using the Hackathon Model in Social Work Education,"A recent innovation adapted from the world of commercial computer
hacking is known as a Hackathon event. Hackathons are characterized by
problem-solving in small groups, under time pressure, to develop
creative solutions to a challenging problem. This paper presents the
evaluation of a Hackathon applied in two courses on trauma-informed
practice (one BSW and the other at MSW level). Students (N = 57)
developed interventions to address group and community trauma presented
in case studies. Social work doctoral students served as judges (N = 5),
evaluated the presentations and selected the winning team. The
evaluation showed that the students and judges felt that the Hackathon
promoted learning, creativity, teamwork and the incorporation of
concepts learned in the course. The competitiveness and being judged
were viewed as negative aspects by the students and the judges concurred
that the competition detracted from the educational experience. More
research is needed on how to apply the Hackathon model to other types of
social work curricula including the teaching of various research
methods. The current COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the social work
profession to address its myriad social implications. How to adapt
social work practice toward the incorporation of e-therapy and

article,Hackathons: what do engineering educators think about it?,"Purpose With past studies indicating a lack of skill development in
engineering education, there is a need for new pedagogical tools that
are application and skill-oriented. Hackathons are widely accepted in
the corporate world, in the engineering domain for skill development and
recruitment but have not gained acceptance in mainstream engineering
education. Very few studies have discussed engineering educator views
regarding hackathons and their benefits. This paper intends to study
engineering educators' perception of the hackathon and its benefits
after participating in it. The findings could support hackathons as a
pedagogical tool to develop an industry-oriented and skill-based
engineering education. Design/methodology/approach A mixed methods
design was employed where initially qualitative study was conducted. Its
findings were used to conduct survey of 162 engineering educators who
had participated in a hackathon. A five point Likert scale was employed
for data collection. Findings The findings reveal that engineering
educators who participated in the hackathon perceived hackathons to
support industry-focused learning, problem-solving and new skill
development. They also acknowledged its role in their professional
development. The further discussion suggests that engineering educators
and institutes may collaborate with industry to design and use
hackathons as a teaching tool to develop industry-ready graduates.
Research limitations/implications The study was not designed to study
how different aspects of hackathon lead to different benefits derived
from participating in it. There is a need to study hackathons as a tool
of pedagogy and assessment, focusing on how variables linked to it
facilitate, moderate and hinder the learning and assessment process in
participants. More in-depth studies need to be conducted to adopt the
hackathon as a pedagogy and assessment tool in higher education.
Practical implications The discussion suggests that designing hackathons
effectively as a tool for learning and skill development will result in
skilled graduates. Engineering educators should adopt hackathons as a
pedagogy for their students. Management and policymakers of engineering
institutes should consider hackathons as a part of pedagogy for students
besides conducting hackathons for educators for their professional
development that will be investment in skills helpful at workplace.
Originality/value The notable contribution of this paper is to document
perceptions of engineering educators regarding hackathons and their
benefits after participating in a hackathon. The paper proposes that
hackathons can be introduced in the engineering curriculum as they would
offer educators a novel method of teaching and assessment and support
engineering graduates in recruitment and making them industry-ready.","Mehta, Neha and Bist, Siddarth Singh and Shah, Priya","Engineering educators; Hackathon; Pedagogical tool; Professional

article,"Engaging Engineering Students in Public Health Responses to Disease
Outbreaks Through Hackathons","Contribution: Although engineering hackathon events are common, this is
one of the first reports of such an event used for the purpose of
teaching engineering students about public health concepts. Results from
this study suggest that hackathons are an effective format for teaching
topics that are not core to the engineering discipline in a short period
of time. Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the
essential role that computer scientists and engineers have in
controlling disease outbreaks. However, engineering programs generally
do not provide training on public health issues. Thus, there is a
critical need to develop innovative and engaging ways to educate
engineering students about public health without interfering with
required discipline-specific content. Intended Outcomes: Hackathons,
short-term events, held outside of the classroom, can provide an
engaging and effective method for increasing the interest and knowledge
of engineering students in disease outbreaks. In this article, the
effectiveness of a hack day in increasing the interest and knowledge of
engineering students in disease outbreaks is assessed. Application
Design: One-hundred-six undergraduate students, 30 of whom were
engineering majors, participated in a multidisciplinary disease focused
hackathon. Student learning and engagement during the hackathon was
assessed for the 30 engineering students that participated through pre-
and post-event surveys. Findings: The results indicated that the
hackathon increased both content knowledge and engagement of engineering
students in public health issues. Additionally, students gained an
increased understanding of public health professions and how they can
contribute to disease tracking, prevention, and treatment. Therefore,
hackathons are an effective and efficient tool for teaching engineering
students about topics outside of their discipline.","Pakpour, Nazzy and Nouredini, Sahar and Tandon, James","Public healthcare; Engineering students; Diseases; Medical services;

article,"Fostering interdisciplinary working within global surgery at an
undergraduate level: A hackathon based approach","Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a virtual hackathon in
fostering interdisciplinary working amongst undergraduate students in
global surgery.
Methodology: In this study, we developed a 3 day event consisting of
guest lectures, a documentary screening and a hackathon supported by
academics and experts in the field, to provide students with the
opportunity to learn more about and work in interdisciplinary teams
within global surgery. Students had the option to attend just the
lectures or both the lectures and hackathon. Quantitative and
qualitative results were collected through a pre and post session
survey.
Results: A total of 21 responses were received for the hackathon and 26
responses for the general event (response rate for event = 26 \%,
response rate for hackathon = 24.7 \%). There was a significant
improvement in understanding of interdisciplinary working in global
surgery between the pre and post-session survey, with an increase in
median from 3 (IQR = 2-3.5, n = 21) to 4 (IQR = 4-5, n = 21) (p < 0.05).
Respondents noted that the benefits of a hackathon were that it was very
engaging, and brought in diversity of thought and expertise. The
drawbacks to the hackathon were that it was fast-paced, required prior
knowledge and the virtual platform it was hosted on.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that hackathons are an effective,
inclusive and equitable way for students to engage in and learn about
interdisciplinary working. It is important that as institutions
recognise and develop global surgery courses, these courses reflect the
interdisciplinary nature of the field.","Veerappan, Vigneshwar R. and Kumar, Niraj S. and Selvakumar, Jashan and

Steering planetary and human health towards a more sustainable future
demands educated and prepared health professionals.
Aim
This research aimed: to explore health professions educators'
sustainable healthcare education (SHE) knowledge, attitudes,
self-efficacy and teaching practices across 13 health professions
courses in one Australian university.
Methods
Utilising a sequential mixed-methods design: Phase one (understanding)
involved an online survey to ascertain educators' SHE knowledge,
attitudes, self-efficacy and teaching practices to inform phase two
(solution generation), `Teach Green' Hackathon. Survey data was
descriptively analysed and a gap analysis performed to promote
generation of solutions during phase two. Results from the hackathon
were thematically analysed to produce five recommendations.
Results
Regarding SHE, survey data across 13 health professions disciplines (n =
163) identified strong content knowledge (90.8\%); however, only
(36.9\%) reported confidence to `explain' and (44.2\%) to `inspire'
students. Two thirds of participants (67.5\%) reported not knowing how
best to teach SHE. Hackathon data revealed three main influencing
factors: regulatory, policy and socio-cultural drivers.
Conclusions

article,"Platform diffusion at temporary gatherings: Social coordination and
ecosystem emergence","Research Summary Software platforms create value by cultivating an
ecosystem of complementary products and services. Existing explanations
for how a prospective complementor chooses platforms to join assume the
complementor has rich information about the range of available
platforms. However, complementors lack this information in many
ecosystems, raising the question of how complementors learn about
platforms in the first place. We investigate whether attending a
temporary gathering-a hackathon-impacts the platform choices of software
developers. Through a large-scale quantitative study of 1,302 developers
and 167 hackathons, supported by qualitative research, we analyze the
multiple channels-sponsorship, social learning, knowledge exchange, and
social coordination-through which hackathons serve as a social forum for
the diffusion of platform adoption among attendees. Managerial Summary A
software platform such as Windows, iOS, or Amazon Web Services relies on
third-party developers to create applications that complement the
platform and make it valuable for end users. However, developers face a
wide range of possible platforms, and they may have limited information
about which platforms would be worthwhile to develop for. A software
platform business can educate and encourage developers to adopt their
platform by supporting in-person software development competitions,
known as hackathons. Developers learn about prospective platforms that
advertise at the hackathon. Developers also learn whether and how to use
a platform by observing and teaching one other. Hackathons are
particularly useful for spreading platform technologies: developers
prefer to adopt widely used platforms, and hackathons permit developers
to identify and join fashionable platforms.","Fang, Tommy Pan and Wu, Andy and Clough, David R.","complex contagions; hackathons; innovation ecosystems; multisided

Practices from the technology industry may offer innovative strategies
for fostering transformational learning experiences. We developed and
implemented two innovation techniques-Hackathon and Innovation Time Off
(ITO)-in a graduate course on social psychology and public health
nutrition. The Hackathon occurred in the sixth and seventh weeks of the
course; the last 4 weeks provided 10\% of class time for ITO projects.
All enrolled students participated in the pilot study (n = 6; M age =
27.5 years; 83\% female; 67\% White) and completed reflection papers
during the final exam period. Student learning was assessed from these
reflection papers using a rubric for transformative versus
nontransformative changes in five areas: confidence, pride, skills,
perspective, and identity. Student responses revealed transformative
changes in perspective (n = 7). Additionally, nontransformative changes
were found in confidence (n = 1), identity (n = 2), perspective (n = 4),
and skills (n = 9). This pilot work suggests that the Hackathon and ITO
contributed to perceived skill-building in problem-solving and teamwork,

by establishing a nexus between practical, theoretical, and technical
dimensions of teaching and learning. In the modern age of education,
hackathons are becoming increasingly prominent in providing an optimal
academic environment that connects classroom learnings to real-life
scenarios. This study explored the motivational orientation behind
student participation in hackathons through the framework provided by
self-determination theory. Specifically, it investigated the role of
intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in encouraging initial and
continuous hackathon participation. The partial least squares-structural
equation modeling method was used to analyze data collected from 437
students in 12 countries. According to the findings, although intrinsic
motivation influences participation intention, extrinsic motivation
drives continuance participation. When intrinsic and extrinsic
motivational constructs were analyzed individually, it was found that
continuance participation demands both motivational orientations.
Comparisons of demographic characteristics indicate that older students
with more extensive educational experience may have higher intentions to
participate and continue participating in these events. This study

sets can be linked together as a graph representation, with nodes

Reasoning and inference algorithms can then be applied to the KG and
used to generate new knowledge. We developed three KG-based
question-answering systems as part of the Biomedical Data Translator

article,A classification of Challenges encountered in Complex Teamwork Settings,"Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments may at
times become socio-emotionally tense and pose challenges that may have
detrimental effects on mutual trust and shared mental models. Objective.
This study aims to examine and classify general teamwork challenges in a
novel but authentic CSCL setting (hackathon) to identify challenges that
impede the development of key team coordination mechanisms (i.e., mutual
trust and shared mental models). Methods. Multimodal data including
responses to an adapted questionnaire (AIRE), post-competition interview
data, and videos of team interaction were collected during an
international hackathon event (N=48, 71\% male, M=22 years age).
Qualitative theory-driven coding and theme development were used to
analyze the multimodal dataset (Greeno, 2006; Jarvenoja et al., 2013).
Results. Our analyses revealed 16 general challenges that hamper
teamwork in a hackathon. A model of team challenges was developed to
categorize challenges into macro level themes including cognitive,
motivational, emotional and behavioral challenges. We also identified
which challenges hindered the development of mutual trust, and which
challenges hindered the development of shared mental models.

article,"Global Leaders for Global Teams: Leaders with Multicultural Experiences
Communicate and Lead More Effectively, Especially in Multinational Teams","In an era of globalization, it is commonly assumed that multicultural
experiences foster leadership effectiveness. However, little research
has systematically tested this assumption. We develop a theoretical
perspective that articulates how and when multicultural experiences
increase leadership effectiveness. We hypothesize that broad
multicultural experiences increase individuals' leadership effectiveness
by developing their communication competence. Because communication
competence is particularly important for leading teams that are more
multinational, we further hypothesize that individuals with broader
multicultural experiences are particularly effective when leading more
versus less multinational teams. Four studies test our theory using
mixed methods (field survey, archival panel, field experiments) and
diverse populations (corporate managers, soccer managers, hackathon
leaders) in different countries (Australia, Britain, China, America). In
Study 1, corporate managers with broader multicultural experiences were
rated as more effective leaders, an effect mediated by communication
competence. Analyzing a 25-year archival panel of English Premier League
soccer managers, Study 2 replicates the positive effect of broad
multicultural experiences using a team performance measure of leadership
effectiveness. Importantly, this effect was moderated by team national
diversity: soccer managers with broader multicultural experiences were
particularly effective when leading teams with greater national
diversity. Study 3 (digital health hackathon) and Study 4 (COVID-19
policy hackathon) replicate these effects in two field experiments, in
which individuals with varying levels of multicultural experiences were
randomly assigned to lead hackathon teams that naturally varied in
national diversity. Overall, our research suggests that broad

lead more effectively, especially when leading multinational teams.","Lu, Jackson G. and Swaab, Roderick I. and Galinsky, Adam D.","globalization; culture; diversity; multicultural experiences;

a quantitative and qualitative descriptive analyses from a crowdsourcing
open call and online hackathon","Introduction Young people have played a pivotal role as part of the
COVID-19 response, including developing health messages and social
innovations. Social innovation in health engages multiple stakeholders
in linking social change and health improvement. The study examined the
feasibility of youth ideas and innovations to address the impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative descriptive
analyses.
Methods In partnership with the WHO, academic institutions, youth
organisations and civil society groups, we conducted a crowdsourcing
open call among Filipino youth (15-30 years old) using a structured
Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases/Social
Innovation in Health Initiative process. The open call had three
categories: youth voices to cocreate the post-COVID-19 world (entries
were texts, images, videos and music), youth-led COVID-19 social
innovations, and youth-led social innovations not related to COVID-19.
Each submission was evaluated by three independent judges. Finalists
were selected in each of the categories alongside four grand winners.
All finalists were invited to attend a 1day online civic hackathon.
Results We received a total of 113 entries (youth voices to cocreate the
post-COVID world=76; youth-led COVID-19 social innovations=17; youth-led
social innovations not related to COVID-19=20). Twelve entries focused
on youth mental health during the pandemic. The online hackathon
provided the participants mentorship for further development of their
ideas. Finalists were able to produce draft health communication
campaigns and improved social innovations.
Conclusion Many Filipino youth created exceptional entries in response
to the open call. This suggests the feasibility of including youth
voices in strategic planning processes. A global youth social innovation
call is recommended.","Ulitin, Allan and Mier-Alpano, Jana Deborah and Labarda, Meredith and

for virtual teams to share knowledge among their team members and
develop transactive memory systems (TMS). Adopting the media affordances
lens, the current study investigates how social media affordances affect
individual evaluations of TMS development and perceived team
effectiveness in virtual teams. Survey data from 339 virtual team
members across 92 hackathon events reveal that types of affordances have
differing impacts on each of the three dimensions of TMS (perceptions of
accuracy, sharedness, and validation). Furthermore, each dimension of
perceived TMS mediates the relationship between its related social media
affordance types and perceived team effectiveness. These findings
suggest that virtual teams may need to adopt different social media

case study of smart city hackathons in Tampere, Finland","Public procurement of innovation is a key policy instrument for
improving the quality of public services and achieving wider benefits
for society. Recently, innovation contests have re-emerged as a means to

We find that innovation contests may be used for, not only sourcing
novel technologies, but also for engaging in conversations with
companies, and developing an understanding of local problems and

article,"Who captures value from hackathons? Innovation contests with collective
intelligence tools bridging creativity and coupled open innovation","Balancing value creation and value capture is a fundamental strategic
issue for the management of open innovation. Insufficient compensation
for created value may hinder the participation of a firm or individual
in open innovation. It can thus provide an obstacle to the open
innovation process as a whole. Hackathons provide an attractive setting
for studying value appropriation in open innovation by actors of
different types and with varying bargaining power. We define hackathons
as idea competitions on specific topics in the form of a time-limited
event. These competitions have gained more popularity throughout the
years and have recently become more prominent. Therefore, an abductive
empirical study was carried out in an international set-up with multiple
embedded cases of hackathons. Results indicate that hackathons offer
coupled open innovation processes. The value captured by the initiator
of a hackathon in the form of inbound open innovation is balanced by
outbound knowledge flows towards participants as well as with sideways
knowledge flows between participants, which are a result of the
generation of collective intelligence. Collective intelligence is thus
identified as an alternative mechanism for value capture from open
innovation.","Attalah, Issam and Nylund, Petra A. and Brem, Alexander","collective intelligence; creativity; hackathon; innovation; open

article,"Video Game Development in a Rush: A Survey of the Global Game Jam
Participants","Video game development is a complex endeavor, often involving complex
software, large organizations, and aggressive release deadlines. Several
studies have reported that periods of ``crunch time{''} are prevalent in
the video game industry, but there are few studies on the effects of
time pressure. We conducted a survey with participants of the Global
Game Jam (GGJ), a 48-h hackathon. Based on 198 responses, the results
suggest the following: iterative brainstorming is the most popular
method for conceptualizing initial requirements; continuous integration,
minimum viable product, scope management, version control, and stand-up
meetings are frequently applied development practices; regular
communication, internal playtesting, and dynamic and proactive planning
are the most common quality assurance activities; and familiarity with
agile development has a weak correlation with perception of success in
the GGJ. We conclude that GGJ teams rely on ad hoc approaches to the
development and face-to-face communication, and recommend some
complementary practices with limited overhead. Furthermore, as our
findings are similar to recommendations for software startups, we posit
that game jams and the startup scene share contextual similarities.
Finally, we discuss the drawbacks of systemic ``crunch time{''} and

the phenomenon.","Borg, Markus and Garousi, Vahid and Mahmoud, Anas and Olsson, Thomas and

group","Creating accessible events is a pressing issue for many music
organisations. In the United States, the term accessibility has strong
ties to disability, and it is an important concept because what is
deemed accessible directly impacts who is included and excluded from
music experiences. Music Community Lab (MCL) runs a series of events in
New York City called Monthly Music Hackathon NYC. They aim to promote
`diversity across backgrounds, perspectives, and abilities'. This
instrumental case study sought to examine how MCL participants
conceptualise accessibility as well as analyze participants' suggestions
for improving the accessibility of MCL events. Sixty-two people who
attended one of three MCL events completed a demographic survey and 57
of those respondents participated in an interview. Findings reveal that
63\% (n = 36) of participants associated accessibility with inclusivity
and 35\% (n = 20) of participants associated accessibility with ease of
access to resources, places, and experiences. Participants' suggestions
for improving accessibility included social media marketing (n = 23;
40\%) and ease of access approaches (n = 11; 19\%) including CART, ASL,

article,Inter-Model Comparison for Tsunami Debris Simulation,"Assessing the risk of tsunami-driven debris has increasingly been
recognized as an important design consideration. The recent ASCE/SEI7-16
standard Chapter 6 requires all the areas included within a 22.5.
spreading angle from the debris source to consider the debris impact.
However, it would be more reasonable to estimate the risks using
numerical simulation models. Although a number of simulation models to
predict tsunami debris transport have been proposed individually,
comparative studies for these simulation models have rarely been
conducted. Thus, in the present study, an inter-model comparison for
tsunami debris simulation model was performed as a part of the virtual
Tsunami Hackathon held in Japan from September 1 to 3 in 2020. The blind
benchmarking experiment, which recorded the transport of three container
models under a tsunami-like bore, was conducted to generate a unique
dataset. Then, four different numerical models were applied to reproduce
the experiments. Simulated results demonstrated considerable differences
among the simulation models. Essentially, the importance of accurate
modelling of a flow field, especially a tsunami front, was confirmed to
be important in simulating debris motion. Parametric studies performed
in each model and comparisons between different models also confirmed
that a drag coefficient and inertia coefficient would influence the
simulated debris trajectory and velocity. It was also shown that two-way
coupled modelling to express the interaction between debris and a
tsunami is important to accurately model the debris motion.","Takabatake, Tomoyuki and Stolle, Jacob and Hiraishi, Koji and Kihara,

article,"Transactive Memory Systems, Temporary Teams, and Conflict:
Innovativeness During a Hackathon","The transactive memory system has been studied extensively, yet we still
know little about how it influences the effectiveness of temporary
teams. Additionally, little is known about the boundary conditions of
the well-established benefits of transactive memory systems on team
performance. Our primary goal in this study is to build and test a
theory that investigates the influence of a transactive memory system on
the performance of temporary teams while accounting for conditional
effects of both task and relationship conflict. On the surface, a
transactive memory systems perspective may seem incompatible with
temporary teams. Transactive memory systems typically require time or
team member familiarity to develop. However, team members on temporary
teams often are selected because of their expertise, not team member
familiarity, and often must quickly and effectively operate under time
and outcome pressures. We present a theory that suggests transactive
memory systems should have a meaningful influence on temporary teams,
and its effect is accentuated in the presence of task conflict and
attenuated in the presence of relationship conflict. We test our theory
using a sample of 202 teams participating in the Global Game Jam, the
world's largest hackathon devoted to designing and developing games
within a 48-h period. In addition to implications for literatures on
transactive memory systems and temporary teams, our study adds to a

attentional functions","Background Recent research has established virtual reality (VR)
applications as a valid and viable tool for neuropsychological
assessment. In contrast, there are only a few studies on its potential
as a therapeutic program. To examine the prospects of VR as a tool for
functional rehabilitation, a VR training program of attentional
functions was conceptualized during a Hackathon in 2018. The prototype
of the immersive VR training program takes the patient on a virtual
journey around the world (VR Traveller). In different locations around
the globe, patients exercise different subcomponents of attention in a
visually appealing and ecologically valid environment. Objective To
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and tolerability of the newly
developed VR Traveller prototype for neurorehabilitation training.
Method Thirty-five patients with acquired brain injury and mild to
moderate attention deficits were instructed to complete the VR Traveller
training program in a 20-30 min session during inpatient
neurorehabilitation. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed with
the user experience questionnaire (UEQ) and a self-constructed
feasibility questionnaire, and tolerability was assessed with the
virtual reality sickness questionnaire (VRSQ). Results Analyses of the
UEQ and the feasibility questionnaire yield evidence for a high
acceptance among most patients. The VRSQ data suggest that symptoms of
VR sickness were hardly experienced. Conclusion Patients' ratings of the
VR training in terms of acceptability and feasibility were positive,
suggesting that VR programs represent an accepted, feasible, and

PREVENT A NEW OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The purpose of this study was to determine the possibility of practical
use of the Hackathon Platform for ecological protection of the
university biosystem to prevent a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affects companies and population's
behaviour. The most significant change occurred in the attitude of
companies to the environment from technical and technological points of
view. To increase their production sustainability, these companies are
looking at the possibilities of waste recovery through sustainable
recycling, or recovery of waste as a source of secondary raw material.
One of the simplest ways is to use agricultural waste for energy
purposes, bringing bioenergy to the forefront as a new area of Industry
4.0. The ALARA model was used to assess the quality of six biosystem
components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, the level of
land pollution with chemicals and littering by the unauthorized dumps;
sufficient volume of green planting on the territory). This allowed the
development of management decisions and environmental protection
measures based on the system of calculated indicators of potential
environmental damage for each of six biosystem components. The forecast
of plan implementation: the quality of four from among six biosystem
components (atmospheric air, water resources, soil layer, sufficient
volume of green planting on the territory) will increase on average by
30-40\%. A minor improvement in the quality of the other biosystem
components (approx. by 10\%) raises concerns about the high probability
of a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shcherbak, Valeriia and Ganushchak-Yefimenko, Liudmyla and Nifatova,

article,Promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African context,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an intervention strategy
for promoting career awareness among IT students in a South African
context, followed by a reflection thereof based on qualitative data
collected from students. Career awareness during study has shown to be a
factor in the work-readiness of IT graduates.
Design/methodology/approach The paper suggests an intervention strategy
aimed at promoting IT students' career awareness. It provides context of
the exit-level higher education (HE) module used to implement the
intervention. Career awareness is achieved by industry talks, projects
and events. Interpretive data collection and content analysis are used
to understand the impact of the intervention from the students'
perspective. Findings Recommendations are made towards productive
interventions for raising career awareness among IT students using
industry participation in higher education. The proposed intervention
comprises of a combination of industry talks, capstone projects and
specific events. Students had largely positive reactions and made
suggestions for additional interventions they would find beneficial. A
hackathon attended proved the most influential where seven out of eight
involved students received job offers from one company. Other students
became aware of their own employability, limitations and preferred
career paths. Originality/value Findings provide confirmation on
existing feasible approaches and also introduces new interventions that
may be generalised to other fields of study. The paper not only provides
an instructional design for a module to raise career awareness but also
reflects on the feedback of the students. The reflection provided by
students acts as a point of reference to ensure that the process
followed for the intervention is practical within a South African
context. The paper highlights the perceived benefits of involving
industry in higher education to raise career awareness, factors that may
prevent career awareness among IT students and valuable suggestions made
by students to further enhance the intervention strategy. An implication
of the research is a set of guidelines identified towards bridging the
IT theory-practice gap. These guidelines can be used by many educators
in similar environments to justify their interventions.","van Rensburg, J. T. Janse and Goede, Roelien","Career awareness; Reflective practice; Industry involvement; Higher

article,"Public sector, open innovation, and collaborative governance in lockdown
times. A research of Spanish cases during the COVID-19 crisis","Purpose
This paper aims to study the results of open innovation initiatives in
Spain under the lockdown during the first stages of the COVID-19 crisis.
Based on the most recent literature on open innovation in the public
sector, this paper explores the following research questions, namely,
what are the key features of collaborative governance processes that
guided open innovation initiatives in the Spanish public sector during
the COVID-19 crises? How open public innovation cases generated public
value to the society during the COVID-19 crises in Spain?
Design/methodology/approach
The study is based on two in-depth case studies of open innovation in
the public sector: the collaborative platform Frena la Curva and the
hackathon Vence al Virus, both launched during the first moments of the
COVID-19 crisis. The methodology is based on 13 semi-structured
interviews, content observation and documentary analysis. The data were
interpreted according to the dimensions described in the analytical
framework: descriptive dimensions of both initiatives but also their
degree of elaboration, incentives and objectives, characteristics of
governance and collaboration between actors and challenges for the
accountability processes; and finally, their procedural legitimacy,
considering the COVID-19 crisis context.
Findings
The results of the study show that citizens have played a key role
during the hardest stage of the crisis, collaborating with governments
and advancing their innovative capabilities, mostly in the digital
sphere. The analysis also identified different outcomes, including the
improvement of citizen's involvement, deliberation practices or network
building. Besides, this paper has identified some limitations and
barriers to open innovation and collaborative governance processes in
terms of accountability and legitimacy of these initiatives. Here, their
contribution was constrained by the emerging stage of implementation and
by the unique circumstances of the lockdown under the COVID-19 crisis.
Research limitations/implications
Future advancements of open innovation initiatives to consolidate
collaborative governance processes will need further exploration.
Although this paper diversified the contacts and the data collection in
the fieldwork to avoid social biases, the results of the interviews
might reflect very positive outcomes. Despite the case studies that took
place during the COVID-19 crisis and their planned actions to maintain
their existence, the post-crisis analysis will be needed to assess the
impact of these open innovation cases in collaborative governance
structures.
Practical implications
Open innovation is an emerging narrative and practice in the public
sector requiring time and energy from public officials and managers. The
study also highlighted the problem of how to legitimate open innovation
cases in the public sector and the implications for their
institutionalization. Public managers involved in these types of
initiatives need to keep the momentum both inside and outside their
organizations. Regarding the utilization of information and
communications technologies (ICTs), open innovation processes do not
need technology to develop their full potential, whereas the COVID-19
crisis and the ongoing digitalization of work settings, accessibility,
etc., could transform ICTs into a critical tool for public managers
leading innovation initiatives within their organizations.
Social implications
The social implications of this paper are manifold. This study provides
evidence of one of the future avenues of public management: open
innovation.
New avenues for the involvement and collaboration of citizens with
public authorities are another social implication pinpointed by this
paper. Democratic legitimacy and procedural accountability are assessed
using the open innovation case studies during the COVID-19 crisis.
Finally, transforming governments using collaborative platforms deserves
social oversight understanding if they really contribute to build trust
in political institutions.
Originality/value
Despite their differences, both Frena la Curva and Vence al Virus
demonstrated the potential and limitations of public innovation and
collaborative governance to cope with an unprecedented crisis such as
the COVID-19. The special features of this emergency, including the long
period of confinement, posed challenges and also opportunities to
develop these initiatives: as several interviewees stated, these
projects helped to channel the civic energy to co-produce solutions in
collaboration with a wide range of actors. Data allow us to identify the
key features of collaborative governance that guided open innovation
initiatives in the Spanish public sector during the COVID-19 crisis.","Ignacio Criado, J. and Guevara-Gomez, Arian","Trust; Collaboration; Accountability; Open innovation; Public
